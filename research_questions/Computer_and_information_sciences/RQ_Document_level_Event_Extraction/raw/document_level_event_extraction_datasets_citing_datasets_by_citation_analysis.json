It serves as a large-scale and fine-grained benchmark, containing 27,000+ events and 180,000+ arguments across 27,485 Wikipedia articles. Researchers use it to evaluate models on various metrics like Span F1, Coref F1, and Head F1, and to address challenges such as limited training data, annotation inconsistencies, and complex event structures. The dataset is also employed for hyper-parameter tuning, cross-domain event extraction, and error analysis in implicit event argument detection."
