historical archives of the University of Athens	https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b34f0a67491539b0eb73436367712255ca3fa1b4 (2008)	https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b29494e7b48ff93178ae9020620da0d6dce24f93 (2006)	The historical archives of the University of Athens are used to test the Block-Based Hough Transform approach for text line detection in unconstrained handwritten Greek documents. This methodology focuses on enhancing the accuracy of text line detection in historical documents, addressing specific challenges related to the variability and complexity of historical handwriting. The dataset's relevance lies in its provision of authentic historical documents, enabling researchers to evaluate and refine text line segmentation techniques effectively.
ANDAR-TL test set	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10032-019-00332-1 (2018)	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2015.7333945 (2015)	The ANDAR-TL test set is used to evaluate the performance of text line segmentation algorithms, specifically in the context of historical documents. It serves as a benchmark in the ICDAR 2015 competition on text line detection, enabling researchers to compare and assess the accuracy and effectiveness of their methods in segmenting text lines from historical documents.
