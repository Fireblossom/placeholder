(2019) use natural language processing tools on electric vehicle patent information extraction and dynamic visualization. To examine which type of invention (“new idea-based” or “old idea-based”) is more likely to stimulate follow-up innovation, Packalen and Bhattacharya (2015) investigate words and word sequences related to a certain technical term as the concept, and count the number of patents that use these concepts. They find that inventions based on new ideas are more likely to stimulate follow-up inventions than those based on old ideas. Kelly et al. (2018) employ similar methods to measure the novelty of patented inventions by searching for new words. However, these studies focus only on the technologies that patents contain, and linguistic methods are used to extract technical terms rather than measure the disclosure level. The use of readability measures in accounting and finance provides us with a precedent for our own use of readability measures with patent documents. Loughran and McDonald (2016) show that the readability of financial documents determines whether readers can reasonably extract the information. Other studies show that the readability of financial reports (usually annual or 10-K reports) may affect investors’ behavior, or be affected by the firm’s performance (Li, 2008; Miller, 2010; You and Zhang, 2009; Lawrence, 2013). We therefore base our study on previous finance literature, but expand it to patent documents and apply a series of computational linguistic measures as proxies for disclosure. 3See Teodorescu (2017) for a comprehensive survey on natural language processing method used in strategic research.",
