(2018) developed a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based cucumber disease detection system using leaf images. The system was used to identify four popular cucumber diseases based on their symptoms. The process included a feature-intensive segmentation of the symptoms. The dataset was augmented by flipping the images vertically and horizontally as well as angular transforms to make the dataset more robust. The authors adopted an 8:2 distribution of the training and validation sets, respectively. The DCNN was implemented by using the MatConvNet function in MATLAB. The results obtained showed that the system performed relatively well when compared with random forest, support vector machine, and AlexNet, with an accuracy of 93.4%. Wallelign et al. (2018) developed a soybean disease recognition system based on the convolutional neural network framework. The model was trained on a 12,673 labeled sample set of soybean images taken under uncontrolled conditions. The CNN model was based on the LeNet framework and included three convolutional layers intertwined by a max pooling layer. Other processes such as segmentation and augmentation were carried out. The experiment included the distribution of the dataset as 70% training set, 10% validation set, and 20% testing set. The experimental result yielded an accuracy of 99.32%. Picon et al.
