          "context_text": "(2021) proposed an approach by employing CNN and ensemble SVM with IoT to detect sugar beet diseases. The authors used various sensors to collect information such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc. The authors have collected 600 hyperspectral images by using HySpexHD. To classify the diseases of sugar beat, ensemble SVM is used, which is non-linear with multilayer classifiers, and also CNN is used. The authors attained a detection accuracy of 80.1% using CNN and 75% using ensemble SVM. The authors did not disclose the number of images collected and used for training and testing the model. This model further improved to find the nutritional deficiency of the plant using various sensors to collect the soil, climate, and environmental information. Tomato Leaf Disease Detection: Deep Learning-based approach is proposed to classify and visualize the symptoms of tomato disease (Brahimi et  al. 2017) by considering the PV dataset (Hughes and Salathé 2015) that consisted of 14,828 tomato leaf images with nine different diseases. Two CNN models, such as AlexNet and GoogleNet, were used with the intention of refining plant disease detection. Pre-processing steps are applied to avoid the background influence on detection accuracy; thus, the background of the image was replaced with black color, and all the original images were re-scale to 256 × 256 . The feature extraction step was used to extract the features using wavelet moment, Gabor Wavelet Transforms (WT), and color moment. The occlusion method is used to visualize the symptoms of the disease. This study claims that the adopted approach performed better by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.18%. In contrast to schematic approaches. Further, the authors exhibit that the pre-trained Deep Learning-based model outperformed as compared to the Deep Learning-based model without pre-train. The authors have used a pre-trained model for training the model, this can be improved using state-of-the-art algorithms to minimize the size of the trained model and computational cost, and the images used in this study are taken in a conditioned environment. Abbas et  al. (2021) proposed tomato plant disease detection approach based on tuning the hyperparameters of DenseNet121 with softmax as an activation function with a learning rate of 0.",

PCA was employed for the feature extraction and attained 83% accuracy with SVM as a classifier. This work could improve by the clustering method with enhanced fitness functions will be made for better segmentation outcomes. Hyperspectral plant photos will be taken into account in the future for remotely identifying diseases in the tea plantation. Wheat Leaf Disease Detection: A Deep Learning-based infield automatic wheat disease detection approach was proposed by a study (Lu et al. 2017a). A deep and multiple instance learning-based supervised learning framework for wheat disease detection was proposed, which can work in complex background infield wheat images. Obtained detection accuracy with VGG-FCN-VD16 and with VGG-FCN-S is 97.95% and 95.12%, respectively. The authors have generated the Wheat Disease Database (WDD). Another study (Picon et  al. 2019) proposed a Residual Neural Network-based DCNN for wheat disease detection by developing a mobile application. It is able to produce classification results within 5 seconds, and it also stores the captured image in the server for posterior statistical analysis. The detection accuracy achieved by the approach is 98% for rust and 96% for septoria disease in real natural conditions pilots. The train test split of the dataset is 80% and 20%, respectively. The system further improves with the sensor data to monitor and assist the nutritional deficiency that enhances the crop yield. Haider et al.
