(2016) showed how beneficial using some pre-trained models was to identify 26 plant diseases. To determine diseases that affect the tomato plant, the authors in Durmuş et al. (2017) carried out an experiment in which the author implemented two deep learning systems, AlexNet and SqueezeNet. For instance, according to Ferentinos (2018), some CNN architectures such as AlexNet, GoogleNet, and VGG have shown a great potential to detect plant diseases, with the achievable success of 97.53%. In the same context, the authors in Zhang et  al. (2018) proposed an approach based on the fine-tuning of the CNN model. The authors have used three models in their study: AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet. According to their results, the ResNet model achieved an accuracy of 97.28%. The authors of Chen et  al. (2020) completed another study. They used the transfer learning technique to detect plant diseases. The different CNN architectures have shown that they can achieve great accuracy. The authors in Too et  al. (2019) have tested several CNN models for plant disease classification, including VGG16, InceptionV4, ResNet50, ResNe101, ResNe152, and DenseNets121.",
