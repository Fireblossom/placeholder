        "title": "An optimal automated disease detection and classification of crop species using hybrid machine learning techniques",
        "abstract": "Agriculture is dependent on the quality and quantity of plant growth worldwide. Many factors, such as weather, pest attack or disease, can cause plant-specific infections. The process of voluntary diagnosis is a long and laborious process, and the farmer cannot determine the cause and effect of the disease. This study proposes the optimal autocorrelation and classification of crop species (OADD-CS) using hybrid machine learning techniques. The first contribution is to propose a non-linear deep neural network (NL-DNN) for processing before removing abnormal image angles from the input image. Next, the edge target detection (ETD) algorithm is used to calculate the top and bottom leaf edges and extract the feature. Finally, hybrid crow-optimization-based convolutional neural network (HCO-CNN) classifiers are used to diagnose other diseases. Here we consider a dataset of over a million images taken with a mobile phone in real field conditions. This data set includes 17 diseases for 5 crops and 5 equally distributed diseases, with multiple diseases present in the same image. Specific work can be performed on MATLAB tools, and performance is compared to traditional complex work.",

Its bark is used in folk medicine as tranquilizer, sedative and insomnia. This study aimed to characterize the stem and leaf anatomy and to provide subsidies to quality control of the plant drug due to its wide use in folk medicine as well as its differentiation from other species with the same popular name. Samples were collected at Cuite, in Paraiba State, Brazil, fixed in FAA50, semipermanent slides were made, following usual procedures in plant anatomy. The stem shows a cylindrical contour, covered by a uniseriate epidermis covered by a thickened cuticle. It shows claviform glandular and branched trichomes with uniseriate stalk. Secretory cavities are into the phloem. The leaf epidermis has branched and glandular trichomes and anisocytic and paracytic stomata, on both sides, with predominance of branched trichomes and stomata on abaxial surface. Secretory cavities in stem and leaf, types of trichomes and stomata, its location and distribution constitute diagnostic characters for this specie. The structural characterization of the stem and leaf allows its distinction from other ones of this genus, ensuring safety for commercial pharmacological uses, allowing certification of the authenticity of raw material.",

        "abstract": "Plant diseases threaten global food security by reducing crop yield; thus, diagnosing plant diseases is critical to agricultural production. Artificial intelligence technologies gradually replace traditional plant disease diagnosis methods due to their time-consuming, costly, inefficient, and subjective disadvantages. As a mainstream AI method, deep learning has substantially improved plant disease detection and diagnosis for precision agriculture. In the meantime, most of the existing plant disease diagnosis methods usually adopt a pre-trained deep learning model to support diagnosing diseased leaves. However, the commonly used pre-trained models are from the computer vision dataset, not the botany dataset, which barely provides the pre-trained models sufficient domain knowledge about plant disease. Furthermore, this pre-trained way makes the final diagnosis model more difficult to distinguish between different plant diseases and lowers the diagnostic precision. To address this issue, we propose a series of commonly used pre-trained models based on plant disease images to promote the performance of disease diagnosis. In addition, we have experimented with the plant disease pre-trained model on plant disease diagnosis tasks such as plant disease identification, plant disease detection, plant disease segmentation, and other subtasks. The extended experiments prove that the plant disease pre-trained model can achieve higher accuracy than the existing pre-trained model with less training time, thereby supporting the better diagnosis of plant diseases. In addition, our pre-trained models will be open-sourced at https://pd.samlab.cn/ and Zenodo platform https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7856293.",

The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. is based on an inverted residual structure where the shortcut connections are between the thin bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on ImageNet [1] classification, COCO object detection [2], VOC image segmentation [3]. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as actual latency, and the number of parameters.",

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections&#x2014;one between each layer and its subsequent layer&#x2014;our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance.

Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves, with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge, this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images in order to create a database, assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe, a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre, was used to perform the deep CNN training. The experimental results on the developed model achieved precision between 91% and 98%, for separate class tests, on average 96.3%.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in many different visual tasks. Learned from a large-scale training data set, CNN features are much more discriminative and accurate than the handcrafted features. Moreover, CNN features are also transferable among different domains. On the other hand, traditional dictionary-based features (such as BoW and spatial pyramid matching) contain much more local discriminative and structural information, which is implicitly embedded in the images. To further improve the performance, in this paper, we propose to combine CNN with dictionary-based models for scene recognition and visual domain adaptation (DA). Specifically, based on the well-tuned CNN models (e.g., AlexNet and VGG Net), two dictionary-based representations are further constructed, namely, mid-level local representation (MLR) and convolutional Fisher vector (CFV) representation. In MLR, an efficient two-stage clustering method, i.e., weighted spatial and feature space spectral clustering on the parts of a single image followed by clustering all representative parts of all images, is used to generate a class-mixture or a class-specific part dictionary. After that, the part dictionary is used to operate with the multiscale image inputs for generating mid-level representation. In CFV, a multiscale and scale-proportional Gaussian mixture model training strategy is utilized to generate Fisher vectors based on the last convolutional layer of CNN. By integrating the complementary information of MLR, CFV, and the CNN features of the fully connected layer, the state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on scene recognition and DA problems. An interested finding is that our proposed hybrid representation (from VGG net trained on ImageNet) is also complementary to GoogLeNet and/or VGG-11 (trained on Place205) greatly.",

Accurate recognition of insect pests facilitates timely preventive measures to avoid economic losses. However, the existing datasets for the visual classification task mainly focus on common objects, e.g., flowers and dogs. This limits the application of powerful deep learning technology on specific domains like the agricultural field. In this paper, we collect a large-scale dataset named IP102 for insect pest recognition. Specifically, it contains more than 75, 000 images belonging to 102 categories, which exhibit a natural long-tailed distribution. In addition, we annotate about 19, 000 images with bounding boxes for object detection. The IP102 has a hierarchical taxonomy and the insect pests which mainly affect one specific agricultural product are grouped into the same upperlevel category. Furthermore, we perform several baseline experiments on the IP102 dataset, including handcrafted and deep feature based classification methods. Experimental results show that this dataset has the challenges of interand intra- class variance and data imbalance. We believe our IP102 will facilitate future research on practical insect pest control, fine-grained visual classification, and imbalanced learning fields. We make the dataset and pre-trained models publicly available at https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102.",

            "abstract": "With the advancement of image processing and computer vision technology, content-based product search is applied in a wide variety of common tasks, such as online shopping, automatic checkout systems, and intelligent logistics. Given a product image as a query, existing product search systems mainly perform the retrieval process using predefined databases with fixed product categories. However, real-world applications often require inserting new categories or updating existing products in the product database. When using existing product search methods, the image feature extraction models must be retrained and database indexes must be rebuilt to accommodate the updated data, and these operations incur high costs for data annotation and training time. To this end, we propose a few-shot incremental product search framework with meta-learning, which requires very few annotated images and has a reasonable training time. In particular, our framework contains a multipooling-based product feature extractor that learns a discriminative representation for each product, and we also design a meta-learning-based feature adapter to guarantee the robustness of the few-shot features. Furthermore, when expanding new categories in batches during a product search, we reconstruct the few-shot features by using an incremental weight combiner to accommodate the incremental search task. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves excellent performance for new products while still guaranteeing the high search accuracy of the base categories after gradually expanding new product categories without forgetting.",

Appropriate and timely deployment of disease management depends on early disease detection. Incorrect and delayed diagnosis can result in either excessive or inadequate use of chemicals, with increased production costs and increased environmental and health impacts. Methods and Results We have manually captured 3651 high‐quality, real‐life symptom images of multiple apple foliar diseases, with variable illumination, angles, surfaces, and noise. A subset of images, expert‐annotated to create a pilot data set for apple scab, cedar apple rust, and healthy leaves, was made available to the Kaggle community for the Plant Pathology Challenge as part of the Fine‐Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) workshop at the 2020 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference (CVPR 2020). Participants were asked to use the image data set to train a machine learning model to classify disease categories and develop an algorithm for disease severity quantification. The top three area under the ROC curve (AUC) values submitted to the private leaderboard were 0.98445, 0.98182, and 0.98089. We also trained an off‐the‐shelf convolutional neural network on this data for disease classification and achieved 97% accuracy on a held‐out test set. Discussion This data set will contribute toward development and deployment of machine learning–based automated plant disease classification algorithms to ultimately realize fast and accurate disease detection. We will continue to add images to the pilot data set for a larger, more comprehensive expert‐annotated data set for future Kaggle competitions and to explore more advanced methods for disease classification and quantification.",

Manual detection of blight disease can be cumbersome and may require trained experts. To overcome these issues, we present an automated system using the Mask Region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) architecture, with residual network as the backbone network for detecting blight disease patches on potato leaves in field conditions. The approach uses transfer learning, which can generate good results even with small datasets. The model was trained on a dataset of 1423 images of potato leaves obtained from fields in different geographical locations and at different times of the day. The images were manually annotated to create over 6200 labeled patches covering diseased and healthy portions of the leaf. The Mask R-CNN model was able to correctly differentiate between the diseased patch on the potato leaf and the similar-looking background soil patches, which can confound the outcome of binary classification. To improve the detection performance, the original RGB dataset was then converted to HSL, HSV, LAB, XYZ, and YCrCb color spaces. A separate model was created for each color space and tested on 417 field-based test images. This yielded 81.4% mean average precision on the LAB model and 56.9% mean average recall on the HSL model, slightly outperforming the original RGB color space model. Manual analysis of the detection performance indicates an overall precision of 98% on leaf images in a field environment containing complex backgrounds.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Fruit yield estimation is crucial for establishing fruit harvest and marketing strategies. Recently, computer vision and deep learning techniques have been used to estimate citrus fruit yield and have exhibited notable fruit detection ability. However, computer-vision-based citrus fruit counting has two key limitations: inconsistent fruit detection accuracy and double-counting of the same fruit. Using oranges as the experimental material, this paper proposes a deep-learning-based orange counting algorithm using video sequences to help overcome these problems. The algorithm consists of two sub-algorithms, OrangeYolo for fruit detection and OrangeSort for fruit tracking. The OrangeYolo backbone network is partially based on the YOLOv3 algorithm, which has been improved upon to detect small objects (fruits) at multiple scales. The network structure was adjusted to detect small-scale targets while enabling multiscale target detection. A channel attention and spatial attention multiscale fusion module was introduced to fuse the semantic features of the deep network with the shallow textural detail features. OrangeYolo can achieve mean Average Precision (mAP) values of 0.957 in the citrus dataset, higher than the 0.905, 0.911, and 0.917 achieved with the YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5 algorithms. OrangeSort was designed to alleviate the double-counting problem associated with occluded fruits. A specific tracking region counting strategy and tracking algorithm based on motion displacement estimation were established. Six video sequences taken from two fields containing 22 trees were used as the validation dataset. The proposed method showed better performance (Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 0.081, Standard Deviation (SD) = 0.08) than video-based manual counting and produced more accurate results than the existing standards Sort and DeepSort (MAE = 0.45 and 1.212; SD = 0.4741 and 1.3975).",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the integration of smartphone technology with novel sensing technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms has revolutionized crop pest and disease surveillance. Efficient and accurate diagnosis is crucial to mitigate substantial economic losses in agriculture caused by diseases and pests. An innovative Apple® and Android™ mobile application for citizen science has been developed, to enable real-time detection and identification of plant leaf diseases and pests, minimizing their impact on horticulture, viticulture, and olive cultivation. Leveraging DL algorithms, this application facilitates efficient data collection on crop pests and diseases, supporting crop yield protection and cost reduction in alignment with the Green Deal goal for 2030 by reducing pesticide use. The proposed citizen science tool involves all Farm to Fork stakeholders and farm citizens in minimizing damage to plant health by insect and fungal diseases. It utilizes comprehensive datasets, including images of various diseases and insects, within a robust Decision Support System (DSS) where DL models operate. The DSS connects directly with users, allowing them to upload crop pest data via the mobile application, providing data-driven support and information. The application stands out for its scalability and interoperability, enabling the continuous integration of new data to enhance its capabilities. It supports AI-based imaging analysis of quarantine pests, invasive alien species, and emerging and native pests, thereby aiding post-border surveillance programs. The mobile application, developed using a Python-based REST API, PostgreSQL, and Keycloak, has been field-tested, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world agriculture scenarios, such as detecting Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) infestation in tomato cultivations. The outcomes of this study in T. absoluta detection serve as a showcase scenario for the proposed citizen science tool’s applicability and usability, demonstrating a 70.2% accuracy (mAP50) utilizing advanced DL models. Notably, during field testing, the model achieved detection confidence levels of up to 87%, enhancing pest management practices.",

            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

Although there is a long history of public engagement in agriculture and food science, the term ‘citizen science’ has rarely been applied to these efforts. Similarly, in the emerging field of citizen science, most new citizen science projects do not focus on food or agriculture. Here, we convened thought leaders from a broad range of fields related to citizen science, agriculture, and food science to highlight key opportunities for bridging these overlapping yet disconnected communities/fields and identify ways to leverage their respective strengths. Specifically, we show that (i) citizen science projects are addressing many grand challenges facing our food systems, as outlined by the United States National Institute of Food and Agriculture, as well as broader Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations Development Programme, (ii) there exist emerging opportunities and unique challenges for citizen science in agriculture/food research, and (iii) the greatest opportunities for the development of citizen science projects in agriculture and food science will be gained by using the existing infrastructure and tools of Extension programmes and through the engagement of urban communities. Further, we argue there is no better time to foster greater collaboration between these fields given the trend of shrinking Extension programmes, the increasing need to apply innovative solutions to address rising demands on agricultural systems, and the exponential growth of the field of citizen science.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was designed from first principles to support an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.",

Holistic Management makes this point in many ways and contexts, and earlier chapters in this handbook have repeated it. In any situation you manage, you should be monitoring to make happen what you want to happen—to bring about desired changes in line with your holistic context. Monitoring developments in the ecological sphere, however, deserves its own treatment because much of what we do as land managers may lead to unanticipated effects. Anytime you plan to alter ecosystem processes in any way, assume you could be wrong because the land is more complex than humans will ever understand.",

Plant diseases may be caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungus, among others. Early detection and classification of these diseases allow farmers to reduce the instances and control the effect that the disease may have on their crops. Therefore, this study utilizes machine learning models for the clustering, prediction, and classification of tomato plant diseases in Palestine. The study used 3000 smartphone digital images of five tomato plant diseases (Alternaria Solani; Botrytis Cinerea; Panonychus Citri; Phytophthora Infestans; Tuta Absoluta) collected from three districts across the West Bank (Tulkarem, Jenin, and Tubas). The machine learning models used image embedding and hierarchical clustering techniques in clustering, and the neural network, random Forest, naïve Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic regression for prediction and classification. The models’ accuracy was validated in reference to a tomato plant diseases database created by plant pathogens experts. The clustering model provided 7 diseases clustering with an accuracy rate of 70%, while the neural network and logistic regression models reported performance accuracies of 70.3% and 68.9% respectively. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach provides acceptable accuracy rates in the clustering, detection, and classification of tomato plant disease. Thus, the deployment of machine learning techniques in the agriculture sector might help Palestinian farmers better manage and control tomato diseases.",

            "abstract": "Early detection and efficient management practices to control Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) infestation is crucial for safeguarding tomato production yield and minimizing economic losses. This study investigates the detection of T. absoluta infestation on tomato plants using object detection models combined with ensemble techniques. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of utilizing a dataset captured in real settings in open-field and greenhouse environments to address the complexity of real-life challenges in object detection of plant health scenarios. The effectiveness of deep-learning-based models, including Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet, was evaluated in terms of detecting T. absoluta damage. The initial model evaluations revealed diminishing performance levels across various model configurations, including different backbones and heads. To enhance detection predictions and improve mean Average Precision (mAP) scores, ensemble techniques were applied such as Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft NMS), Non-Maximum Weighted (NMW), and Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF). The outcomes shown that the WBF technique significantly improved the mAP scores, resulting in a 20% improvement from 0.58 (max mAP from individual models) to 0.70. The results of this study contribute to the field of agricultural pest detection by emphasizing the potential of deep learning and ensemble techniques in improving the accuracy and reliability of object detection models.",

        "abstract": "Plant diseases represent serious risks to the world’s agricultural sector, resulting in large crop losses and affecting the availability of food. An accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to the successful management of any disease. This study addresses this challenge through the development of a plant disease detection system. The proposed model is built upon the ResNet-50 architecture, a deep learning framework known for its process in image classification tasks. Benefits of ResNet-50 include accurate diagnosis of plant diseases from pictures, even when diseases have similar visual traits. The skip links in the architecture reduce the problems caused by disappearing gradients, making it easier to train on deeper networks and improving accuracy. The dataset employed in this study encompasses color, grayscale, and segmented directories, each housing instances of 38 different plant disease classes Studies using the ResNet-50 model use transfer learning using initially pre-trained weights from a large dataset of generic images. Later refinement of a particular plant disease dataset will improve the model and its performance. This approach accelerates convergence, improves accuracy, and reduces training time, contributing to the efficiency of disease diagnosis. The application of the ResNet-50 model, along with the various directories, provides the model’s adaptability and accuracy across a wide range of plant species. The suggested model accurately and efficiently diagnoses plant diseases by utilizing the advantages of the ResNet-50 algorithm architecture with the deliberate application of transfer learning.",

The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

Thermal imaging provides a fast and non-destructive way of scanning plants for diseased regions and has been used by various researchers to study the effect of disease on the thermal profile of a plant. However, thermal image of a plant affected by disease has been known to be affected by environmental conditions which include leaf angles and depth of the canopy areas accessible to the thermal imaging camera. In this paper, we combine thermal and visible light image data with depth information and develop a machine learning system to remotely detect plants infected with the tomato powdery mildew fungus Oidium neolycopersici. We extract a novel feature set from the image data using local and global statistics and show that by combining these with the depth information, we can considerably improve the accuracy of detection of the diseased plants. In addition, we show that our novel feature set is capable of identifying plants which were not originally inoculated with the fungus at the start of the experiment but which subsequently developed disease through natural transmission.",

Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.",

Their effects range from mild symptoms to catastrophes in which large areas planted to food crops are destroyed. Catastrophic plant disease exacerbates the current deficit of food supply in which at least 800 million people are inadequately fed. Plant pathogens are difficult to control because their populations are variable in time, space, and genotype. Most insidiously, they evolve, often overcoming the resistance that may have been the hard-won achievement of the plant breeder. In order to combat the losses they cause, it is necessary to define the problem and seek remedies. At the biological level, the requirements are for the speedy and accurate identification of the causal organism, accurate estimates of the severity of disease and its effect on yield, and identification of its virulence mechanisms. Disease may then be minimized by the reduction of the pathogen's inoculum, inhibition of its virulence mechanisms, and promotion of genetic diversity in the crop. Conventional plant breeding for resistance has an important role to play that can now be facilitated by marker-assisted selection. There is also a role for transgenic modification with genes that confer resistance. At the political level, there is a need to acknowledge that plant diseases threaten our food supplies and to devote adequate resources to their control.",

Concerning plant disease detection, deep learning methods frequently encounter limitations stemming from their high computational costs and exacting technical requirements. Therefore, this study utilizes machine learning techniques over deep learning to reduce costs and effectively manage the technical complexities involved. This research introduces a novel Stacking Ensemble Classifier model for enhancing the accuracy of Apple leaf disease diagnosis. By integrating four base classifiers—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LGBM—the Stacking Ensemble Classifier achieves notable improvements in prediction accuracy through robust image preprocessing and extensive hyperparameter tuning. The study leverages a dataset of over 5700 Apple leaf images sourced from PlantVillage. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved superior performance, surpassing individual existing machine learning classifiers with an outstanding accuracy of 98.44%. This approach maintains high detection rates while reducing computational overhead, outperforming other existing classifiers in accuracy as well as significant performance parameters comprising precision, recall, and F1-score.",

            "abstract": "The countries of the Indian subcontinent are indeed very reliant on agriculture for their daily necessities. Among that country, the majority of agricultural production in Bangladesh is categorized as traditional subsistence farming. Rice, wheat, corn, legumes, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, seafood, and dairy products are among the agricultural products manufactured in Bangladesh. The main staple food of Bangladesh is rice. The scarcity of arable land and natural resources emphasizes the significance of creating innovative agricultural technologies to improve productivity and satisfy future demand. Precision agriculture is a difficult task to execute. In this study, we used meteorological data obtained from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and Bangladesh Meteorological Department from more than 8 districts in Bangladesh over 45 years. The primary objective of this study is to create a one-of-a-kind machine learning model utilizing seven environmental factors. Our model also improves forecast accuracy of the best qualities for overcoming hunger challenges. Based on our collected Aus rice dataset, we utilized voting regression (VR) with a novel combination of MLA. The VR’s concept is to integrate MLA and return the average anticipated values. Compared with other MLA, our proposed algorithm achieved the highest R2 of 0.8928 in a study on Aus rice yield prediction. In addition, we proposed a self-designed IoT device to automatically gather data from agricultural fields and thereby increase crop production forecasts by incorporating the data into our proposed model. The proposed system will indeed be immensely helpful to a country’s agro-economic advancement.",

The model is a combination of MobileNet and EfficientNet, and the Model is trained from the PlantVillage Dataset. One of the main objectives of the study is to enhance the ability to distinguish between visually similar diseases, a universal problem of plant pathology. Lack of data is then solved by using transfer learning from pre-trained networks as well as further image augmentation. Further, optimization techniques are employed in work to get faster inference and minimal device usage on mobile platform but keeping the diagnostic accuracy high.

A variety of automated machine learning methods have been suggested in prior research to find them. The majority of these methods operate at the release level, which means they try to foresee which files might be vulnerable in a future version. Manually detecting insecure code is both challenging and costly in both time and money. Therefore, to reduce costs, developers must use automatic vulnerability prediction (AVP) techniques. Recent AVP research has started to employ deep learning (DL) methods. All of the suggested methods are built on feature extraction techniques that were influenced by earlier DL uses such as autonomous language processing. When developing AVP models based on traditional machine learning, code metrics were frequently employed as features. The following piece provides a method centered on deep neural networks over leveraging code metrics to detect vulnerabilities in code, bridging the difference between machine learning parameters and deep learning. Results obtained indicate that while code metrics are excellent, they weren't the best to use as DL-based AVP characteristics.",

This paper proposes a deep learning model for agricultural crop disease identification based on AlexNet and Inception-V4. AlexNet and Inception-V4 are combined and modified to achieve an efficient but good performance. Experimental results on the expanded PlantVillage dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the compared methods: AlexNet, VGG11, Zenit, and VGG16, in terms of accuracy and F1 scores. The proposed model obtains the highest accuracy for corn, tomato, grape, and apple: 94.5%, 94.8%, 92.3%, and 96.5%, respectively. Also, the highest F1 scores for corn, tomato, grape, and apple: 0.938, 0.910, 0.945, and 0.924, respectively, are obtained. The results indicate that the proposed method has promising generalization ability in crop disease identification.",

            "abstract": "Multi-class pest detection is one of the crucial components in pest management involving localization in addition to classification which is much more difficult than generic object detection because of the apparent differences among pest species. This paper proposes a region-based end-to-end approach named PestNet for large-scale multi-class pest detection and classification based on deep learning. PestNet consists of three major parts. First, a novel module channel–spatial attention (CSA) is proposed to be fused into the convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone for feature extraction and enhancement. The second one is called region proposal network (RPN) that is adopted for providing region proposals as potential pest positions based on extracted feature maps from images. Position-sensitive score map (PSSM), the third component, is used to replace fully connected (FC) layers for pest classification and bounding box regression. Furthermore, we apply contextual regions of interest (RoIs) as contextual information of pest features to improve detection accuracy. We evaluate PestNet on our newly collected large-scale pests’ image dataset, Multi-class Pests Dataset 2018 (MPD2018) captured by our designed task-specific image acquisition equipment, covering more than 80k images with over 580k pests labeled by agricultural experts and categorized in 16 classes. The experimental results show that the proposed PestNet performs well on multi-class pest detection with 75.46% mean average precision (mAP), which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

In order to improve the detection accuracy and efficiency, an early diagnosis method for ATLDs based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed. We first collect the images of apple tree leaves with and without diseases from both laboratories and cultivation fields, and establish dataset containing five common ATLDs and healthy leaves. The DCNN model proposed in this paper for ATLDs recognition combines DenseNet and Xception, using global average pooling instead of fully connected layers. We extract features by the proposed convolutional neural network then use a support vector machine to classify the apple leaf diseases. Including the proposed DCNN, several DCNNs are trained for ATLDs recognition. The proposed network achieves an overall accuracy of 98.82% in identifying the ATLDs, which is higher than Inception-v3, MobileNet, VGG-16, DenseNet-201, Xception, VGG-INCEP. Moreover, the proposed model has the fastest convergence rate, and a relatively small number of parameters and high robustness compared with the mentioned models. This research indicates that the proposed deep learning model provides a better solution for ATLDs control. It could be also integrated into smart apple cultivation systems.",

In this paper, the leaf images of 9 different plants with 32 different classes of the PlantVillage database are analyzed for the process. The main contribution of this work is to classify the plant leaf disease with the proposed networkbased on AlexNet and comparing with the traditional support vector machine. The convolutional neural network is used to detect the plant leaf and identify the healthy and diseased plant through this network. The mixed combination of healthy and diseased plant leaf data is used for training the convolutional neural network. Transfer learning is used for the pre-trained AlexNet network for a different amount of data for training of the network, and results are validated with a support vector machine and deep learning classifier. AlexNet performed well with an accuracy of 91.15% as compared to SVM giving 88.96% and 89.69% for radial basis function kernel and linear kernel respectively.",

            "title": "AI-Driven Framework for Recognition of Guava Plant Diseases through Machine Learning from DSLR Camera Sensor Based High Resolution Imagery",
            "abstract": "Plant diseases can cause a considerable reduction in the quality and number of agricultural products. Guava, well known to be the tropics’ apple, is one significant fruit cultivated in tropical regions. It is attacked by 177 pathogens, including 167 fungal and others such as bacterial, algal, and nematodes. In addition, postharvest diseases may cause crucial production loss. Due to minor variations in various guava disease symptoms, an expert opinion is required for disease analysis. Improper diagnosis may cause economic losses to farmers’ improper use of pesticides. Automatic detection of diseases in plants once they emerge on the plants’ leaves and fruit is required to maintain high crop fields. In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven framework is presented to detect and classify the most common guava plant diseases. The proposed framework employs the Δ E color difference image segmentation to segregate the areas infected by the disease. Furthermore, color (RGB, HSV) histogram and textural (LBP) features are applied to extract rich, informative feature vectors. The combination of color and textural features are used to identify and attain similar outcomes compared to individual channels, while disease recognition is performed by employing advanced machine-learning classifiers (Fine KNN, Complex Tree, Boosted Tree, Bagged Tree, Cubic SVM). The proposed framework is evaluated on a high-resolution (18 MP) image dataset of guava leaves and fruit. The best recognition results were obtained by Bagged Tree classifier on a set of RGB, HSV, and LBP features (99% accuracy in recognizing four guava fruit diseases (Canker, Mummification, Dot, and Rust) against healthy fruit). The proposed framework may help the farmers to avoid possible production loss by taking early precautions.",

In recent years, malicious applications are increasingly rampant, which threaten users and society as security challenges to network reliability and management. However, due to neglecting the sequential features between network flows, existing malicious application recognition methods based on network traffic analysis have low recognition accuracy. Based on the network traffic characteristics of Android applications, this paper firstly applies Long Short-Term Memory network-based variational Auto-Encoder to extract the sequential feature of the application running time. Then, we design the BP neural network for initial classification and connect the class vector output of the BP neural network with the original data. The output is fed into the cascade forest for further feature learning and classification. The integrated methods are easy to implement with data independency and efficiency. We conduct experiments to evaluate the proposed with Android malware dataset CICAndMal2017, with a 97.29% high accuracy, comparatively significant precision and recall rates when benchmarked against other methods.",

        "abstract": "Plant disease is a significant health concern among all living creatures. Early diagnosis can help farmers take necessary steps to cure the disease and accelerate the production rate efficiently. Our research has been conducted with five most common rice leaf diseases, such as bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast,leaf scald, and narrow brown spot, including healthy class, and two categories of betel leaf, such as healthy and unhealthy class. A robust new deep ensemble model, based on InceptionResNetV2, EfficientNetV2L,and Xception, has been proposed, known as PlantDet, in this research. PlantDet solves not only underfitting problems but also leverage nourished performances simultaneously for scarce dataset of the sparse number of different background image dataset. PlantDet integrates efficient data augmentation, preprocessing, Global Average Pooling layer, Dropout mechanism, L2 regularizers, PReLU activation function, Batch Normalization layers, and more Dense layers that make the model more robust compared to all existing models and help to handle underfitting and overfitting problems while maintaining high performance. PlantDet exceeds the previous state-of-art model for the Rice Leaf dataset with an Accuracy of 98.53%, a Precision of 98.50%, a Recall of 98.35%, a F1 of 98.42% and a Specificity of 99.71%. In addition, for the Betel Leaf dataset, PlantDet also surpassed all existing base models, including several robust ensemble models. Finally, Grad-CAM and Score-CAM have been accomplished with the Xception method to explain the model performances particularly to elaborate how the Deep Learning (DL) models works for this complex dataset. Score-CAM slightly outperformed Grad-CAM++ in terms of localizing the predicted area.",

            "abstract": "Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on the learnable activation and advanced initialization, we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66% [33]). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass the reported human-level performance (5.1%, [26]) on this dataset.",

            "abstract": "Alternaria leaf spot, Brown spot, Mosaic, Grey spot, and Rust are five common types of apple leaf diseases that severely affect apple yield. However, the existing research lacks an accurate and fast detector of apple diseases for ensuring the healthy development of the apple industry. This paper proposes a deep learning approach that is based on improved convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the real-time detection of apple leaf diseases. In this paper, the apple leaf disease dataset (ALDD), which is composed of laboratory images and complex images under real field conditions, is first constructed via data augmentation and image annotation technologies. Based on this, a new apple leaf disease detection model that uses deep-CNNs is proposed by introducing the GoogLeNet Inception structure and Rainbow concatenation. Finally, under the hold-out testing dataset, using a dataset of 26,377 images of diseased apple leaves, the proposed INAR-SSD (SSD with Inception module and Rainbow concatenation) model is trained to detect these five common apple leaf diseases. The experimental results show that the INAR-SSD model realizes a detection performance of 78.80% mAP on ALDD, with a high-detection speed of 23.13 FPS. The results demonstrate that the novel INAR-SSD model provides a high-performance solution for the early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases that can perform real-time detection of these diseases with higher accuracy and faster detection speed than previous methods.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. \nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

However, paddy crops are susceptible to diseases such as brown spot, hispa, leaf smut, leaf blast, bacterial leaf blight, and cotton mold. The purpose of this article is to identify paddy leaf diseases. The proposed scheme is built using CNN with a pre-trained ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, VGG-19, EfficientNet, Inspection-V2, and GoogleNet library. A ReLU classifier is used to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the identification process. This model can help the farmer recognize the paddy leaf condition as a primary diagnosis, and it can also help the agriculturist verify his prediction by examining the paddy leaf. Traditional laboratory procedures are both costly and time-consuming. This paper’s proposed paddy lead disease detection system will identify and diagnose five classes of paddy leaf conditions. The system’s highest average accuracy for all five identifications is 96.27 percent for the ResNet-50 pre-trained library, and the F1 Score is 98.19 percent. GoogleNet has the lowest classification accuracy of 86 percent. The accuracy can be maximized by expanding the dataset. This technology will take less time and less money to diagnose paddy leaf conditions than traditional procedures, and it will aim to maximize the production of paddy.",

            "abstract": "Rice disease classification is vital during the cultivation of rice crops. However, rice diseases were initially detected by visual examination from agricultural experts. Later the detection process progressed to automation, which involved images. The images captured lead to a lack of supporting information. The traditional approaches are less accurate when used with real time images. To address this limitation, a novel Rice Transformer is proposed in the paper that merges inputs from agricultural sensors and image data captured from the fields simultaneously. The proposed system consists of two branches: the sensor and image branches. Specifically, the attention approach is employed to extract the features from both modalities. Later, the extracted features are sent to the cross-attention module as input in a crisscross fashion, enhancing the ability to identify the features specific to rice diseases. The extracted features are further pooled, merged, and later passed through the Softmax classifier to classify the rice disease precisely. The dataset collected is a customized dataset with 4200 samples collected on a real-time basis from rice farms. The experiments conducted on the dataset represent that the proposed approach outperforms all the other fusion and attention models considered for comparison in this paper. The ablation analysis and performance metrics are measured to determine the effectiveness of the proposed system. The results achieved are quite promising as the proposed Rice transformer model achieves an accuracy of 97.38% for controlling rice disease.",

Plant disease may cause significant losses in food production and eradicate diversity in species. Early diagnosis of plant diseases using accurate or automatic detection techniques can enhance the quality of food production and minimize economic losses. In recent years, deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in the recognition accuracy of image classification and object detection systems. Hence, in this paper, we utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pre-trained models for efficient plant disease identification. We focused on fine tuning the hyperparameters of popular pre-trained models, such as DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4. The experiments were carried out using the popular PlantVillage dataset, which has 54,305 image samples of different plant disease species in 38 classes. The performance of the model was evaluated through classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. A comparative analysis was also performed with similar state-of-the-art studies. The experiments proved that DenseNet-121 achieved 99.81% higher classification accuracy, which was superior to state-of-the-art models.",

Addressing issues of inaccurate detection and unstable accuracy rates encountered in traditional disease diagnosis processes, particularly concerning small-sized disease targets, we introduce an approach that incorporates an attention mechanism for detecting small disease lesions. The experimental dataset comprises annotated image samples of various common plant diseases affecting a range of crops including legumes, strawberries, and tomatoes. After preprocessing and transforming the dataset into a format suitable for input into the YOLOv8 model, and conducting targeted optimization training on the model, we compared its accuracy with commonly used disease detection models. Our identification model demonstrated relatively high efficiency in recognizing diseases in these three types of crops, thus carrying significant research implications for intelligent agricultural monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have boosted the performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown superior performance to that of the conventional machine learning algorithms. Recently, a novel type of neural networks called capsule networks (CapsNets) was presented to improve the most advanced CNNs. In this paper, we present a modified two-layer CapsNet with limited training samples for HSI classification, which is inspired by the comparability and simplicity of the shallower deep learning models. The presented CapsNet is trained using two real HSI datasets, i.e., the PaviaU (PU) and SalinasA datasets, representing complex and simple datasets, respectively, and which are used to investigate the robustness or representation of every model or classifier. In addition, a comparable paradigm of network architecture design has been proposed for the comparison of CNN and CapsNet. Experiments demonstrate that CapsNet shows better accuracy and convergence behavior for the complex data than the state-of-the-art CNN. For CapsNet using the PU dataset, the Kappa coefficient, overall accuracy, and average accuracy are 0.9456, 95.90%, and 96.27%, respectively, compared to the corresponding values yielded by CNN of 0.9345, 95.11%, and 95.63%. Moreover, we observed that CapsNet has much higher confidence for the predicted probabilities. Subsequently, this finding was analyzed and discussed with probability maps and uncertainty analysis. In terms of the existing literature, CapsNet provides promising results and explicit merits in comparison with CNN and two baseline classifiers, i.e., random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs).",

In order to boost the representational power of a network, several recent approaches have shown the benefit of enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the \"Squeeze-and-Excitation\" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We demonstrate that by stacking these blocks together, we can construct SENet architectures that generalise extremely well across challenging datasets. Crucially, we find that SE blocks produce significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures at minimal additional computational cost. SENets formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and significantly reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, achieving a ~25% relative improvement over the winning entry of 2016.

Aiming to solve this problem, this paper proposes a method for identifying infected Lentinus edodes sticks based on improved ResNeXt-50(32 × 4d) deep transfer learning. First, a dataset of Lentinus edodes stick diseases was constructed. Second, based on the ResNeXt-50(32 × 4d) model and the pretraining weight of the ImageNet dataset, the influence of pretraining weight parameters on recognition accuracy was studied. Finally, six fine-tuning strategies of the fully connected layer were designed to modify the fully connected layer of ResNeXt-50(32 × 4d). The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the method proposed in this paper can reach 94.27%, which is higher than the Vgg16, GoogLeNet, ResNet50, and MobileNet v2 models by 8.47%, 6.49%, 4.68%, and 9.38%, respectively, and the F1-score can reach 0.9422. The improved method proposed in this paper can reduce the calculation pressure and overfitting problem of the model, improve the accuracy of the model in the identification of Lentinus edodes stick mold diseases, and provide an effective solution for the selection of diseased sticks.",

        "abstract": "Subsistence farmers and global food security depend on sufficient food production, which aligns with the UN's “Zero Hunger,” “Climate Action,” and “Responsible Consumption and Production” sustainable development goals. In addition to already available methods for early disease detection and classification facing overfitting and fine feature extraction complexities during the training process, how early signs of green attacks can be identified or classified remains uncertain. Most pests and disease symptoms are seen in plant leaves and fruits, yet their diagnosis by experts in the laboratory is expensive, tedious, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. Notably, how plant pests and diseases can be appropriately detected and timely prevented is a hotspot paradigm in smart, sustainable agriculture remains unknown. In recent years, deep transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous advances in the recognition accuracy of object detection and image classification systems since these frameworks utilize previously acquired knowledge to solve similar problems more effectively and quickly. Therefore, in this research, we introduce two plant disease detection (PDDNet) models of early fusion (AE) and the lead voting ensemble (LVE) integrated with nine pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fine-tuned by deep feature extraction for efficient plant disease identification and classification. The experiments were carried out on 15 classes of the popular PlantVillage dataset, which has 54,305 image samples of different plant disease species in 38 categories. Hyperparameter fine-tuning was done with popular pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, ResNet101, ResNet50, GoogleNet, AlexNet, ResNet18, EfficientNetB7, NASNetMobile, and ConvNeXtSmall. We test these CNNs on the stated plant disease detection and classification problem, both independently and as part of an ensemble. In the final phase, a logistic regression (LR) classifier is utilized to determine the performance of various CNN model combinations. A comparative analysis was also performed on classifiers, deep learning, the proposed model, and similar state-of-the-art studies. The experiments demonstrated that PDDNet-AE and PDDNet-LVE achieved 96.74% and 97.79%, respectively, compared to current CNNs when tested on several plant diseases, depicting its exceptional robustness and generalization capabilities and mitigating current concerns in plant disease detection and classification.",

            "abstract": "Automatic and accurate estimation of disease severity is essential for food security, disease management, and yield loss prediction. Deep learning, the latest breakthrough in computer vision, is promising for fine-grained disease severity classification, as the method avoids the labor-intensive feature engineering and threshold-based segmentation. Using the apple black rot images in the PlantVillage dataset, which are further annotated by botanists with four severity stages as ground truth, a series of deep convolutional neural networks are trained to diagnose the severity of the disease. The performances of shallow networks trained from scratch and deep models fine-tuned by transfer learning are evaluated systemically in this paper. The best model is the deep VGG16 model trained with transfer learning, which yields an overall accuracy of 90.4% on the hold-out test set. The proposed deep learning model may have great potential in disease control for modern agriculture.",

The images of infected crop leaves were taken under different environments of the growth periods, temperature and humidity. The methods of image morphological operation, contour extraction and region growing algorithm were adopted for leaf image enhancement and spot image segmentation. From each image of infected crop leaf, the statistical features of color, texture and shape were extracted by image processing, and the optimal meteorological features with the highest accuracy rate were obtained and selected by the attribute reduction algorithm. The fusion feature vector of the image was formed by combining the statistical features and the meteorological features. Then the probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) classifier was adopted to evaluate the classification accuracy. The experimental results on three cucumber diseased leaf image datasets, i.e., downy mildew, blight and anthracnose, showed that the crop diseases can be effectively recognized by the integrated application of leaf image processing technology, the disease meteorological data and PNNs classifier, and the recognition accuracy rate was higher than 90%, which indicated that the PNNs classifier trained on the disease feature coefficients extracted from the crop disease leaves and meteorological data could achieve higher classification accuracy. \nKeywords: image processing, crop disease recognition, disease meteorological data, morphology, probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) \nDOI: 10.3965/j.ijabe.20150804.1719 \n \nCitation: Shi Y, Wang X F, Zhang S W, Zhang C L.

This paper presents a low shot learning method for tea leaf’s disease identification in order to prevent and control tea leaf’s diseases timely. By extracting the color and texture features, disease spots on tea leaf's disease images are segmented by using support vector machine (SVM) method. With segmented disease spot images as input, new training samples are generated by the improved conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (C-DCGAN) for data augmentation, which are used to train VGG16 deep learning model to identify the tea leaf's diseases. Experimental results show that, SVM can segment disease spot images on the condition of low shot learning while retaining the edge information well, improved C-DCGAN can generate augmented images with the same data distribution as real disease spot images, the VGG16 deep learning model trained with augmented disease spot images can identify tea leaf’s diseases accurately, and the average identification accuracy of the proposed method reaches 90%, far exceeding classical low shot learning methods.",

Many different feature extraction techniques are used by the researchers for leaf disease diagnosis which includes colour, shape, texture, HOG, SURF and SIFT features. Recently Deep Learning is giving very promising results in the field of computer vision. In this manuscript, two feature extraction techniques are discussed and compared. In first approach, the Gray Level Covariance Matrix(GLCM) is used which extracts 12 texture features for diagnosis purpose. In second appraoch, the pretrained deep learning model, Alexnet is used for feature extraction purpose. There are 1000 features extracted automatically with the help of this pretrained model. Here Backpropagation neural network (BPNN) is used for the classification purpose. It is observed that the deep learning features are more dominant as compared to the texture features. It gives 93.85% accuracy which is much better than the texture feature extraction technique used here. AMS subject classification:",

Eggplant (Solanum melongena) is one of the important crops, but it is susceptible to serious diseases which hinder its production. Surprisingly, so far no dataset is available for the diseases in this crop. The unavailability of the dataset for these diseases motivated the authors to create a standard dataset in laboratory and field conditions for five major diseases. Pre-trained Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) architecture has been used and the images have been converted to other color spaces namely Hue Saturation Value (HSV), YCbCr and grayscale for evaluation. Results show that the dataset created with RGB and YCbCr images in field condition was promising with a classification accuracy of 99.4%. The dataset also has been evaluated with other popular architectures and compared. In addition, VGG16 has been used as feature extractor from 8th convolution layer and these features have been used for classifying diseases employing Multi-Class Support Vector Machine (MSVM). The analysis depicted an equivalent or in some cases produced better accuracy. Possible reasons for variation in interclass accuracy and future direction have been discussed.",

These Nature inspired algorithm (NIA) or Bio-inspired methods have been espoused in the number of applications for finding an accurate solution working with real-time or complex data. Image segmentation is one of them. It is the practice of separating an image into its constituent subparts in order to extract some meaningful information from it. There are number of methods used for performing segmentation. In this paper our aim is in studying one of the optimization method named as Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA). This method is then used for initializing the weights for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that is deployed for image segmentation. Finally, when the results are compared with the other methods shows the efficiency BFO-ANN method.",

To solve these problems, a convolutional neural network identification model based on Inception module and dilated convolution is proposed in this study. The inception module combined with dilated convolution, could extract disease characteristics at different scales and increase the receptive field. By setting different parameters, six improved models were obtained. They were trained to identify 26 diseases of 14 different crops; then the authors selected optimal recognition model. On this basis, the segmented dataset and the grey-scaled dataset were trained as comparative experiments to explore the influence of background and colour features on the recognition results. After only two training epochs, the improved optimal model could achieve an accuracy of over 95%. Moreover, the final average identification accuracy reached 99.37%. Contrast experiments indicate that colour and background features may influence the recognition effect. The improved model can extract disease information from different scales in the feature map to identify diverse diseases of different crops. The proposed model has faster training speed and higher recognition accuracy than the traditional model, and thus it can provide a reference for crop disease identification in actual production.",

Plant disease may cause significant losses in food production and eradicate diversity in species. Early diagnosis of plant diseases using accurate or automatic detection techniques can enhance the quality of food production and minimize economic losses. In recent years, deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in the recognition accuracy of image classification and object detection systems. Hence, in this paper, we utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pre-trained models for efficient plant disease identification. We focused on fine tuning the hyperparameters of popular pre-trained models, such as DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4. The experiments were carried out using the popular PlantVillage dataset, which has 54,305 image samples of different plant disease species in 38 classes. The performance of the model was evaluated through classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. A comparative analysis was also performed with similar state-of-the-art studies. The experiments proved that DenseNet-121 achieved 99.81% higher classification accuracy, which was superior to state-of-the-art models.",

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved outstanding results in plant diseases. Furthermore, DNNs are very fragile, and adversarial attacks in image classification deserve much attention. It is important to detect the robustness of DNNs through adversarial attacks. The paper firstly improves the EfficientNet by adding the SimAM attention module. The SimAM-EfficientNet is proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the improved model on PlantVillage reaches 99.31%. The accuracy of ResNet50 is 98.33%. The accuracy of ResNet18 is 98.31%. The accuracy of DenseNet is 98.90%. In addition, the GP-MI-FGSM adversarial attack algorithm improved by gamma correction and image pyramid in this paper can increase the success rate of attack. The model proposed in this paper has an error rate of 87.6% whenattacked by the GP-MI-FGSM adversarial attack algorithm. The success rate of GP-MI-FGSM proposed in this paper is higher than other adversarial attack algorithms, including FGSM, I-FGSM, and MI-FGSM.",

Yet, experts think that technology can help farmers with plant disease detection. Researchers developed a system that enables farmers to easily upload a picture of a leaf and obtain details about it, such as whether it is healthy or, in the case that it is not alternative remedies. For this investigation, researchers used CNNs, a subset of ANNs.4,500 leaf photos from four different classes made up the training set for our CNN model. Single-leafed plants with a uniform background and no additional noise make up the Plant Village dataset. But, the photos in the real scenario may differ. Hence, to improve the outcome in both the simulation and the real world, employed the YOLO technique to calculate ROI and then fed that ROI into the CNN model, which predicted our outcome. The CNN model contains a total of 10 layers: 2 sequential layers (for input preprocessing and augmentation), three convolutional layers, three pooling levels, one layer that is fully connected, and one output layer with a Softmax activation function. Three sections of our dataset were created: training (60%) validation (20%) and testing (20%). In this research, training the model throughout 60 epochs. The model is proposed, created, and trained with its validation accuracy and results show 96% and its test accuracy was 93%.

Within pre-trained models, deep feature extractions have been obtained from connected layers. Deep features have been extracted and are sent to the LSTM layer to build a robust, enhanced LSTM-CNN model for detecting plant pests and diseases. Experiments were carried out using Turkey Dataset, with 4,447 apple pests and diseases categorized into 15 different classes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study has been evaluated in different CNNs using logistic regression (LR), LSTM, and extreme learning machine (ELM), focusing on plant disease detection problems. The ensemble majority voting (EMV) classifier was used at the LSTM layer to detect and classify plant disease labels. Furthermore, an autonomous selection of the optimal LSTM layer network parameters was applied. Finally, the performance was validated based on sensitivity, F1-score, accuracy, and specificity using LSTM, ELM, and LR classifiers.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe presented model attained 99.2% accuracy in comparison to the cutting-edge models on different classifiers like LSTM, LR, and ELM, and performed better in comparison to transfer learning (TL). Pre-trained models, like VGG-19, VGG-18, and AlexNet, demonstrated better accuracy when the fc6 layer was compared to other layers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

In traditional or conventional methods, identification and classification were done by testing in laboratories or through visual inspection by farmers. Now going through the testing in labs is very time consuming, while the visual inspection requires enough experience and knowledge. To solve this problem, our study proposes a robust plant pathogen detection method based on a Deep Learning approach on a large dataset containing about 38 categories of different species like Maize, Potatoes, Tomatoes, Bell Pepper, Peach, Strawberry etc. and diseases like rust, molds, blight (late and early). This crop disease detection model leverages the power of the EfficientNetB3 architecture, a state-of-art convolutional neural network(CNN). The main backbone is served by EfficientNetB3and then it is fine-tuned using different hyperparameters and other regularization techniques like weight decay, dropout method and optimizers like RAdam,to enhance the overall accuracy coupled with dynamic learning rate adjustment. In the testing set of the dataset, the proposed model shows encouraging accuracy of about 99.25%, high precision of about 97.35%. A thorough evaluation of the model’s functionality is given by the help of training and validation line chart and loss chart that gives the in-depth information on the prediction. And then we implemented the detection model in our mobile application whose interface screen shots are given below. In the application the image can be taken by camera or fed from folders and it will detect the type of disease.",

        "abstract": "The nation of India, with abundant biodiversity, must contend with the effects of climate change on ecosystems and habitats. The tomato, or Solanum lycopersicum, is a critically important fruit utilized extensively in Indian and Western cuisines. However, the tomato is a fruit that may contract illness because of pest infestations, bacterial activity, microbes, and changes in the climate. Given the necessity for mass production, which renders “hand-picking” unfeasible, automation of a tomato field would be crucial. This would necessitate innovative solutions for disease diagnosis and classification in a large-scale production. This study examines various approaches related to tomato iden-tification, emphasizing performance analysis. To detect pests and illnesses in crops, the suggested method includes an autonomous mobile robot fitted with sensors, such as RGB cameras and Ultrasonic Sensors enhanced with Wi-Fi-enabled data transfer for IoT technology. The RGB camera takes crop visuals in real time and uses image processing, deep learning techniques, and the YOLOv8 algorithm to identify disease symptoms. To make the suggested mobile robot, an effective and long-lasting instrument for disease management in agriculture Micro-ROS is used. Its ability to identify illnesses quickly reduces the environmental impact and guarantees food safety, which is a big step toward a sustainable agricultural future.",

Diseases are detrimental to the plant's health which in turn affects its growth. To ensure minimal losses to the cultivated crop, it is crucial to supervise its growth. There are numerous types of tomato diseases that target the crop's leaf at an alarming rate. This paper adopts a slight variation of the convolutional neural network model called LeNet to detect and identify diseases in tomato leaves. The main aim of the proposed work is to find a solution to the problem of tomato leaf disease detection using the simplest approach while making use of minimal computing resources to achieve results comparable to state of the art techniques. Neural network models employ automatic feature extraction to aid in the classification of the input image into respective disease classes. This proposed system has achieved an average accuracy of 94–95 % indicating the feasibility of the neural network approach even under unfavourable conditions.",

However, significant focus has already been dedicated to disease classification in crops. Additionally, the lack of spatial information for affected leaves persuades us to move towards an object detection approach, utilizing variants based on the YOLO framework. We illustrate results with a twin focus on accuracy and real-time inference. Through our work, we aim to assist the development of a mobile application for disease identification.",

            "abstract": "In a developing country like India agriculture plays a noteworthy role. Agricultural intervention in the livelihood of rural India indulges by about 58%. Among the agricultural products, tomato is one of the most used crops. Thus, preventing significant loss in quantity and yield of tomato is majorly dependent on recognition and classification of diseases a tomato plant might possess. Latest and fostering technologies like Image processing is used to rectify such issues using different types of techniques and algorithms. Initially, the leaves of a tomato plant get affected, when plant develops a particular type of disease. In this project, four consecutive stages are used to discover the type of disease. The four stages include pre-processing, leaf segmentation, feature extraction and classification. To remove the noise we are doing the pre-processing and to part the affected or damages area of the leaf, image segmentation is used. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which is a guided, supervised and advance machine learning algorithm, is implemented to find solutions for both the problems related to classification and regression. During the terminal stage, user is recommended with the treatment. Mostly live plants are adversely affected by the diseases. This paper imparts representation of leaf disease detection employing image processing that can identify drawbacks in tomato plant from images, based on color, bound and texture to give the brisk and reliable results to the farmer.",

The tropical climate is ideal for its growth, however certain climatic conditions and various other factors affect the normal growth of tomato plants. Apart from these climatic conditions and natural disasters, plant disease is a major crisis in crop production and results in economic loss. The traditional disease detection methods for tomato crops could not produce the expected outcome and the detection period for diseases was slow. The early detection of diseases can give better results than the existing detection models. Thus, computer vision-based technology deep learning techniques could be implemented for earlier disease detection. This paper introduces a comprehensive analysis of the disease classification and detection techniques implied for tomato leaf disease identification. This paper also reviews the merits and drawbacks of the methodologies proposed. This paper finally proposes the early disease detection technique to identify tomato leaf disease using hybrid deep-learning architecture.",

To perform fast and efficient detection of waste targets in the sorting process, this paper proposes a data augmentation + YOLO_EC waste detection system. First of all, because of the current shortage of multi-objective waste classification datasets, the heavy workload of human data collection, and the limited improvement of data features by traditional data augmentation methods, DCGAN (deep convolution generative adversarial networks) was optimized by improving the loss function, and an image-generation model was established to realize the generation of multi-objective waste images; secondly, with YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) as the basic model, EfficientNet is used as the backbone feature extraction network to realize the light weight of the algorithm, and at the same time, the CA (coordinate attention) attention mechanism is introduced to reconstruct the MBConv module to filter out high-quality information and enhance the feature extraction ability of the model. Experimental results show that on the HPU_WASTE dataset, the proposed model outperforms other models in both data augmentation and waste detection.",

In this study, an improved YOLOX-based tomato leaf disease identification method is designed. To address the issue of positive and negative sample imbalance, the sample adaptive cross-entropy loss function (LBCE−β) is proposed as a confidence loss, and MobileNetV3 is employed instead of the YOLOX backbone for lightweight model feature extraction. By introducing CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) between the YOLOX backbone and neck network, the model’s feature extraction performance is increased. CycleGAN is used to enhance the data of tomato disease leaf samples in the PlantVillage dataset, solving the issue of an imbalanced sample number. After data enhancement, simulation experiments and field tests revealed that the YOLOX’s accuracy improved by 1.27%, providing better detection of tomato leaf disease samples in complex environments. Compared with the original model, the improved YOLOX model occupies 35.34% less memory, model detection speed increases by 50.20%, and detection accuracy improves by 1.46%. The enhanced network model is quantized by TensorRT and works at 11.1 FPS on the Jetson Nano embedded device. This method can provide an efficient solution for the tomato leaf disease identification system.",

The tailed twist here is that those loss which farmers face can be actually reduced by the detection of those plant diseases at early. Manually doing the recognition can be whole tiresome, also the recognition done won't be always accurate as the two possible disease early blight & late blight are similar in state. To unmute such problems, we have devised our own customized CNN model also various strategies of Deep Learning (DL) & Convolution Neural Network (CNN) Sky-rocketed in recent times as they are helpful in accurate diagnosis in less amount of time & even combining these methods with Image processing, the images of different plant with its respective diseases are used to identify the plant diseases. Dataset for the current research was besotted from the Kaggle. Google cloud Functions is used for deployment and Fast API is used for testing purpose of our model. The web app interface which we had developed can take the input as an image & it will conclude whether the input provided of the plant leaf is healthy or not if it turns out to be the known disease it will show the plant with its respective disease & will provide the solution to set your plant disease free.

The rapid increase in the use of chemicals such as fungicides and bactericides to curtail plant diseases is causing negative effects on the agro-ecosystem. The high scale prevalence of diseases in crops affects the production quantity and quality. Solving the problem of early identification/diagnosis of diseases by exploiting a quick and consistent reliable method will benefit the farmers. In this context, our research work focuses on classification and identification of tomato leaf diseases using convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques. We consider four CNN architectures, namely, VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet, and Inception V3, and use feature extraction and parameter-tuning to identify and classify tomato leaf diseases. We test the underlying models on two datasets, a laboratory-based dataset and self-collected data from the field. We observe that all architectures perform better on the laboratory-based dataset than on field-based data, with performance on various metrics showing variance in the range 10%–15%. Inception V3 is identified as the best performing algorithm on both datasets.",

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",

            "abstract": "With rich annotation information, object detection-based automated plant disease diagnosis systems (e.g., YOLO-based systems) often provide advantages over classification-based systems (e.g., EfficientNet-based), such as the ability to detect disease locations and superior classification performance. One drawback of these detection systems is dealing with unannotated healthy data with no real symptoms present. In practice, healthy plant data appear to be very similar to many disease data. Thus, those models often produce mis-detected boxes on healthy images. In addition, labeling new data for detection models is typically time-consuming. Hard-sample mining (HSM) is a common technique for re-training a model by using the mis-detected boxes as new training samples. However, blindly selecting an arbitrary amount of hard-sample for re-training will result in the degradation of diagnostic performance for other diseases due to the high similarity between disease and healthy data. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective training strategy called hard-sample re-mining (HSReM), which is designed to enhance the diagnostic performance of healthy data and simultaneously improve the performance of disease data by strategically selecting hard-sample training images at an appropriate level. Experiments based on two practical in-field eight-class cucumber and ten-class tomato datasets (42.7K and 35.6K images) show that our HSReM training strategy leads to a substantial improvement in the overall diagnostic performance on large-scale unseen data. Specifically, the object detection model trained using the HSReM strategy not only achieved superior results as compared to the classification-based state-of-the-art EfficientNetV2-Large model and the original object detection model, but also outperformed the model using the HSM strategy in multiple evaluation metrics.",

However, challenges such as plant diseases pose threats to food security and biodiversity. Early disease diagnosis is crucial to address these risks. While traditional methods involve manual plant inspection by farmers, technological advancements offer faster solutions. Scientists leverage computers and machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze plant images for disease identification, focusing on attributes like leaf shape and color. This approach is adaptable to mobile devices and employs various ML techniques, including random forest, nearest neighbours, linear regression, Naive Bayes, neural networks, and support vector machine (SVM).

An ensemble plant disease risk model is proposed and evaluated employing unbiased criteria such as true positive and negative rate, recall, precision, and F1-score. Results highlight the superiority of the ensemble model over other plant disease detection methods, achieving the objective of enhancing disease prediction in agriculture. The use of the random forest technique specifically works well for identifying leaf diseases from photos that have been taken, with the Random Forest Classifier achieving an astounding 97.81% accuracy rate. These encouraging results outperform current cutting-edge models and suggest the possibility of averting significant crop losses.",

In fact, efficiency is higher if selective treatment is performed for each type of infestation instead of using a broadcast herbicide on the whole surface. This work proposes a strategy where weeds are characterised by a set of shape descriptors (the seven Hu moments and six geometric shape descriptors). Weeds appear in outdoor field images which display real situations obtained from a RGB camera. Thus, images present a mixture of both weed species under varying conditions of lighting. In the presented approach, four decision-making methods were adapted to use the best shape descriptors as attributes and a choice was taken. This proposal establishes a novel methodology with a high success rate in weed species discrimination.",

Our proposed paper includes various phases of implementation namely dataset creation, feature extraction, training the classifier and classification. The created datasets of diseased and healthy leaves are collectively trained under Random Forest to classify the diseased and healthy images.

Next we examine productivity more closely and the evidence that the global rate of agricultural productivity growth is declining?with potentially serious prospects for the price and availability of food for the poorest people in the world.

Leaf-based plant species recognition research is important and challenging due to the large within-class difference and between-class similarity of leaves and the rich inconsistent leaves with different sizes, colors, shapes, textures, and venations. Most existing plant leaf recognition methods typically normalize all leaf images to the same size and then recognize them at one scale, which results in unsatisfactory performances. A novel multiscale convolutional neural network with attention (AMSCNN) model is constructed for plant species recognition. In AMSCNN, multiscale convolution is used to learn the low-frequency and high-frequency features of the input images, and an attention mechanism is utilized to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature extraction and improving network training. Extensive experiments on the plant leaf dataset demonstrate the remarkable performance of AMSCNN compared with the hand-crafted feature-based methods and deep-neural network-based methods. The maximum accuracy attained along with AMSCNN is 95.28%.",

            "abstract": "Plant diseases are one of the grand challenges that face the agriculture sector worldwide. In the United States, crop diseases cause losses of one-third of crop production annually. Despite the importance, crop disease diagnosis is challenging for limited-resources farmers if performed through optical observation of plant leaves’ symptoms. Therefore, there is an urgent need for markedly improved detection, monitoring, and prediction of crop diseases to reduce crop agriculture losses. Computer vision empowered with Machine Learning (ML) has tremendous promise for improving crop monitoring at scale in this context. This paper presents an ML-powered mobile-based system to automate the plant leaf disease diagnosis process. The developed system uses Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) as an underlying deep learning engine for classifying 38 disease categories. We collected an imagery dataset containing 96,206 images of plant leaves of healthy and infected plants for training, validating, and testing the CNN model. The user interface is developed as an Android mobile app, allowing farmers to capture a photo of the infected plant leaves. It then displays the disease category along with the confidence percentage. It is expected that this system would create a better opportunity for farmers to keep their crops healthy and eliminate the use of wrong fertilizers that could stress the plants. Finally, we evaluated our system using various performance metrics such as classification accuracy and processing time. We found that our model achieves an overall classification accuracy of 94% in recognizing the most common 38 disease classes in 14 crop species.",

        "abstract": ": Enabling visual plant disease diagnosis through deep learning that analyses big data is essential to diagnose diseases quickly. It helps the farmers and enables them to treat early, reducing the crop losses needed for a sustainable increase in agriculture. Farmers’ losses were also reduced using these technologies. However, deep learning still has great potential for plant disease diagnosis, though many challenges are associated with it. For example, it requires large, annotated data sets of symptoms and processing resources. This study proposes a novel Cloud-based Image Annotation Plant Disease Detection (C-IAPDD), which employs cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Vision API for image annotation and plant disease detection. Instead of creating such datasets manually or using those non-annotated ones saved by farmers onto their mobile phones since sensors in the device can detect disease on a particular leaf whenever placed close to it. The proposed solution provides a connection to the Internet and offline as well. The ability of C-IAPDD to simplify large-scale envision dataset collection and annotation enables powerful deep-learning models. Using cloud infrastructure’s processing power and scalability makes this a highly efficient method of identifying plant diseases without compromising accuracy. Several simulation experiments have proved that C-IAPDD could recognize a wide range of plant diseases across different types of crops. This simulation shows that C-IAPDD performs better than other methods in precision, swiftness, and expandability. The results indicate that C-IAPDD may improve plant disease detection and control, leading to healthier harvests. These findings endorse I-CIAPDD for artificial intelligence in agriculture.",

Due to the substantial population growth, meeting people’s dietary needs has become a relevant concern. The transition to smart agriculture has become inevitable to achieve these food security goals. In recent years, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), have been intensely researched and applied in various fields, including agriculture. This study analyzed the recent research articles on deep learning techniques in agriculture over the previous five years and discussed the most important contributions and the challenges that have been solved. Furthermore, we investigated the agriculture parameters being monitored by the internet of things and used them to feed the deep learning algorithm for analysis. Additionally, we compared different studies regarding focused agriculture area, problems solved, the dataset used, the deep learning model used, the framework used, data preprocessing and augmentation method, and results with accuracy. We concluded in this survey that although CNN provides better results, it lacks in early detection of plant diseases. To cope with this issue, we proposed an intelligent agriculture system based on a hybrid model of CNN and SVM, capable of detecting and classifying plant leaves disease early.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is important for the survival of humanity since about 70% of the world's population is engaged in agricultural pursuits to varying degrees. The previous and present methodology lacks ways to identify diseases in different crops within an agricultural environment. The crops most impacted by these illnesses are tomatoes, leading to a significant increase in the price of tomatoes. Controlling tomato illnesses is crucial for optimal development and production, making early diagnosis and disease detection vital. Early disease diagnosis and treatment in tomato plants can lead to improved yields. Tomato plants are susceptible to illnesses, which can significantly affect the quality, quantity, and productivity of the crop if not properly treated. Despite many unsuccessful efforts to utilize machine learning methods for detecting and classifying illnesses in tomato plants. This study introduces a comparative framework for segmenting tomato leaf regions using both conventional and swarm intelligence methodologies to determine the more effective approach. This framework enables the development of a tomato plant diagnosis system capable of analyzing various sorts of images, including both standard and custom image datasets. The obtained evaluation parameters of the proposed model in terms of average precision, recall, f-measure, error, and accuracy are 0.914, 0.915, 0.915, 1.55% and 98.45%, respectively. We performed a comparative examination of six scenarios: T-model, K-model, TPSO-model, KPSO-model, TGO-model, and KGO-model. The combination of K-means with the GO algorithm proved to be a powerful hybrid technique, with an accuracy of 96.45%. Comparatively, the T-model, K-model, TPSO-model, KPSO-model, and TGO-model attained accuracies of 85.73%, 86.61%, 87.54%, 88.64%, and 92.21% correspondingly.",

We used ResNet50 architecture for accurate results. The ResNet architecture is a cutting-edge deep neural network. This is the most preferred approach towards deep learning. Here, complicated images are taken into consideration. The vanishing gradient problem is resolved, resulting in better performance. Our study used the PlantVillage dataset with 15 folders of varieties of diseases and their labels. The experimental results were clear, showing that our approach to the model was efficient in detection of the diseases within the plants at an accuracy of 99.71%, outperforming other deep learning models.

It uses leaf image classification with the help of deep convolutional networks. In this paper, VGG16 and Resnet34 CNN was proposed to detect the plant disease. It has three processing steps namely feature extraction, downsizing image and classification. In CNN, the convolutional layer extracts the feature from plant image. The pooling layer downsizing the image. The disease classification was done in dense layer. The proposed model can recognize 38 differing types of plant diseases out of 14 different plants with the power to differentiate plant leaves from their surroundings. The performance of VGG16 and Resnet34 was compared.  The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity was taken as performance Metrix.

To eliminate the disease-induced losses in plants during growth as well as to increase crop productivity, former disease detection and prevention on the crop are the most challenging factors. Thus, it is a suitable decision that can be taken by the farmers or villagers to avoid further losses. The project works on the technique of image processing which identifies the various diseases in plants. Here we use an efficient convolutional neural network algorithm (CNN) algorithm which can detect the type of diseases in various leaves. Our proposed paper includes implementation steps like datasets gathering, training, segmentation, feature extraction, testing, classification, using CNN to classify the leaves which are diseased or healthy based on data. This work implemented in giving the input leaf in real-time from the source of Google or dataset is trained under the system helps in disease detection and represents remedies for overcoming the deficiency.

            "abstract": "—Agriculture and modern farming is one of the fields where IoT and automation can have a great impact. Maintaining healthy plants and monitoring their environment in order to identify or detect diseases is essential in order to maintain a maximum crop yield. The implementation of current high rocketing technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning has proved to be extremely important in modern agriculture as a method of advanced image analysis domain. Artificial intelligence adds time efficiency and the possibility of identifying plant diseases, in addition to monitoring and controlling the environmental conditions in farms. Several studies showed that machine learning and deep learning technologies can detect plant diseases upon analyzing plant leaves with great accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, considering the worth of machine learning for disease detection, we present a convolutional neural network VGG-16 model to detect plant diseases, to allow farmers to make timely actions with respect to treatment without further delay. To carry this out, 19 different classes of plants diseases were chosen, where 15,915 plant leaf images (both diseased and healthy leaves) were acquired from the Plant Village dataset for training and testing. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model is able to achieve an accuracy of about 95.2% with the testing loss being only 0.4418. The proposed model provides a clear direction toward a deep learning-based plant disease detection to apply on a large scale in future.",

        "abstract": "A country’s economy is influenced by a wide range of factors, with the agriculture, service, and food processing sectors. In our country, agriculture is one of the most significant economic sectors. The agriculture sector, however, has several difficulties, such as the different climatic conditions in other regions of our country that give rise to various infectious diseases in different plant species, resulting in a significant drop in crop productivity and income generation. Early and accurate plant disease diagnosis is crucial in improving the foundation for harvest formation. The traditional method of plant disease detection through eye observation is unsuccessful since it necessitates knowledge. Machine learning (ML) techniques are being utilized to identify and categorize plant ailments to address this issue. In this work, plant diseases can be classified using machine learning methods. These involve classifier training, classification, and stages like dataset construction, image loading, pre-processing, segmentation, and feature extraction. An artificial neural network is initially used to distinguish and find leaves in a challenging environment. The Chan-Vese (CV) technique states that symptoms can be found in images that have been segmented depending on the outcomes of the ANN algorithm. A transfer learning model trained on a dataset of ill leaves on an essential background is then given the segmented leaves. The model is also checked for rust, black rot, and bacterial plaque conditions. The findings demonstrate that the methodology is more accurate—98.22%—than the previous approach, minimizing the adverse effects of illness on agricultural productivity and promoting long-term agrarian growth. Utilizing data from PlantVillage, the model is trained and validated. The dataset includes images of plant diseases afflicting pepper, tomato, and potato plants. Fifteen different plant disease categories are used to train and evaluate the classifier. The results of the trials show that the proposed ANNCVA deep learning model can categorize the numerous varieties of plant leaves accurately and effectively.",

However, a limited number of studies have elucidated the process of inference, leaving it as an untouchable black box. Revealing the CNN to extract the learned feature as an interpretable form not only ensures its reliability but also enables the validation of the model authenticity and the training dataset by human intervention. In this study, a variety of neuron-wise and layer-wise visualization methods were applied using a CNN, trained with a publicly available plant disease image dataset. We showed that neural networks can capture the colors and textures of lesions specific to respective diseases upon diagnosis, which resembles human decision-making. While several visualization methods were used as they are, others had to be optimized to target a specific layer that fully captures the features to generate consequential outputs. Moreover, by interpreting the generated attention maps, we identified several layers that were not contributing to inference and removed such layers inside the network, decreasing the number of parameters by 75% without affecting the classification accuracy. The results provide an impetus for the CNN black box users in the field of plant science to better understand the diagnosis process and lead to further efficient use of deep learning for plant disease diagnosis.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. To achieve high yield of crops and to avoid pesticide abuse, different control methods have been adopted according to different degrees of disease in crop plants. To address the issue, a leaf disease grade identification method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed. First, nonuniform illumination images were processed using an adaptive adjustment algorithm based on a two-dimensional (2-D) gamma function. Then a threshold segmentation method was used to segment diseased leaf images and thus to obtain binary images. Next, the ratio of the number of pixels in the lesion area to that in the diseased leaf area was calculated. This ratio was regarded as the classification threshold of the disease grades, and therefore was used to determine the disease grade category. In addition, use of a ResNet50-based CNN was proposed to identify disease grades, with a focal loss function replacing the standard cross entropy loss function, and with the Adam optimization method. Finally, leaf disease grade identification was performed on a database containing 10 types of disease leaf images for 8 crops, and it yielded a recognition accuracy of 95.61%. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was feasible and effective for the classification of leaf disease grades.",

            "abstract": "Anthracnose, brown spot, mites, black rot, downy mildew, and leaf blight are six common grape leaf pests and diseases, which cause severe economic losses to the grape industry. Timely diagnosis and accurate identification of grape leaf diseases are decisive for controlling the spread of disease and ensuring the healthy development of the grape industry. This paper proposes a novel recognition approach that is based on improved convolutional neural networks for the diagnoses of grape leaf diseases. First, based on 4,023 images collected in the field and 3,646 images collected from public data sets, a data set of 107,366 grape leaf images is generated via image enhancement techniques. Afterward, Inception structure is applied for strengthening the performance of multi-dimensional feature extraction. In addition, a dense connectivity strategy is introduced to encourage feature reuse and strengthen feature propagation. Ultimately, a novel CNN-based model, namely, DICNN, is built and trained from scratch. It realizes an overall accuracy of 97.22% under the hold-out test set. Compared to GoogLeNet and ResNet-34, the recognition accuracy increases by 2.97% and 2.55%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently recognize grape leaf diseases. Meanwhile, this study explores a new approach for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases that establishes a theoretical foundation for the application of deep learning in the field of agricultural information.",

It also has the poorest rate of survival and comes in a variety of shapes, textures, and sizes, depending on where it is found. Bad things will happen if the tumour brain is misclassified. As a reason, early detection of the right kind and grade of tumour is critical in determining the best treatment strategy. Brain tumours may be identified by looking at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pictures of the patient’s brain. The manual method becomes time-consuming and may lead to human mistakes due to the huge quantities of data and the different kinds of brain tumours. As a result, a computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) system is needed. Image categorization methods have advanced significantly in recent years, particularly deep learning networks, which have achieved success in this field. In this case, we used a multilayer stacked probabilistic belief network to accurately classify brain tumors. Here the MRI brain images are Pre-processed using the Hybrid Butter worth Anisotropic filter and contrast Blow up Histogram Equalization. Followed by pre-processing, the denoised image can be segmented by using the bounding box U-NET segmentation methodology. Then after segmenting the target, the specialized features regarding the tumor can be extracted using the In-depth atom embedding method. Then they obtained can reduce feature dimensionality by using the Backward feature eliminating green wing optimization. The extracted features can be given as input for the classification process. A Multilayer stacked probabilistic belief network is then used to classify the tumour as malignant or benign. The suggested system’s efficacy was tested on the BraTS dataset, which yielded a high level of accuracy. Subjective comparison study is also performed out among the suggested technique and certain state-of-the-art methods, according to the work presented. Experiments show that the proposed system outperforms current methods in terms of assisting radiologists in identifying the size, shape, and location of tumors in the human brain.",

            "abstract": "An abnormal growth of cells in the brain, often known as a brain tumor, has the potential to develop into cancer. Carcinogenesis of glial cells in the brain and spinal cord is the root cause of gliomas, which are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumor. After receiving a diagnosis of glioblastoma, it is anticipated that the average patient will have a survival time of less than 14 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-known non-invasive imaging technology that can detect brain tumors and gives a variety of tissue contrasts in each imaging modality. Until recently, only neuroradiologists were capable of performing the tedious and time-consuming task of manually segmenting and analyzing structural MRI scans of brain tumors. This was because neuroradiologists have specialized training in this area. The development of comprehensive and automatic segmentation methods for brain tumors will have a significant impact on both the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. It is now possible to recognize tumors in photographs because of developments in computer-aided design (CAD), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. The purpose of this study is to develop, through the application of MRI data, an automated model for the detection and classification of brain tumors based on deep learning (DLBTDC-MRI). Using the DLBTDC-MRI method, brain tumors can be detected and characterized at various stages of their progression. Preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification are all included in the DLBTDC-MRI methodology that is supplied. The use of adaptive fuzzy filtering, often known as AFF, as a preprocessing technique for photos, results in less noise and higher-quality MRI scans. A method referred to as “chicken swarm optimization” (CSO) was used to segment MRI images. This method utilizes Tsallis entropy-based image segmentation to locate parts of the brain that have been injured. In addition to this, a Residual Network (ResNet) that combines handcrafted features with deep features was used to produce a meaningful collection of feature vectors. A classifier developed by combining DLBTDC-MRI and CSO can finally be used to diagnose brain tumors. To assess the enhanced performance of brain tumor categorization, a large number of simulations were run on the BRATS 2015 dataset. It would appear, based on the findings of these trials, that the DLBTDC-MRI method is superior to other contemporary procedures in many respects.",

The construction of large and publicly available datasets containing labeled images of healthy and diseased crop plants led to growing interest in computer vision techniques for automatic plant disease diagnosis. Although supervised image classifiers based on deep learning can be a powerful tool for plant disease diagnosis, they require a huge amount of labeled data. The data mining technique of anomaly detection includes unsupervised approaches that do not require rare samples for training classifiers. We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection technique for image-based plant disease diagnosis that is based on the reconstructability of colors; a deep encoder-decoder network trained to reconstruct the colors of \\textit{healthy} plant images should fail to reconstruct colors of symptomatic regions. Our proposed method includes a new image-based framework for plant disease detection that utilizes a conditional adversarial network called pix2pix and a new anomaly score based on CIEDE2000 color difference. Experiments with PlantVillage dataset demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method compared to an existing anomaly detector at identifying diseased crop images in terms of accuracy, interpretability and computational efficiency.",

However, it is limited in this regard by being sensitive to gross perturbations of the input, and by seeking a linear subspace that captures normal behaviour. The first issue has been dealt with by robust PCA, a variant of PCA that explicitly allows for some data points to be arbitrarily corrupted, however, this does not resolve the second issue, and indeed introduces the new issue that one can no longer inductively find anomalies on a test set. This paper addresses both issues in a single model, the robust autoencoder. This method learns a nonlinear subspace that captures the majority of data points, while allowing for some data to have arbitrary corruption. The model is simple to train and leverages recent advances in the optimisation of deep neural networks. Experiments on a range of real-world datasets highlight the model's effectiveness.",

Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator. We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson X2 divergence. There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process. We evaluate LSGANs on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs. We also conduct two comparison experiments between LSGANs and regular GANs to illustrate the stability of LSGANs.",

In order to solve such problems, methods based on machine learning can be used. In recent years, deep learning, which is especially widely used in image processing, offers many new applications related to precision agriculture. In this study, we evaluated the performance results using different approaches of nine powerful architectures of deep neural networks for plant disease detection. Transfer learning and deep feature extraction methods are used, which adapt these deep learning models to the problem at hand. The utilized pretrained deep models are considered in the presented work for feature extraction and for further fine-tuning. The obtained features using deep feature extraction are then classified by support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) methods. The experiments are carried out using data consisting of real disease and pest images from Turkey. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score are all calculated for performance evaluation. The evaluation results show that deep feature extraction and SVM/ELM classification produced better results than transfer learning. In addition, the fc6 layers of the AlexNet, VGG16, and VGG19 models produced better accuracy scores when compared to the other layers.",

One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits to combining Inception architectures with residual connections? Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08% top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge.\n \n",

            "abstract": "Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet). \nThe SqueezeNet architecture is available for download here: this https URL",

The proposed CNN architecture exhibits a much reduced design complexity when compared with other CNN solutions applied in pattern recognition. The number of processing layers in the CNN is reduced to only four by fusing the convolutional and subsampling layers. Unlike in conventional CNNs, we replace the convolution operation with cross-correlation, hence reducing the computational load. The network is trained using a second-order backpropagation learning algorithm with annealed global learning rates. Performance evaluation of the proposed CNN solution is conducted on two publicly available face databases of SUMS and AT&T. We achieve classification accuracies of 98.75% and 99.38% on the SUMS and AT&T databases, respectively. The neural network is able to process and classify a 32 × 32 pixel face image in less than 0.27 ms, which corresponds to a very high throughput of over 3700 images per second. Training converges within less than 20 epochs. These results correspond to a superior classification performance, verifying that the proposed CNN is an effective real-time solution for gender recognition.",

By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated outstanding performances in agriculture production. Agriculture production is one of the most important sectors because it has a direct impact on the economy and social life of any society. Plant disease identification is a big challenge for agriculture production, for which we need a fast and accurate technique to identify plant disease. With the recent advancement in deep learning, we can develop a robust and accurate system. This research investigated the use of deep learning for accurate and fast tomato plant disease identification. In this research, we have used individual and merged datasets of tomato plants with 10 diseases (including healthy plants). The main aim of this work is to check the accuracy of the existing convolutional neural network models such as Visual Geometry Group, Residual Net, and DenseNet on tomato plant disease detection and then design a custom deep neural network model to give the best accuracy in case of the tomato plant. We have trained and tested our models with datasets containing over 18,000 and 25,000 images with 10 classes. We achieved over 99% accuracy with our custom model. This high accuracy was achieved with less training time and lower computational cost compared to other CNNs. This research demonstrates the potential of deep learning for efficient and accurate tomato plant disease detection, which can benefit farmers and contribute to improved agricultural production. The custom model’s efficient performance makes it promising for practical implementation in real-world agricultural settings.",

Having been successfully applied in various areas, it has recently also entered the domain of agriculture. In the current paper, a survey was conducted of research efforts that employ convolutional neural networks (CNN), which constitute a specific class of DL, applied to various agricultural and food production challenges. The paper examines agricultural problems under study, models employed, sources of data used and the overall precision achieved according to the performance metrics used by the authors. Convolutional neural networks are compared with other existing techniques, and the advantages and disadvantages of using CNN in agriculture are listed. Moreover, the future potential of this technique is discussed, together with the authors’ personal experiences after employing CNN to approximate a problem of identifying missing vegetation from a sugar cane plantation in Costa Rica. The overall findings indicate that CNN constitutes a promising technique with high performance in terms of precision and classification accuracy, outperforming existing commonly used image-processing techniques. However, the success of each CNN model is highly dependent on the quality of the data set used.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture has becomes an immense area of research and is ascertained as a key element in the area of computer vision. In the agriculture field, image processing acts as a primary part. Cucumber is an important vegetable and its production in Pakistan is higher as compared to the other vegetables because of its use in salads. However, the diseases of cucumber such as Angular leaf spot, Anthracnose, blight, Downy mildew, and powdery mildew widely decrease the quality and quantity. Lately, numerous methods have been proposed for the identification and classification of diseases. Early detection and then treatment of the diseases in plants is important to prevent the crop from a disastrous decrease in yields. Many classification techniques have been proposed but still, they are facing some challenges such as noise, redundant features, and extraction of relevant features. In this work, an automated framework is proposed using deep learning and best feature selection for cucumber leaf diseases classification. In the proposed framework, initially, an augmentation technique is applied to the original images by creating more training data from existing samples and handling the problem of the imbalanced dataset. Then two different phases are utilized. In the first phase, fine-tuned four pre-trained models and select the best of them based on the accuracy. Features are extracted from the selected fine-tuned model and refined through the Entropy-ELM technique. In the second phase, fused the features of all four fine-tuned models and apply the Entropy-ELM technique, and finally fused with phase 1 selected feature. Finally, the fused features are recognized using machine learning classifiers for the final classification. The experimental process is conducted on five different datasets. On these datasets, the best-achieved accuracy is 98.4%. The proposed framework is evaluated on each step and also compared with some recent techniques. The comparison with some recent techniques showed that the proposed method obtained an improved performance.",

Plant disease detection and classification is a much-developed research area due to enormous development in machine learning (ML). Over the last ten years, computer vision researchers proposed different algorithms for plant disease identification using ML. This paper proposes an end-to-end semantic leaf segmentation model for plant disease identification. Our model uses a deep convolutional neural network based on semantic segmentation (SS). The proposed algorithm highlights diseased and healthy parts and allows the classification of ten different diseases affecting a specific plant leaf. The model successfully highlights the foreground (leaf) and background (nonleaf) regions through SS, identifying regions as healthy and diseased parts. As the semantic label is provided by the proposed method for each pixel, the information about how much area of a specific leaf is affected due to a disease is also estimated. We use tomato plant leaves as a test case in our work. We test the proposed CNN-based model on the publicly available database, PlantVillage. Along with PlantVillage, we also collected a dataset of twenty thousand images and tested our framework on it. Our proposed model obtained an average accuracy of 97.6%, which shows substantial improvement in performance on the same dataset compared to previous results.",

        "title": "Hierarchical Object Detection and Recognition Framework for Practical Plant Disease Diagnosis",
        "abstract": "Recently, object detection methods (OD; e.g., YOLO-based models) have been widely utilized in plant disease diagnosis. These methods demonstrate robustness to distance variations and excel at detecting small lesions compared to classification methods (CL; e.g., CNN models). However, there are issues such as low diagnostic performance for hard-to-detect diseases and high labeling costs. Additionally, since healthy cases cannot be explicitly trained, there is a risk of false positives. We propose the Hierarchical object detection and recognition framework (HODRF), a sophisticated and highly integrated two-stage system that combines the strengths of both OD and CL for plant disease diagnosis. In the first stage, HODRF uses OD to identify regions of interest (ROIs) without specifying the disease. In the second stage, CL diagnoses diseases surrounding the ROIs. HODRF offers several advantages: (1) Since OD detects only one type of ROI, HODRF can detect diseases with limited training images by leveraging its ability to identify other lesions. (2) While OD over-detects healthy cases, HODRF significantly reduces these errors by using CL in the second stage. (3) CL's accuracy improves in HODRF as it identifies diagnostic targets given as ROIs, making it less vulnerable to size changes. (4) HODRF benefits from CL's lower annotation costs, allowing it to learn from a larger number of images. We implemented HODRF using YOLOv7 for OD and EfficientNetV2 for CL and evaluated its performance on a large-scale dataset (4 crops, 20 diseased and healthy classes, 281K images). HODRF outperformed YOLOv7 alone by 5.8 to 21.5 points on healthy data and 0.6 to 7.5 points on macro F1 scores, and it improved macro F1 by 1.1 to 7.2 points over EfficientNetV2.",

            "abstract": "We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For $300\\times 300$ input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for $500\\times 500$ input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

However, due to the model capacity required to capture such representations, they are often susceptible to overfitting and therefore require proper regularization in order to generalize well.

Not only is this method extremely easy to implement, but we also demonstrate that it can be used in conjunction with existing forms of data augmentation and other regularizers to further improve model performance. We evaluate this method by applying it to current state-of-the-art architectures on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets, yielding new state-of-the-art results of 2.56%, 15.20%, and 1.30% test error respectively.

However, developing automated systems for disease diagnosis is often difficult, because labeling a reliable wide-angle disease dataset from actual field images is very laborious. In addition, the potential similarities between the training and test data lead to a serious problem of model overfitting. In this paper, we investigate changes in performance when applying disease diagnosis systems to different scenarios involving wide-angle cucumber test data captured on real farms, and propose an effective diagnostic strategy. We show that leading object recognition techniques such as SSD and Faster R-CNN achieve excellent end-to-end disease diagnostic performance only for a test dataset that is collected from the same population as the training dataset (with F1-score of 81.5% – 84.1% for diagnosed cases of disease), but their performance markedly deteriorates for a completely different test dataset (with F1-score of 4.4 – 6.2%). In contrast, our proposed two-stage systems using independent leaf detection and leaf diagnosis stages attain a promising disease diagnostic performance that is more than six times higher than end-to-end systems (with F1-score of 33.4 – 38.9%) on an unseen target dataset. We also confirm the efficiency of our proposal based on visual assessment, concluding that a two-stage model is a suitable and reasonable choice for practical applications.",

            "abstract": "In image-based plant diagnosis, clues related to diagnosis are often unclear, and the other factors such as image backgrounds often have a significant impact on the final decision. As a result, overfitting due to latent similarities in the dataset often occurs, and the diagnostic performance on real unseen data (e,g. images from other farms) is usually dropped significantly. However, this problem has not been sufficiently explored, since many systems have shown excellent diagnostic performance due to the bias caused by the similarities in the dataset. In this study, we investigate this problem with experiments using more than 50,000 images of cucumber leaves, and propose an anti-overfitting pretreatment (AOP) for realizing practical image-based plant diagnosis systems. The AOP detects the area of interest (leaf, fruit etc.) and performs brightness calibration as a preprocessing step. The experimental results demonstrate that our AOP can improve the accuracy of diagnosis for unknown test images from different farms by 12.2% in a practical setting.",

            "abstract": "—X-ray examination is suitable for screening of gastric cancer. Compared to endoscopy, which can only be performed by doctors, X-ray imaging can also be performed by radiographers, and thus, can treat more patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy of gastric radiographs is as low as 85%. To address this problem, highly accurate and quantitative automated diagnosis using machine learning needs to be performed. This paper proposes a diagnostic support method for detecting gastric cancer sites from X-ray images with high accuracy. The two new technical proposal of the method are (1) stochastic functional gastric image augmentation (sfGAIA), and (2) hard boundary box training (HBBT). The former is a probabilistic enhancement of gastric folds in X-ray images based on medical knowledge, whereas the latter is a recursive retraining technique to reduce false positives. We use 4,724 gastric radiographs of 145 patients in clinical practice and evaluate the cancer detection performance of the method in a patient-based ﬁve-group cross-validation. The proposed sfGAIA and HBBT signiﬁcantly enhance the performance of the EfﬁcientDet-D7 network by 5.9% in terms of the F1-score, and our screening method reaches a practical screening capability for gastric cancer (F1: 57.8%, recall: 90.2%, precision: 42.5%).",

            "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning have brought significant improvements to plant disease recognition. However, achieving satisfactory performance often requires high-quality training datasets, which are challenging and expensive to collect. Consequently, the practical application of current deep learning–based methods in real-world scenarios is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we argue that embracing poor datasets is viable and aims to explicitly define the challenges associated with using these datasets. To delve into this topic, we analyze the characteristics of high-quality datasets, namely, large-scale images and desired annotation, and contrast them with the limited and imperfect nature of poor datasets. Challenges arise when the training datasets deviate from these characteristics. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we propose a novel and informative taxonomy that categorizes these challenges. Furthermore, we offer a brief overview of existing studies and approaches that address these challenges. We point out that our paper sheds light on the importance of embracing poor datasets, enhances the understanding of the associated challenges, and contributes to the ambitious objective of deploying deep learning in real-world applications. To facilitate the progress, we finally describe several outstanding questions and point out potential future directions. Although our primary focus is on plant disease recognition, we emphasize that the principles of embracing and analyzing poor datasets are applicable to a wider range of domains, including agriculture.

            "abstract": "With rich annotation information, object detection-based automated plant disease diagnosis systems (e.g., YOLO-based systems) often provide advantages over classification-based systems (e.g., EfficientNet-based), such as the ability to detect disease locations and superior classification performance. One drawback of these detection systems is dealing with unannotated healthy data with no real symptoms present. In practice, healthy plant data appear to be very similar to many disease data. Thus, those models often produce mis-detected boxes on healthy images. In addition, labeling new data for detection models is typically time-consuming. Hard-sample mining (HSM) is a common technique for re-training a model by using the mis-detected boxes as new training samples. However, blindly selecting an arbitrary amount of hard-sample for re-training will result in the degradation of diagnostic performance for other diseases due to the high similarity between disease and healthy data. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective training strategy called hard-sample re-mining (HSReM), which is designed to enhance the diagnostic performance of healthy data and simultaneously improve the performance of disease data by strategically selecting hard-sample training images at an appropriate level. Experiments based on two practical in-field eight-class cucumber and ten-class tomato datasets (42.7K and 35.6K images) show that our HSReM training strategy leads to a substantial improvement in the overall diagnostic performance on large-scale unseen data. Specifically, the object detection model trained using the HSReM strategy not only achieved superior results as compared to the classification-based state-of-the-art EfficientNetV2-Large model and the original object detection model, but also outperformed the model using the HSM strategy in multiple evaluation metrics.",

        "abstract": "— Plant disease diagnosis is very critical for agricul- ture due to its importance for increasing crop production. Recent advances in image processing offer us a new way to solve this issue via visual plant disease analysis. However, there are few works in this area, not to mention systematic researches. In this paper, we systematically investigate the problem of visual plant disease recognition for plant disease diagnosis. Compared with other types of images, plant disease images generally exhibit randomly distributed lesions, diverse symptoms and complex backgrounds, and thus are hard to capture discriminative information. To facil- itate the plant disease recognition research, we construct a new large-scale plant disease dataset with 271 plant disease categories and 220,592 images. Based on this dataset, we tackle plant disease recognition via reweighting both visual regions and loss to emphasize diseased parts. We first compute the weights of all the divided patches from each image based on the cluster distribution of these patches to indicate the discriminative level of each patch. Then we allocate the weight to each loss for each patch-label pair during weakly-supervised training to enable discriminative disease part learning. We finally extract patch features from the network trained with loss reweighting, and utilize the LSTM network to encode the weighed patch feature sequence into a comprehensive feature representation. Extensive evaluations on this dataset and another public dataset demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method. We expect this research will further the agenda of plant disease recognition in the community of image processing.",

Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

Our model, termed NTS-Net for Navigator-Teacher-Scrutinizer Network, consists of a Navigator agent, a Teacher agent and a Scrutinizer agent. In consideration of intrinsic consistency between informativeness of the regions and their probability being ground-truth class, we design a novel training paradigm, which enables Navigator to detect most informative regions under the guidance from Teacher. After that, the Scrutinizer scrutinizes the proposed regions from Navigator and makes predictions. Our model can be viewed as a multi-agent cooperation, wherein agents benefit from each other, and make progress together.

In order to boost the representational power of a network, several recent approaches have shown the benefit of enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the \"Squeeze-and-Excitation\" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We demonstrate that by stacking these blocks together, we can construct SENet architectures that generalise extremely well across challenging datasets. Crucially, we find that SE blocks produce significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures at minimal additional computational cost. SENets formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and significantly reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, achieving a ~25% relative improvement over the winning entry of 2016.

        "abstract": "Food is a key aspect of our lives because it is the most fundamental necessity of all living things on our planet. Because agriculture provides the majority of our food, it is extremely significant. Agriculture works to produce food goods for the expanding population, but plant diseases also impede the growth and nutritional value of food crops. Here, we'll focus on five different plants: the tomato, the hibiscus, the spinach, the mango tree, and the bitter gourd. This paper suggests a CNN-based method for earlier disease detection in plants. The method involved the following steps: image segmentation, feature extraction, and picture pre-processing. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier is created using the outcomes of these three phases. To conduct research and analysis, an image of the plant's diseased portions is obtained, compared to the desired dataset, and used to predict the disease and provide subsequent treatment options. Following the diagnosis of the disease, the pesticides, their quantity, and the area where they should be applied are displayed. Additionally, it will display the vicinity where pesticides can be found",

        "abstract": "India’s agriculture is primary occupation and it experiences a yearly loss of 35% in crop productivity due to plant-related issues. Advances in technology, such as precision agriculture and the use of Deep learning algorithms, are helping to make this possible. A number of practical and technological challenges, including dataset collecting and labelling, variability in plant leaf images, inter-class similarity, imbalanced datasets, generalization, and real-time detection, are prevalent in the challenging task of detecting plant leaf disease. The main goal of utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for plant leaf disease detection is to precisely categorize images of plant leaves into categories of healthy or diseased. Depending on the particular application scenario, there could be additional goals that researchers try to accomplish with their CNN models in addition to this main one. Tomato is a widely cultivated vegetable and is an important food crop worldwide. Employing machine learning and image processing methods for detecting diseases in tomato plant leaves can be highly efficient. These techniques can be used to analyze images of tomato leaves taken in the field, and an accurate algorithm can be used to identify the presence of disease symptoms. One such approach is using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) algorithm which have been trained on a dataset of images of tomato leaves with and without disease symptoms. This can be done by gathering the images of the healthy tomato leaves and the infected ones and then training a CNN model to detect the difference. The trained model can categorize new images of tomato leaves into healthy or infected, offering a quick and precise method to identify diseases in tomato plants' leaves.",

The need for food production and food plants is of utmost importance for human society to meet the growing demands of an increased population. Automatic plant disease detection using plant images was originally tackled using traditional machine learning and image processing approaches resulting in limited accuracy results and a limited scope. Using deep learning in plant disease detection made it possible to produce higher prediction accuracies as well as broadened the scope of detected diseases and plant species considered.

            "abstract": "The quality and quantity of the crop are significantly affected by numerous diseases in plants. In this regard, an early detection of such diseases is highly effective. Tomato is one of the important crops that is produced in large quantities with high commercial value. Several types of tomato diseases affect the crop at an alarming rate. In this paper, we deployed two Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based models i.e. GoogLeNet and VGG16 for tomato leaf disease classification. The proposed work aims to find the best solution to the problem of tomato leaf disease detection using a deep learning approach. VGG16 obtained 98% accuracy while GoogLeNet obtained 99.23% on Plant Village dataset containing 10735 leaf images. The proposed system can be used in tomato fields for early detection of disease to avoid production loss.",

Detecting infection in plants or crops is an onerous task because the analysis of each crop in large fields takes too much time, effort, work force and expertise. In this paper, we have proposed AI-based detection of pest infected crop and leaf. The proposed method is helpful in analyzing crops in a time-efficient manner and gives more accurate results. The classification of the crops is done on the basis of their images. A publicly available dataset is used to analyze the proposed methodology. Image processing methods are used in order to analyze the crops, further convolutional neural networks are applied to differentiate the healthy crops from the ones that are infected from some disease and also show some visual remarks.",

        "abstract": "Protecting crop yields is the most important aspect of agricultural production, and one of the important measures in preserving yields is the control of crop pests and diseases; therefore, the identification of crop pests and diseases is of irreplaceable importance. In recent years, with the maturity of computer vision technology, more possibilities have been provided for implementing plant disease detection. However, although deep learning methods are widely used in various computer vision tasks, there are still limitations and obstacles in practical applications. Traditional deep learning-based algorithms have some drawbacks in this research area: (1) Recognition accuracy and computational speed cannot be combined. (2) Different pest and disease features interfere with each other and reduce the accuracy of pest and disease diagnosis. (3) Most of the existing researches focus on the recognition efficiency and ignore the inference efficiency, which limits the practical production application. In this study, an integrated model integrating single-stage and two-stage target detection networks is proposed. The single-stage network is based on the YOLO network, and its internal structure is optimized; the two-stage network is based on the Faster-RCNN, and the target frame size is first clustered using a clustering algorithm in the candidate frame generation stage to improve the detection of small targets. Afterwards, the two models are integrated to perform the inference task. For training, we use transfer learning to improve the model training speed. Finally, among the 37 pests and 8 diseases detected, this model achieves 85.2% mAP, which is much higher than other comparative models. After that, we optimize the model for the poor detection categories and verify the generalization performance on open source datasets. In addition, in order to quickly apply this method to real-world scenarios, we developed an application embedded in this model for the mobile platform and put the model into practical agricultural use.",

Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available",

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21:2% top-1 and 5:6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3:5% top-5 error and 17:3% top-1 error on the validation set and 3:6% top-5 error on the official test set.",

            "abstract": ": Internet of Things (IoT) paves a new direction in the domain of smart farmingand precision agriculture. Smart farming is an upgraded version of agriculture which is aimed at improving the cultivation practices and yield to a certain extent. In smart farming, IoT devices are linked among one another with new technologies to improve the agricultural practices. Smart farmingmakes use of IoT devices and contributes in effective decision making. Rice is the major food source in most of the countries. So, it becomes inevitable to detect rice plant diseases during early stages with the help of automated tools and IoT devices. The development and application of Deep Learning (DL) models in agriculture offers a way for early detection of rice diseases and increase the yield and profit.

Therefore accurate and timely detection of leaf disease is very important to check the loss of the crops and meet the growing food demand of the people.

Recently, Deep Neural Networks have been exceptionally fruitful in image classification. In this research paper, plant leaf disease detection employing transfer learning is explored in the JPEG compressed domain.

This paper proposes an optimized detection network model based on a generative module and pruning inference. Due to the problems of instability, non-convergence, and overfitting of convolutional neural networks in the case of insufficient samples, this paper uses a generative module and various image pre-processing methods including Cutout, CutMix, Mixup, SnapMix, and Mosaic algorithms for data augmentation. In order to solve the problem of slowing down the training and inference due to the increasing complexity of detection networks, the pruning inference proposed in this paper can automatically deactivate part of the network structure according to the different conditions, reduce the network parameters and operations, and significantly improve the network speed. The proposed model can achieve 90.01%, 98.79%, and 97.43% in precision, recall, and mAP, respectively, in detecting the apple flowers, and the inference speed can reach 29 FPS. On the YOLO-v5 model with slightly lower performance, the inference speed can reach 71 FPS by the pruning inference. These experimental results demonstrate that the model proposed in this paper can meet the needs of agricultural production.",

This necessitates early detection of these diseases in order to prevent spread and reduce crop damage. The PlantVillage Dataset is the largest open-access database comprising 38 classes of healthy and diseased leaves. However this dataset contains images of leaves taken in a controlled environment which severely restricts the portability of models trained on this dataset to the real world. Motivated by the need to detect a variety of leaf diseases captured under diverse conditions and backgrounds, as is the case presently where many farmers do not have access to lab infrastructure or high-end cameras, we choose the PlantDoc dataset for our experiments. This dataset contains images comprising a subset of 27 classes of the PlantVillage dataset taken under different backgrounds and of varying resolutions. In this paper, we first present a new set of baselines for foliar disease classification using images taken in the field highlighting the inadequacy of current benchmarks. Secondly, we propose a Stacked Ensemble for Multiple Foliar Disease classification (SEMFD-Net), an ensemble model created by stacking a subset of our baseline models and a simple feed-forward neural network as our meta-learner which significantly outperforms the baselines. Our ensemble model also outperforms two other popular ensembling methods namely plurality voting and averaging. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Gateway2745/SEMFD-Net.",

            "abstract": "High temperature and water deficit are the most critical yield-limiting environmental factors for wheat in rainfed environments. It is important to understand the heat avoidance mechanisms and their associations with leaf morpho-physiological traits that allow crops to stay cool and retain high biomass under warm and dry conditions. We examined 20 morpho-physiologically diverse wheat genotypes under ambient and elevated temperatures (Tair) to investigate whether increased water use leads to high biomass retention due to increased leaf cooling. An experiment was conducted under well-watered conditions in two partially controlled glasshouses. We measured plant transpiration (Tr), leaf temperature (Tleaf), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and associated leaf morpho-physiological characteristics. High water use and leaf cooling increased biomass retention under high temperatures, but increased use did not always increase biomass retention. Some genotypes maintained biomass, irrespective of water use, possibly through mechanisms other than leaf cooling, indicating their adaptation under water shortage. Genotypic differences in leaf cooling capacity did not always correlate with Tr (VPD) response. In summary, the contribution of high water use or the leaf cooling effect on biomass retention under high temperature is genotype-dependent and possibly due to variations in leaf morpho-physiological traits. These findings are useful for breeding programs to develop climate resilient wheat cultivars.",

        "abstract": "Papaya cultivation plays a vital role in global agriculture, providing a crucial source of nutrition and economic stability. However, the threat of diseases poses a significant challenge to papaya plant health. To address this challenge, we proposed an innovative approach for enhancing the detection of papaya leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning fusion. Our proposed framework leverages the strengths of CNNs, known for their ability to extract intricate features from images, and the transfer learning approach combines these techniques to create a robust and efficient model for accurate papaya leaf disease diagnosis. Transfer learning approach with two pre-trained models: VGG-16 and ResNet-50 are taken to detect papaya leaf diseases. The training process involves utilizing a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on a specific papaya leaf disease dataset. For experimentation, five different classes of papaya leaves such as Fresh Papaya Leaf, Papaya Black Spot, Papaya Leaf Curl, Papaya Ringspot, and Powdery Mildew of Papaya are considered. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in accurately identifying and classifying various papaya leaf diseases. The proposed model has received an accuracy of 99.79% using ResetNet-50 followed by CNN whose accuracy was 99.42% and VGG-16, whose accuracy was 98.25%. This fusion approach aims to create a robust and efficient model capable of distinguishing subtle patterns indicative of various papaya leaf diseases. This method not only improves the efficiency of disease detection but also demonstrates the adaptability of the model to various disease patterns. Our study contributes to the advancement of automated papaya leaf disease detection, providing a reliable and precise tool for early diagnosis. Overall, our approach offers a promising solution for improving papaya cultivation and ensuring a sustainable future for global agriculture.",

            "abstract": "Deep Learning for plant leaf analysis has been recently studied in various works. In most cases, Transfer Learning has been utilized, where the weights of networks, which are stored in the pre-trained models, are fine-tuned to use in the considered task. In this paper, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are employed to classify tomato plant leaf images based on the visible effects of diseases. In addition to Transfer Learning as an effective approach, training a CNN from scratch using the Deep Residual Learning method, is experimented. To do that, an architecture of CNN is proposed and applied to a subset of the PlantVillage dataset, including tomato plant leaf images. The results indicate that the suggested architecture outperforms VGG models, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, in both accuracy and the time required for re-training, and it can be used with a regular PC without any extra hardware required. A common feature visualization and verification technique is also applied to the results and further discussions are made to imply the importance of background pixels surrounding the leaves.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging is emerging as a promising approach for plant disease identification. The large and possibly redundant information contained in hyperspectral data cubes makes deep learning based identification of plant diseases a natural fit. Here, we deploy a novel 3D deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) that directly assimilates the hyperspectral data. Furthermore, we interrogate the learnt model to produce physiologically meaningful explanations. We focus on an economically important disease, charcoal rot, which is a soil borne fungal disease that affects the yield of soybean crops worldwide. Based on hyperspectral imaging of inoculated and mock-inoculated stem images, our 3D DCNN has a classification accuracy of 95.73% and an infected class F1 score of 0.87. Using the concept of a saliency map, we visualize the most sensitive pixel locations, and show that the spatial regions with visible disease symptoms are overwhelmingly chosen by the model for classification. We also find that the most sensitive wavelengths used by the model for classification are in the near infrared region (NIR), which is also the commonly used spectral range for determining the vegetative health of a plant. The use of an explainable deep learning model not only provides high accuracy, but also provides physiological insight into model predictions, thus generating confidence in model predictions. These explained predictions lend themselves for eventual use in precision agriculture and research application using automated phenotyping platforms.",

These image processing techniques have been applied to various provinces including medical field, remote sensing, robot vision, pattern recognition, video processing, color processing, and so on in order to solve real world problems. These approaches have also been found out to be effective in the domain of Agriculture for the prediction of crop yield, leaf disease detection, fruit disease detection, vegetable quality evaluation, etc. Due to the immoderate usage of fertilizers and insecticides, the quality of plants and crops gets degraded to huge extent; and the plant diseases are generally detected by experts through naked eyes. In this paper, the authors proposed an ensemble model based on Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for the detection of plant diseases from the leaves. The experimentation has been carried out on benchmark dataset of Plant Disease Images. This dataset consists of 1000 images of Healthy Leaves and three plant diseases i.e. Brown Rust, Early Blight and Late Blight. The proposed approach works in four steps: Segmentation by K-Means Clustering, Feature Extraction by GLCM, Feature Selection by Random Forest, and Classification of plant disease by KNN. The performance of the proposed approach has also been evaluated with traditional support vector machine (SVM) on the basis of three measures such as accuracy, precision and recall. The experimental results revealed that the proposed approach outperformed SVM.",

Due to plant diseases, the quantity and quality of agriculture yield are reduced. The study of plant disease refers to the study of clearly visible patterns of plant leaves. So, recognition of the unhealthy regions of plants may be thought about the way of saving the decrease of productivity and crops. The early-stage diagnosis of plant diseases like viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc. is most essential to control and cure the disease. The manual identifications of diseases are a time-consuming process. Hence, some experts are required to recognize the disease. There are varied standard methods such as classification model, image processing, and machine learning models that are utilized to detect and recognize the disease on agricultural yields. This article provides varied existing models are made familiar with the detection of disease in agricultural product. Further, it presents a survey on varied classification models with the analysis, which could be utilized to classify and identify the plant leaf diseases. It also discusses the outline of segmentation, feature extraction, and varied classifier techniques.",

This research presents a modern ensemble learning methodology for classifying plant diseases utilizing leaf imagery. The advantages of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is taken here by including two pre-trained CNNs as foundational classifiers. These base classifiers extract high-level features from the leaf images. Subsequently, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integrates the extracted features from both CNNs to achieve a robust and comprehensive representation of the disease patterns. This ensemble architecture enhances generalization and mitigates the danger of overfitting the training data. The proposed model is assessed using the comprehensive PlantVillage dataset, with a classification accuracy of 98.23%. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the ensemble learning approach for plant disease detection, potentially aiding in developing automated disease diagnosis systems for improved agricultural practices.",

            "abstract": "The contribution of a plant is highly important for both human life and environment. Plants do suffer from diseases, like human beings and animals. There is the number of plant diseases that occur and affects the normal growth of a plant. These diseases affect complete plant including leaf, stem, fruit, root, and flower. Most of the time when the disease of a plant has not been taken care of, the plant dies or may cause leaves drop, flowers, and fruits drop. Appropriate diagnosis of such diseases is required for accurate identification and treatment of plant diseases. Plant pathology is the study of plant diseases, their causes, procedures for controlling and managing them. But, the existing method encompasses human involvement for classification and identification of diseases. This procedure is time-consuming and costly. Automatic segmentation of diseases from plant leaf images using soft computing approach can be reasonably useful than the existing one. In this paper, we have introduced a method named as bacterial foraging optimization based radial basis function neural network (BRBFNN) for identification and classification of plant leaf diseases automatically. For assigning optimal weight to radial basis function neural network we use bacterial foraging optimization that further increases the speed and accuracy of the network to identify and classify the regions infected of different diseases on the plant leafs. The region growing algorithm increases the efficiency of the network by searching and grouping of seed points having common attributes for feature extraction process. We worked on fungal diseases like common rust, cedar apple rust, late blight, leaf curl, leaf spot, and early blight. The proposed method attains higher accuracy in identification and classification of diseases.",

            "abstract": "The disease spots on the grape leaves can be detected by using the image processing and deep learning methods. However, the accuracy and efficiency of the detection are still the challenges. The convolutional substrate information is fuzzy, and the detection results are not satisfactory if the disease spot is relatively small. In particular, the detection will be difficult if the number of pixels of the spot is <32 × 32 in the image. In order to effectively address this problem, we present a super-resolution image enhancement and convolutional neural network-based algorithm for the detection of black rot on grape leaves. First, the original image is up-sampled and enhanced with local details using the bilinear interpolation. As a result, the number of pixels in the image increase. Then, the enhanced images are fed into the proposed YOLOv3-SPP network for detection. In the proposed network, the IOU (Intersection Over Union, IOU) in the original YOLOv3 network is replaced with GIOU (Generalized Intersection Over Union, GIOU). In addition, we also add the SPP (Spatial Pyramid Pooling, SPP) module to improve the detection performance of the network. Finally, the official pre-trained weights of YOLOv3 are used for fast convergence. The test set test_pv from the Plant Village and the test set test_orchard from the orchard field were used to evaluate the network performance. The results of test_pv show that the grape leaf black rot is detected by the YOLOv3-SPP with 95.79% detection accuracy and 94.52% detector recall, which is a 5.94% greater in terms of accuracy and 10.67% greater in terms of recall as compared to the original YOLOv3. The results of test_orchard show that the method proposed in this paper can be applied in field environment with 86.69% detection precision and 82.27% detector recall, and the accuracy and recall were improved to 94.05 and 93.26% if the images with the simple background. Therefore, the detection method proposed in this work effectively solves the detection task of small targets and improves the detection effectiveness of the grape leaf black rot.",

            "title": "Design of ensemble recurrent model with stacked fuzzy ARTMAP for breast cancer detection",
            "abstract": "PurposeIn time and accurate detection of cancer can save the life of the person affected. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), breast cancer occupies the most frequent incidence among all the cancers whereas breast cancer takes fifth place in the case of mortality numbers. Out of many image processing techniques, certain works have focused on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for processing these images. However, deep learning models are to be explored well.Design/methodology/approachIn this work, multivariate statistics-based kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is used for essential features. KPCA is simultaneously helpful for denoising the data. These features are processed through a heterogeneous ensemble model that consists of three base models. The base models comprise recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The outcomes of these base learners are fed to fuzzy adaptive resonance theory mapping (ARTMAP) model for decision making as the nodes are added to the F_2ˆa layer if the winning criteria are fulfilled that makes the ARTMAP model more robust.FindingsThe proposed model is verified using breast histopathology image dataset publicly available at Kaggle. The model provides 99.36% training accuracy and 98.72% validation accuracy. The proposed model utilizes data processing in all aspects, i.e. image denoising to reduce the data redundancy, training by ensemble learning to provide higher results than that of single models. The final classification by a fuzzy ARTMAP model that controls the number of nodes depending upon the performance makes robust accurate classification.Research limitations/implicationsResearch in the field of medical applications is an ongoing method. More advanced algorithms are being developed for better classification. Still, the scope is there to design the models in terms of better performance, practicability and cost efficiency in the future. Also, the ensemble models may be chosen with different combinations and characteristics. Only signal instead of images may be verified for this proposed model. Experimental analysis shows the improved performance of the proposed model. This method needs to be verified using practical models. Also, the practical implementation will be carried out for its real-time performance and cost efficiency.Originality/valueThe proposed model is utilized for denoising and to reduce the data redundancy so that the feature selection is done using KPCA. Training and classification are performed using heterogeneous ensemble model designed using RNN, LSTM and GRU as base classifiers to provide higher results than that of single models. Use of adaptive fuzzy mapping model makes the final classification accurate. The effectiveness of combining these methods to a single model is analyzed in this work.",

The computer-vision and AI-based system detects and classifies the presence or absence of disease in the leaves from an image, thus enabling early-stage identification of a disease for precision agriculture. An extensive dataset is preprocessed and augmented before training the model. The YOLOv11 model is adopted due to its efficiency in high-accuracy real-time processing. A user-friendly web application using the Streamlit library allows users to upload images with immediate classification results on the application. Performance evaluation metrics of the system are accuracy, precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP). This solution improves crop health management and allows scalable growth for large-scale farming operations, with future possibilities expanding the scope to specific disease and pest identification.",

            "abstract": "Alternaria leaf spot, Brown spot, Mosaic, Grey spot, and Rust are five common types of apple leaf diseases that severely affect apple yield. However, the existing research lacks an accurate and fast detector of apple diseases for ensuring the healthy development of the apple industry. This paper proposes a deep learning approach that is based on improved convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the real-time detection of apple leaf diseases. In this paper, the apple leaf disease dataset (ALDD), which is composed of laboratory images and complex images under real field conditions, is first constructed via data augmentation and image annotation technologies. Based on this, a new apple leaf disease detection model that uses deep-CNNs is proposed by introducing the GoogLeNet Inception structure and Rainbow concatenation. Finally, under the hold-out testing dataset, using a dataset of 26,377 images of diseased apple leaves, the proposed INAR-SSD (SSD with Inception module and Rainbow concatenation) model is trained to detect these five common apple leaf diseases. The experimental results show that the INAR-SSD model realizes a detection performance of 78.80% mAP on ALDD, with a high-detection speed of 23.13 FPS. The results demonstrate that the novel INAR-SSD model provides a high-performance solution for the early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases that can perform real-time detection of these diseases with higher accuracy and faster detection speed than previous methods.",

At the same time, Apple plants are among the plants that are the most prone to diseases. Disease identification at an early stage and its prevention before spreading into other parts of the plant is a challenge even for the expert’s eye. Therefore, an adequate system is required to detect plant disease in the initial stage. This paper displays the prowess of Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect and address the issue. Images of Apple leaves, covering various diseases as well as healthy samples, from the Plant Village dataset are used to validate results. Image filtering, image compression, and image generation techniques are used to gain a large train-set of images and tune the system perfectly. The trained model achieves high accuracy scores in all the classes with a net accuracy of 98.54% on the entire dataset, sampled and generated from 2561-labelled images.",

Recognition of handwritten character is more difficult one as compares with the printed one due to their similar structure and orientation.

Here in this proposed work we have completely focused on handwritten characters and numerals of various scripts of different regions of India such as Bengali, Odia scripts. To have a proper solution for the ambiguities that arises in handwritten one and which has been resolved using the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) as feature extraction part. This transformed based featured is used to calculated GLCM values of each images of handwritten numerals and characters. To maintain the novelty of the work in simulation part we have listed up variance nature of the individual’s images. Subsequently we have also harnessed the SVM, Neural Network, and Quadratic Classifier over dataset to report the recognition rate. After validating the proposed work, we can conclude that adopted model is quite helpful in building the automatic recognition system for both handwritten character and numerals to have solution for real time problems.",

Data Hiding technology is an efficient way to solve the problems of data leakage and loss of information. Data hiding called steganography is a security method to provide security to secret data which is transferred from sender to receiver from harmful attacks. Steganography is an interaction of concealing a mysterious message inside a cover object which is not secret. There are many cover media like images, audio, video, text files etc. There are many ways to approach steganography like spatial domain, transformation domain, masking and filtering. This technique is helpful because the human eye is quite insensitive to the minute changes that help the embedded data stay safe and secure. The main motive of steganography is to get high stego image quality, low computational complexity, more embedding capability, visually unnoticeable, invisibility, and improved security. A capable steganographic technique must be resistant to any steganalysis approach the secret data is prone to. In this proposed system, implement the GUI implementation image steganography in spatial domain using Least Significant Bit (LSB) where the modified high capacity cover image undergoes the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) and propose an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) secret key stego system such that the data is secure. The distortion between the two images in identified with the help of MSE and Histogram analysis.",

Mostly, these constraints are identified as diseases and pests that are hard to detect with bare eyes. This study focused to develop a model to boost the detection of cotton leaf disease and pests using the deep learning technique, CNN. To do so, the researchers have used common cotton leaf disease and pests such as bacterial blight, spider mite, and leaf miner. K-fold cross-validation strategy was worn to dataset splitting and boosted generalization of the CNN model. For this research, nearly 2400 specimens (600 images in each class) were accessed for training purposes. This developed model is implemented using python version 3.7.3 and the model is equipped on the deep learning package called Keras, TensorFlow backed, and Jupyter which are used as the developmental environment. This model achieved an accuracy of 96.4% for identifying classes of leaf disease and pests in cotton plants. This revealed the feasibility of its usage in real-time applications and the potential need for IT-based solutions to support traditional or manual disease and pest’s identification.",

The diseases on the cotton are critical issue which makes the sharp decrease in the production of cotton. So for the study of interest is the leaf rather than whole cotton plant because about 85-95 % of diseases occurred on the cotton leaves like Alternaria, Cercospora and Red Leaf Spot. In this proposal initially preprocessing the input image using histogram equalization is applied to increase the contrast in low contrast image, K-means clustering algorithm is used for segmentation which classifies objects based on a set of features into K number of classes and finally classification is performed using Neural-network. Thus image processing technique is used for detecting diseases on cotton leaves early and accurately. It is used to analyze the cotton diseases which will be useful to farmers.",

Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (BiLSTM) with the Attention mechanism manages to derive relevant features from raw EEG signals. The connected graph convolutional neural network (GCN) promotes the decoding performance by cooperating with the topological structure of features, which are estimated from the overall data. The 0.4-second detection framework has shown effective and efficient prediction based on individual and group-wise training, with 98.81% and 94.64% accuracy, respectively, which outperformed all the state-of-the-art studies. The introduced deep feature mining approach can precisely recognize human motion intents from raw EEG signals, which paves the road to translate the EEG based MI recognition to practical BCI systems.",

            "abstract": "Toward the development of effective and efficient brain–computer interface (BCI) systems, precise decoding of brain activity measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG) is highly demanded. Traditional works classify EEG signals without considering the topological relationship among electrodes. However, neuroscience research has increasingly emphasized network patterns of brain dynamics. Thus, the Euclidean structure of electrodes might not adequately reflect the interaction between signals. To fill the gap, a novel deep learning (DL) framework based on the graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) is presented to enhance the decoding performance of raw EEG signals during different types of motor imagery (MI) tasks while cooperating with the functional topological relationship of electrodes. Based on the absolute Pearson’s matrix of overall signals, the graph Laplacian of EEG electrodes is built up. The GCNs-Net constructed by graph convolutional layers learns the generalized features. The followed pooling layers reduce dimensionality, and the fully-connected (FC) softmax layer derives the final prediction. The introduced approach has been shown to converge for both personalized and groupwise predictions. It has achieved the highest averaged accuracy, 93.06% and 88.57% (PhysioNet dataset), 96.24% and 80.89% (high gamma dataset), at the subject and group level, respectively, compared with existing studies, which suggests adaptability and robustness to individual variability. Moreover, the performance is stably reproducible among repetitive experiments for cross-validation. The excellent performance of our method has shown that it is an important step toward better BCI approaches. To conclude, the GCNs-Net filters EEG signals based on the functional topological relationship, which manages to decode relevant features for brain MI.

Finally, the trained assessment model is employed to determine the systems stability status in real time.

However, it has limited interpretability for deep features. With the transfer of expert knowledge, handcrafted features provide a new way for personalized diagnosis of plant diseases. However, irrelevant and redundant features lead to high dimensionality. In this study, we proposed a swarm intelligence algorithm for feature selection [salp swarm algorithm for feature selection (SSAFS)] in image-based plant disease detection. SSAFS is employed to determine the ideal combination of handcrafted features to maximize classification success while minimizing the number of features. To verify the effectiveness of the developed SSAFS algorithm, we conducted experimental studies using SSAFS and 5 metaheuristic algorithms. Several evaluation metrics were used to evaluate and analyze the performance of these methods on 4 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and 6 plant phenomics datasets from PlantVillage. Experimental results and statistical analyses validated the outstanding performance of SSAFS compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, confirming the superiority of SSAFS in exploring the feature space and identifying the most valuable features for diseased plant image classification. This computational tool will allow us to explore an optimal combination of handcrafted features to improve plant disease recognition accuracy and processing time.",

The removal of irrelevant and redundant information often improves the performance of machine learning algorithms. There are two common approaches: a wrapper uses the intended learning algorithm itself to evaluate the usefulness of features, while a fllter evaluates features according to heuristics based on general characteristics of the data. The wrapper approach is generally considered to produce better feature subsets but runs much more slowly than a fllter. This paper describes a new fllter approach to feature selection that uses a correlation based heuristic to evaluate the worth of feature subsets When applied as a data preprocessing step for two common machine learning algorithms, the new method compares favourably with the wrapper but requires much less computation.",

With the exponential increment of data, the data science, or more specifically, the big data analytics has gained increasing attention among researchers. New and more efficient algorithms should be designed to handle this massive data problem. Based on the combination of population-based algorithms and data mining techniques, we understand better the insights of data analytics, and design more efficient algorithms to solve real-world big data analytics problems. Also, the weakness and strength of population-based algorithms could be analyzed via the data analytics along the optimization process, a crucial entity in population-based algorithms.",

Self-explaining models where interpretability plays a key role already during learning have received much less attention. We propose three desiderata for explanations in general – explicitness, faithfulness, and stability – and show that existing methods do not satisfy them. In response, we design self-explaining models in stages, progressively generalizing linear classifiers to complex yet architecturally explicit models. Faithfulness and stability are enforced via regularization specifically tailored to such models. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets show that our framework offers a promising direction for reconciling model complexity and interpretability.",

Hand-crafted features are designed to describe image content from specific aspects, which may provide complementary information for CNN in image classification tasks. This paper explores feature fusion methods and proposes a novel framework for combining CNN with hand-crafted features. The framework has two main advantages. First, feature encoder can encode non-normalized features in CNN, which takes advantage of some good edge, texture and local features. Second, joint training strategy makes features fuse better in CNN. We validate that many handcrafted features help to improve the performance of origin CNN. Experiments show our method outperforms the origin CaffeNet on Cifar10 dataset with 79.16% accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. We developed machine learning methods to identify fibrolipidic and fibrocalcific A-lines in intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) images using a comprehensive set of handcrafted features. We incorporated features developed in previous studies (e.g., optical attenuation and A-line peaks). In addition, we included vascular lumen morphology and three-dimensional (3-D) digital edge and texture features. Classification methods were developed using expansive datasets (∼7000  images), consisting of both clinical in-vivo images and an ex-vivo dataset, which was validated using 3-D cryo-imaging/histology. Conditional random field was used to perform 3-D classification noise cleaning of classification results. We tested various multiclass approaches, classifiers, and feature selection schemes and found that a three-class support vector machine with minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance feature selection gave the best performance. We found that inclusion of our morphological and 3-D features improved overall classification accuracy. On a held-out test set consisting of >1700 images, we obtained an overall accuracy of 81.58%, with the following (sensitivity/specificity) for each class: other (81.43/89.59), fibrolipidic (94.48/87.32), and fibrocalcific (74.82/95.28). The en-face views of classification results showed that automated classification easily captured the preponderance of a disease segment (e.g., a calcified segment had large regions of fibrocalcific classifications). Finally, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for streamlining A-line classification output with existing fibrolipidic and fibrocalcific boundary segmentation methods, to enable fully automated plaque quantification. The results suggest that our classification approach is a viable step toward fully automated IVOCT plaque classification and segmentation for live-time treatment planning and for offline assessment of drug and biologic therapeutics.",

The HC features, specifically developed for this application, include Gaussian mixture models, Euler characteristic curves and texture analysis. Using HC features outperforms the CNN for smaller sample sizes and with increased interpretability. On the other hand, with enough training data, the combined classifier outperforms the models trained with HC features or CNN features alone. These results illustrate the added value of HC features with respect to CNNs, especially when insufficient data is available, as is often found in clinical studies.",

            "abstract": "High dimensional datasets expose a critical obstacle in machine learning. Feature selection overcomes this obstacle by eliminating duplicated and unimportant features from the dataset to increase the robustness of learning algorithms. This paper introduces a binary version of a hybrid swarm intelligence approach as a wrapper method for feature selection that gathers between the strengths of both the grey wolf and particle swarm optimizers. This approach is named Improved Binary Grey Wolf Optimization (IBGWO). The original version of this hybrid approach was proposed in the literature with a continuous search space as a high-level hybrid form, which runs the optimizers one after the other. Two different types of transfer functions, named S-Shaped and V-Shaped, are applied in this work to turn continuous data into binary. Nine of high-dimensional small-instance medical datasets are employed to assess the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that IBGWO based on S-Shaped (IBGWO-S) outperforms the binary particle swarm and the binary grey wolf optimizers on six out of nine datasets according to the classification accuracy and fitness values. IBGWO-S selects the fewest features on 100% of the datasets. The results show IBGWO based on V-Shaped (IBGWO-V) outperforms the binary particle swarm and binary grey wolf optimizers on five datasets based on the classification accuracy and fitness values. The results indicate that IBGWO-V outperforms IBGWO-S in terms of all studied evaluation metrics. The results also show that IBGWO-S and IBGWO-V outperform eight meta-heuristics known in the literature in selecting the relevant features with acceptable classification accuracy.",

In particular, the analysis of seeds can provide meaningful information on their evolution, the history of agriculture, the domestication of plants, and knowledge of diets in ancient times. This work aims to propose an exhaustive comparison of several different types of features in the context of multiclass seed classification, leveraging two public plant seeds data sets to classify their families or species. In detail, we studied possible optimisations of five traditional machine learning classifiers trained with seven different categories of handcrafted features. We also fine-tuned several well-known convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the recently proposed SeedNet to determine whether and to what extent using their deep features may be advantageous over handcrafted features. The experimental results demonstrated that CNN features are appropriate to the task and representative of the multiclass scenario. In particular, SeedNet achieved a mean F-measure of 96%, at least. Nevertheless, several cases showed satisfactory performance from the handcrafted features to be considered a valid alternative. In detail, we found that the Ensemble strategy combined with all the handcrafted features can achieve 90.93% of mean F-measure, at least, with a considerably lower amount of times. We consider the obtained results an excellent preliminary step towards realising an automatic seeds recognition and classification framework.",

            "abstract": "The detection of plant disease is of vital importance in practical agricultural production. It scrutinizes the plant's growth and health condition and guarantees the regular operation and harvest of the agricultural planting to proceed successfully. In recent decades, the maturation of computer vision technology has provided more possibilities for implementing plant disease detection. Nonetheless, detecting plant diseases is typically hindered by factors such as variations in the illuminance and weather when capturing images and the number of leaves or organs containing diseases in one image. Meanwhile, traditional deep learning-based algorithms attain multiple deficiencies in the area of this research: (1) Training models necessitate a significant investment in hardware and a large amount of data. (2) Due to their slow inference speed, models are tough to acclimate to practical production. (3) Models are unable to generalize well enough. Provided these impediments, this study suggested a Tranvolution detection network with GAN modules for plant disease detection. Foremost, a generative model was added ahead of the backbone, and GAN models were added to the attention extraction module to construct GAN modules. Afterward, the Transformer was modified and incorporated with the CNN, and then we suggested the Tranvolution architecture. Eventually, we validated the performance of different generative models' combinations. Experimental outcomes demonstrated that the proposed method satisfyingly achieved 51.7% (Precision), 48.1% (Recall), and 50.3% (mAP), respectively. Furthermore, the SAGAN model was the best in the attention extraction module, while WGAN performed best in image augmentation. Additionally, we deployed the proposed model on Hbird E203 and devised an intelligent agricultural robot to put the model into practical agricultural use.",

Challenges such as pests, plant diseases, and evolving climate patterns pose threats to crop yield and production. Addressing these challenges, timely and accurate detection of plant diseases emerges as imperative. Manual detection, however, remains resource-intensive and often lags. Addressing this gap, this project proposes an innovative image processing-based system for rapidly detecting plant diseases. The system proficiently identifies specific diseases by analyzing images of plant leaves against a curated dataset. The emphasis of this study was on three major diseases: Bacterial Blight (with an accuracy of 98.6%), Alternaria Alternata (98.5714%), and Cercospora Leaf Spot (97.5%). The compelling results underline the system's capacity to swiftly and effectively categorize diseases, offering monoculture farmers an indispensable tool for obtaining prompt, disease-specific insights.",

However, the widespread adoption of smartphones and recent advancements in computer vision, powered by deep learning, have opened up new possibilities for disease detection with the help of smartphones. Through the utilization of a deep convolutional neural network, trained on a publicly available dataset of 54,306 images featuring damaged and healthy plant leaves obtained under controlled conditions, it becomes possible to recognize 14 crop species and identify 26 different illnesses or determine if the plant is healthy. This deep learning model, boasting an impressive accuracy rate of 98.59%, proves to be the most effective artificial neural network topology for detecting plant diseases. By following a strategy that involves developing deep learning models on progressively larger image datasets and making them accessible to the public, the path is paved for widespread smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a global scale. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable performance in image recognition tasks, including plant disease detection. These models are trained on large datasets of labeled images to learn patterns and features indicative of different diseases.",

        "title": "Tomato Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using Image Recognition: A Case Study of Mlali in Morogoro Region, Tanzania",
        "abstract": "Tomato plant diseases pose a big problem as they drastically reduce the quantity of a farm’s yield and also result in poor tomato quality, which may affect users. Detecting and identifying leaf diseases in tomato plants is a big challenge for farmers and agricultural officers due to the lack of necessary knowledge and diagnosis tools. This study developed a diagnostic tool accessible through a mobile phone application that can easily be used in the field. The tool uses image recognition technology to classify tomato disease from affected plants. The methodology used to develop the image recognition model was a deep learning technique using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture, trained and evaluated using four different models for detecting bacterial spots, late blight, early blight, and healthy tomato leaf. Those models were ResNet18, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNet. Since the existing dataset was limited, the learning approach was used to transfer knowledge (weight and bias) of selected models and use it to train on the existing data of tomato. The dataset contains 1000 images for each class, but for unknown images only contains 100 images used in training, 50 images for each class used in validation (val), and 50 for each class used in the test. The four classes of common tomato leaf diseases, early blight, late blight, bacterial spots, healthy tomato leaf, and unknown images, were used for training, validation, and testing. The EfficientNet model achieved an F-score accuracy of 0.91%, Resnet50 achieved an F-score accuracy of 0.99%, Resnet18 achieved an F-score accuracy of 0.99%, and InceptionV3 achieved an F-score accuracy of 0.84%. The model evaluation results for all classes were efficient since the confusion matrix gave correct precision, recall, and F-score values for both test and validation datasets. The research picked the resnet18 model for integration with mobile applications because it only uses less memory, and it has given high prediction in the classification of tomato diseases compared to other models. The developed system can detect tomato plant leaf diseases and give farmers procedures on how to control and prevent the disease; also, the system has the benefit of supporting smallholder. Farmers and extension officers detect tomato plant leaf diseases, thus helping to detect diseases at an early stage and helping to increase the quality of tomatoes. ",

The purpose of this paper is to find out whether official development assistance for agriculture is effective.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe data for development assistance for agriculture are broken down into the major agricultural sectors in receiving countries. The empirical evidence is based on the two-step system, i.e. generalized method of moments, to assess the degree of responsiveness of agricultural productivity to development assistance.\n\n\nFindings\nThere is a positive relationship between development assistance and agricultural productivity in general. However, when broken down into the major agricultural recipient sectors, there is a substitution effect between food crop production and industrial crop production. Better institutions and economic freedom are found to enable agricultural productivity growth, and to increase the effectiveness of development assistance. The structural economic transformation associated with agricultural development assistance is also found to be weak.\n\n\nPractical implications\nAllocation of development assistance for agriculture is primarily determined by need, although expected effectiveness also increases the assistance receipts. Agricultural assistance policies could focus more on building productive capacity to reduce the need while boosting effectiveness.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nBreaking down data into agricultural recipient sectors and controlling for the potential spurious correlation under the assumption that more development assistance could be allocated, where agricultural productivity is already increasing due to some other factors.\n",

Diseases are detrimental to the plant's health which in turn affects its growth. To ensure minimal losses to the cultivated crop, it is crucial to supervise its growth. There are numerous types of tomato diseases that target the crop's leaf at an alarming rate. This paper adopts a slight variation of the convolutional neural network model called LeNet to detect and identify diseases in tomato leaves. The main aim of the proposed work is to find a solution to the problem of tomato leaf disease detection using the simplest approach while making use of minimal computing resources to achieve results comparable to state of the art techniques. Neural network models employ automatic feature extraction to aid in the classification of the input image into respective disease classes. This proposed system has achieved an average accuracy of 94–95 % indicating the feasibility of the neural network approach even under unfavourable conditions.",

The present study aims at shedding light on machine learning in agriculture by thoroughly reviewing the recent scholarly literature based on keywords’ combinations of “machine learning” along with “crop management”, “water management”, “soil management”, and “livestock management”, and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only journal papers were considered eligible that were published within 2018–2020. The results indicated that this topic pertains to different disciplines that favour convergence research at the international level. Furthermore, crop management was observed to be at the centre of attention. A plethora of machine learning algorithms were used, with those belonging to Artificial Neural Networks being more efficient. In addition, maize and wheat as well as cattle and sheep were the most investigated crops and animals, respectively. Finally, a variety of sensors, attached on satellites and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, have been utilized as a means of getting reliable input data for the data analyses. It is anticipated that this study will constitute a beneficial guide to all stakeholders towards enhancing awareness of the potential advantages of using machine learning in agriculture and contributing to a more systematic research on this topic.",

Disease attacks are constant threats to agriculture and cause heavy losses in the country’s economy. Therefore, early detection can mitigate the severity of diseases and protect crops. However, manual disease identification is both time-consuming and error prone, and requires a thorough knowledge of plant pathogens. Instead, automated methods save both time and effort. This paper presents a contemporary overview of research undertaken over the past decade in the field of disease identification of different crops using machine learning, deep learning, image processing techniques, the Internet of Things, and hyperspectral image analysis. Additionally, a comparative study of several techniques applied to crop disease detection was carried out. Furthermore, this paper discusses the different challenges to be overcome and possible solutions. Then, several suggestions to address these challenges are provided. Finally, this research provides a future perspective that promises to be a highly useful and valuable resource for researchers working in the field of crop disease detection.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture has become the most important due to its applicability in a non-exhaustive sector of the economy. The creative approach to the introduction of agricultural technology is highly increased today. Advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled fast and efficient pest recognition algorithms. Control of diseased leaves in the cropping stage is an important step. Detecting disease at an early stage and analysing affected leaves is always beneficial for agricultural development. Similarly, pest diseases hit down the development and production of Agri based resources, so their accurate recognition is required to use pesticides and eradicate the pests. In this study we provide a transfer learning-based explanation for detecting multiple diseases in different plant selections using images of healthy and diseased plants, derived from Plant Doc dataset. This paper shows a comparative study of various YOLO versions on the PlantDoc and Our own curated Plant Disease and Pest Detection Models based on YOLO versions v7 and v8 and the ability to perform detection much faster and with higher precision than the existing models developed previously.",

            "abstract": "Tomato is affected by various diseases and pests during its growth process. If the control is not timely, it will lead to yield reduction or even crop failure. How to control the diseases and pests effectively and help the vegetable farmers to improve the yield of tomato is very important, and the most important thing is to accurately identify the diseases and insect pests. Compared with the traditional pattern recognition method, the diseases and pests recognition method based on deep learning can directly input the original image. Instead of the tedious steps such as image preprocessing, feature extraction and feature classification in the traditional method, the end-to-end structure is adopted to simplify the recognition process and solve the problem that the feature extractor designed manually is difficult to obtain the feature expression closest to the natural attribute of the object. Based on the application of deep learning object detection, not only can save time and effort, but also can achieve real-time judgment, greatly reduce the huge loss caused by diseases and pests, which has important research value and significance. Based on the latest research results of detection theory based on deep learning object detection and the characteristics of tomato diseases and pests images, this study will build the dataset of tomato diseases and pests under the real natural environment, optimize the feature layer of Yolo V3 model by using image pyramid to achieve multi-scale feature detection, improve the detection accuracy and speed of Yolo V3 model, and detect the location and category of diseases and pests of tomato accurately and quickly. Through the above research, the key technology of tomato pest image recognition in natural environment is broken through, which provides reference for intelligent recognition and engineering application of plant diseases and pests detection.",

But due to scarcity of knowledge, farmers are in a daze about kinds of diseases that affect the farm. Many farmers struggle and waste much of their time in reaping diseased crops. The timely assessment of the problem is necessary to avert major damage and enhance production. The proposed system makes use of a novel approach of the object detection technique to detect plant disease, YOLO(You Only Look Once). YOLO processes leaf images at 45 frames per second in real-time, which is faster than other object detection techniques. It divides the image into several grid cells before processing the image. The bounding boxes and class probabilities are predicted by a single neural network in just one evaluation. This effectively boosts the speed and accuracy of disease detection on the leaf.",

The soybean is the world's most economically important bean, providing vegetable protein to millions of people as well as ingredients for hundreds of chemical goods. Object detection is a computer vision task that involves the identification of object class with its location in the image. We have employed three popular object detection algorithms for insect identification on Soybean crop fields. YOLO v3, v4, and v5 have been trained to detect and demarcate the insect presence on the field. The simulation results revealed that the YOLO v5 delivers the best insect detection accuracy with mean average precision (mAP) of 99.5% followed by YOLO v4 and v3.",

The orchard pest dataset, PestImgData, was built through a series of methods such as web crawler, specimen image collection and data augmentation. PestImgData was composed of two parts, PestImgData-1 and PestImgData-2. It contained 24,796 color images and covered 7 types of orchard pests. Based on the PestImgData and YOLOv4 algorithm, this paper conducted a preliminary study on the real-time object detection of orchard pests from 4 perspectives: transfer learning, activation function, anchor box, and batch normalization. In addition, this paper also visualized the feature learning ability of the detection models. On the basis of the above research, three improvement measures were adopted: the post-processing NMS algorithm was upgraded to DIoU-NMS, the training method was upgraded to 2-time finetuning training and the training data was enhanced. The performance of the improved model, F-D-YOLOv4-PEST, had been effectively improved. The mean average precision of F-D-YOLOv4-PEST was 92.86%, and the detection time of a single picture was 12.22 ms, which could meet the real-time detection requirements. In addition, in the case of high overlap area or high density, F-D-YOLOv4-PEST still maintained good performance. In the testing process of the laboratory and the greenhouse, including the wired network and the wireless network, F-D-YOLOv4-PEST could locate and classify pests as expected. This research could provide technical reference for the intelligent identification of agricultural pests based on deep learning.",

            "abstract": "Apple leaf diseases seriously damage the yield and quality of apples. Current apple leaf disease diagnosis methods primarily rely on human visual inspection, which often results in low efficiency and insufficient accuracy. Many computer vision algorithms have been proposed to diagnose apple leaf diseases, but most of them are designed to run on high-performance GPUs. This potentially limits their application in the field, in which mobile devices are expected to be used to perform computer vision-based disease diagnosis on the spot. In this paper, we propose a lightweight one-stage network, called the Mobile Ghost Attention YOLO network (MGA-YOLO), which enables real-time diagnosis of apple leaf diseases on mobile devices. We also built a dataset, called the Apple Leaf Disease Object Detection dataset (ALDOD), that contains 8,838 images of healthy and infected apple leaves with complex backgrounds, collected from existing public datasets. In our proposed model, we replaced the ordinary convolution with the Ghost module to significantly reduce the number of parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs) due to cheap operations of the Ghost module. We then constructed the Mobile Inverted Residual Bottleneck Convolution and integrated the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the YOLO network to improve its performance on feature extraction. Finally, an extra prediction head was added to detect extra large objects. We tested our method on the ALDOD testing set. Results showed that our method outperformed other state-of-the-art methods with the highest mAP of 89.3%, the smallest model size of only 10.34 MB and the highest frames per second (FPS) of 84.1 on the GPU server. The proposed model was also tested on a mobile phone, which achieved 12.5 FPS. In addition, by applying image augmentation techniques on the dataset, mAP of our method was further improved to 94.0%. These results suggest that our model can accurately and efficiently detect apple leaf diseases and can be used for real-time detection of apple leaf diseases on mobile devices.",

            "title": "Deep Learning Based Detector YOLOv5 for Identifying Insect Pests",
            "abstract": "Insect pests are a major element influencing agricultural production. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), an estimated 20–40% of pest damage occurs each year, which reduces global production and becomes a major challenge to crop production. These insect pests cause sooty mold disease by sucking the sap from the crop’s organs, especially leaves, fruits, stems, and roots. To control these pests, pesticides are frequently used because they are fast-acting and scalable. Due to environmental pollution and health awareness, less use of pesticides is recommended. One of the salient approaches could be to reduce the wide use of pesticides by spraying on demand. To perform spot spraying, the location of the pest must first be determined. Therefore, the growing population and increasing food demand emphasize the development of novel methods and systems for agricultural production to address environmental concerns and ensure efficiency and sustainability. To accurately identify these insect pests at an early stage, insect pest detection and classification have recently become in high demand. Thus, this study aims to develop an object recognition system for the detection of crops damaging insect pests and their classification. The current work proposes an automatic system in the form of a smartphone IP- camera to detect insect pests from digital images/videos to reduce farmers’ reliance on pesticides. The proposed approach is based on YOLO object detection architectures including YOLOv5 (n, s, m, l, and x), YOLOv3, YOLO-Lite, and YOLOR. For this purpose, we collected 7046 images in the wild under different illumination and background conditions to train the underlying object detection approaches. We trained and test the object recognition system with different parameters from scratch. The eight models are compared and analyzed. The experimental results show that the average precision (AP@0.5) of the eight models including YOLO-Lite, YOLOv3, YOLOR, and YOLOv5 with five different scales (n, s, m, l, and x) reach 51.7%, 97.6%, 96.80%, 83.85%, 94.61%, 97.18%, 97.04%, and 98.3% respectively. The larger the model, the higher the average accuracy of the detection validation results. We observed that the YOLOv5x model is fully functional and can correctly identify the twenty-three species of insect pests at 40.5 milliseconds (ms). The developed model YOLOv5x performs the state-of-the-art model with an average precision value of (mAP@0.5) 98.3%, (mAP@0.5:0.95) value of 79.8%, precision of 94.5% and a recall of 97.8%, and F1-score with 96% on our IP-23 dataset. The results show that the system works efficiently and was able to correctly detect and identify insect pests, which can be employed for realistic application while farming.",

            "title": "Pest-YOLO: A model for large-scale multi-class dense and tiny pest detection and counting",
            "abstract": "Frequent outbreaks of agricultural pests can reduce crop production severely and restrict agricultural production. Therefore, automatic monitoring and precise recognition of crop pests have a high practical value in the process of agricultural planting. In recent years, pest recognition and detection have been rapidly improved with the development of deep learning-based methods. Although certain progress has been made in the research on pest detection and identification technology based on deep learning, there are still many problems in the production application in a field environment. This work presents a pest detector for multi-category dense and tiny pests named the Pest-YOLO. First, the idea of focal loss is introduced into the loss function using weight distribution to improve the attention of hard samples. In this way, the problems of hard samples arose from the uneven distribution of pest populations in a dataset and low discrimination features of small pests are relieved. Next, a non-Intersection over Union bounding box selection and suppression algorithm, the confluence strategy, is used. The confluence strategy can eliminate the errors and omissions of pest detection caused by occlusion, adhesion and unlabeling among tiny dense pest individuals to the greatest extent. The proposed Pest-YOLO model is verified on a large-scale pest image dataset, the Pest24, which includes more than 20k images with over 190k pests labeled by agricultural experts and categorized into 24 classes. Experimental results show that the Pest-YOLO can obtain 69.59% for mAP and 77.71% for mRecall on the 24-class pest dataset, which is 5.32% and 28.12% higher than the benchmark model YOLOv4. Meanwhile, our proposed model is superior to other several state-of-the-art methods, including the SSD, RetinaNet, Faster RCNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOX, DETR, TOOD, YOLOv3-W, and AF-RCNN detectors.

            "abstract": "Identifying corn diseases under field conditions is crucial for implementing effective disease management systems. Deep learning (DL)-based plant disease identification using deep neural networks (DNN) has been successfully implemented in recent years. Recent work suggests DL models trained on lab-acquired image data do not generalize to similar accuracy levels for identifying diseases in the field. Additionally, most studies have not evaluated the generalizability of DL models for identifying plant diseases from various datasets and diverse imaging conditions. This study evaluates how well DL models generalize across different datasets and environmental conditions for identifying plant diseases using five datasets consisting of foliar disease images in corn: namely PlantVillage, PlantDoc, Digipathos, northern leaf blight (NLB) dataset, and a custom acquired CD&S dataset. Multiple DL-based image classification models were trained and evaluated using different dataset combinations. Transfer learning was utilized using five different pre-trained DNN architectures: InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16, DesneNet169, and Xception, for conducting four different experiments. After training the models, images for distinct corn diseases from different datasets were used as testing data for evaluating the generalization ability of each DL model. It was observed that the DenseNet169 model performed the best. The highest generalization accuracy of 81.60% was observed when the DenseNet169 model was trained using red, green, blue, and alpha (RGBA) images from CD&S corn disease dataset with removed backgrounds. In addition, 77.50% to 80.33% accuracy was achieved for the PlantVillage dataset when combined with field-acquired images from either the PlantDoc or the CD&S dataset. The results suggest that background removal using RGBA images from CD&S dataset or augmentation of field and lab data improves the generalization performance of DL models and could be used for developing field-deployable disease management systems.",

Pests and diseases destroy plants or parts of plants, leading to lower agricultural production and food insecurity. Pathogen and pest infestations are major causes of crop destruction and loss of crop yields as most farmers do not have access to pathologists and entomologists or sufficient information and infrastructure to identify the disease early on and reduce the loss. To address this, we used a plant leaf dataset containing healthy and diseased plant leave images. These data sets are freely and publicly available to be used. And by using Machine learning and Computer Vision to identify to train the classifier, classify and predict the health of the plant. Using this method, we detect different kinds of disease present in the plant at an early stage before it spreads on a higher scale and a large part of the field is infected and accordingly take action to reduce the amount of loss. The Random Forest model used in this study achieves an overall accuracy rate of 95% on the specified test images.

            "abstract": "The latest generation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has achieved impressive results in the field of image classification. This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves, with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge, this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images in order to create a database, assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe, a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre, was used to perform the deep CNN training. The experimental results on the developed model achieved precision between 91% and 98%, for separate class tests, on average 96.3%.",

In order to minimize the disease induced damage in crops during growth, harvest and postharvest processing, as well as to maximize productivity and ensure agricultural sustainability, advanced disease detection and prevention in crops are imperative. This paper reviews the direct and indirect disease identification methods currently used in agriculture. Laboratory-based techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescence (IF), fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry (FCM) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) are some of the direct detection methods. Indirect methods include thermography, fluorescence imaging and hyperspectral techniques. Finally, the review also provides a comprehensive overview of biosensors based on highly selective bio-recognition elements such as enzyme, antibody, DNA/RNA and bacteriophage as a new tool for the early identification of crop diseases.",

Accurate identification and diagnosis of plant diseases are very important in the era of climate change and globalization for food security as well as prevention of the spread of invasive pests/pathogens. In addition, for an efficient and economical management of plant diseases accurate, sensitive and specific diagnosis is necessary. The science of plant disease diagnosis has evolved from visual inspection and identification of plant diseases to detect with high-throughput serological techniques like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). With the applications of bioinformatics in plant pathology, identification of specific motifs, DNA sequences has become possible, which ultimately increase the accuracy of modern techniques in plant disease diagnosis. Though advances have been made in every aspect of diagnosis of plant diseases; increasing sensitivity and specificity have remained the key area for development.

It is currently playing a vital role in the early detection and classification of plant diseases. The use of ML techniques in this field is viewed as having brought considerable improvement in cultivation productivity sectors, particularly with the recent emergence of DL, which seems to have increased accuracy levels. Recently, many DL architectures have been implemented accompanying visualisation techniques that are essential for determining symptoms and classifying plant diseases. This review investigates and analyses the most recent methods, developed over three years leading up to 2020, for training, augmentation, feature fusion and extraction, recognising and counting crops, and detecting plant diseases, including how these methods can be harnessed to feed deep classifiers and their effects on classifier accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Past studies of plant disease and pest recognition used classification methods that presented a singular recognition result to the user. Unfortunately, incorrect recognition results may be output, which may lead to further crop damage. To address this issue, there is a need for a system that suggest several candidate results and allow the user to make the final decision. In this study, we propose a method for diagnosing plant diseases and identifying pests using deep features based on transfer learning. To extract deep features, we employ pre-trained VGG and ResNet 50 architectures based on the ImageNet dataset, and output disease and pest images similar to a query image via a k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. In this study, we use a total of 23,868 images of 19 types of hot-pepper diseases and pests, for which, the proposed model achieves accuracies of 96.02 and 99.61%, respectively. We also measure the effects of fine-tuning and distance metrics. The results show that the use of fine-tuning-based deep features increases accuracy by approximately 0.7–7.38%, and the Bray–Curtis distance achieves an accuracy of approximately 0.65–1.51% higher than the Euclidean distance.",

            "title": "Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks",
            "abstract": "Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a “better” basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact).",

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

There are a wide variety of plant pests, with wide distribution, fast reproduction and large quantity, which directly causes serious losses to crops. Therefore, pest recognition is very important for crops to grow healthily, and this in turn affects crop yields and quality. At present, it is a great challenge to realize accurate and reliable pest identification.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn this study, we put forward a diagnostic system based on transfer learning for pest detection and recognition. This method is able to train and test ten types of pests and achieves an accuracy of 93.84%. We compared this transfer learning method with human experts and a traditional neural network model. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to human experts and the traditional neural network. To verify the general adaptability of this model, we used our model to recognize two types of weeds: Sisymbrium sophia and Procumbent Speedwell, and achieved an accuracy of 98.92%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe proposed method can provide evidence for the control of pests and weeds and the precise spraying of pesticides.

Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.",

Determining the optimal root zone temperature condition in a hydroponic system during cultivation could lead to an improvement in plant growth. An optimal control strategy can be determined by identifying the eco-physiological process using a dynamic model. However, it is difficult to develop a dynamic model of the responses of plant growth to root zone temperature because the eco-physiological processes of plants are quite complicated. We propose an intelligent approach that can deal with this complex system. Non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural networks were used to develop a dynamic model of the responses of plant growth to root zone temperature. The responses of chili pepper plant growth as affected by root zone temperature were measured during 60 days of cultivation inside a growth chamber using a non-destructive and continuous system based on a load cell. Five datasets of dynamic responses of plant growth were obtained for system identification. The results suggest that the application of a neural network is useful for modeling the dynamic response of plant growth to root zone temperature in hydroponic cultivation, with promising performance.",

        "title": "Plant disease detection using leaf images and an involutional neural network",
        "abstract": "The human population and domestic animals rely heavily on agriculture for their food and livelihood. Agriculture is an important contributor to the national economy of many countries. Plant diseases lead to a significant reduction in agricultural yield, posing a threat to global food security. It is crucial to detect plant diseases in a timely manner to prevent economic losses. Expert diagnosis and pathogen analysis are widely used for the detection of diseases in plants. However, both expert diagnosis and pathogen analysis rely on the real-time investigation experience of experts, which is prone to errors. In this work, an image analysis-based method is proposed for detecting and classifying plant diseases using an involution neural network and self-attention-based model. This method uses digital images of plant leaves and identifies diseases on the basis of image features. Different diseases affect leaf characteristics in different ways; therefore, their visual patterns are highly useful in disease recognition. For rigorous evaluation of the method, leaf images of different crops, including apple, grape, peach, cherry, corn, pepper, potato, and strawberry, are taken from a publicly available PlantVillage dataset to train the developed model. The experiments are not performed separately for different crops; instead, the model is trained to work for multiple crops. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performed well, with an average classification accuracy of approximately 98.73% (κ = 98.04) for 8 different crops with 23 classes. The results are also compared with those of several existing methods, and it is found that the proposed method outperforms the other methods considered in this work.",

            "abstract": "UAV based traffic monitoring holds distinct advantages over traditional traffic sensors, such as loop detectors, as UAVs have higher mobility, wider field of view, and less impact on the observed traffic. For traffic monitoring from UAV images, the essential but challenging task is vehicle detection. This paper extends the framework of Faster R-CNN for car detection from low-altitude UAV imagery captured over signalized intersections. Experimental results show that Faster R-CNN can achieve promising car detection results compared with other methods. Our tests further demonstrate that Faster R-CNN is robust to illumination changes and cars’ in-plane rotation. Besides, the detection speed of Faster R-CNN is insensitive to the detection load, that is, the number of detected cars in a frame; therefore, the detection speed is almost constant for each frame. In addition, our tests show that Faster R-CNN holds great potential for parking lot car detection. This paper tries to guide the readers to choose the best vehicle detection framework according to their applications. Future research will be focusing on expanding the current framework to detect other transportation modes such as buses, trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles.",

            "abstract": "Due to the high demand for mango and being the king of all fruits, it is the need of the hour to curb its diseases to fetch high returns. Automatic leaf disease segmentation and identification are still a challenge due to variations in symptoms. Accurate segmentation of the disease is the key prerequisite for any computer-aided system to recognize the diseases, i.e., Anthracnose, apicalnecrosis, etc., of a mango plant leaf. To solve this issue, we proposed a CNN based Fully-convolutional-network (FrCNnet) model for the segmentation of the diseased part of the mango leaf. The proposed FrCNnet directly learns the features of each pixel of the input data after applying some preprocessing techniques. We evaluated the proposed FrCNnet on the real-time dataset provided by the mango research institute, Multan, Pakistan. To evaluate the proposed model results, we compared the segmentation performance with the available state-of-the-art models, i.e., Vgg16, Vgg-19, and Unet. Furthermore, the proposed model’s segmentation accuracy is 99.2% with a false negative rate (FNR) of 0.8%, which is much higher than the other models. We have concluded that by using a FrCNnet, the input image could learn better features that are more prominent and much specific, resulting in an improved and better segmentation performance and diseases’ identification. Accordingly, an automated approach helps pathologists and mango growers detect and identify those diseases.",

However, as convolution is channel-specific, the potential cross-channel correlations in images are often neglected. This paper proposes a novel model, namely I-CNet, which leverages involution and convolution for improving the accuracy of image classification tasks, by extracting feature representations on both channel domain and spatial domain. The proposed I-CNet has been experimented on three image classification datasets. The experimental results show that involution component employed in I-CNet model can effectively represent cross-channel features in images and I-CNet is superior to other comparatives with higher classification accuracy achieved on all the three datasets.",

Mechanical vibration is generally used in soybean seed sorting, which will seriously damage soybean seeds. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been considered to be an effective method for location and segmentation tasks. However, CNN requires a large amount of ground truth data and high computational cost.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFirst, we propose a self-supervision manner to automatically generate ground truths, which can theoretically create an almost unlimited number of labeled images. Second, instead of using popular CNNs, a novel invertible convolution (involution) enabled scheme is proposed by using the bottleneck block of the residual networks. Third, a Feature Selection Feature Pyramid Network (FS-FPN) based on involution is designed, which selects features more flexible and adaptive. We further merge involution-based backbones and FS-FPN into a unified network, achieving an end-to-end seed location and segmentation model, the best mean average precision (mAP) of location and segmentation achieve 85.1% and 81%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method greatly improves the performance of the baseline network with faster speed and fewer parameters, making it available to detect the soybean seeds more effectively.

            "abstract": "Plant diseases are a severe cause of crop losses in the agriculture globally. Detection of diseases in plants is difficult and challenging due to the lack of expert knowledge. Deep learning-based models provide promising ways to identify plant diseases using leaf images. However, need of larger training sets, computational complexity, and overfitting, etc. are the major issues with these techniques that still need to be addressed. In this work, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed that consists of smaller number of layers leading to lower computational burden. Some augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are applied to generate additional samples increasing the training set without actually capturing more images. The CNN model is trained for apple crop using a publicly available dataset PlantVillage to identify Scab, Black rot, and Cedar rust diseases in apple leaves. The rigorous experimental results revealed that the proposed model is well fit to identify apple leaf diseases and achieves 98% classification accuracy. It is also evident from the results that it needs lesser amount of storage and takes smaller execution time than several existing deep CNN models. Although, there exist several CNN models for crop disease detection with comparable accuracy, but the proposed model needs lower storage and computational resources. Therefore, it is highly suitable for deploying in handheld devices.",

To develop this system, construction of a stepwise disease detection model using images of diseased-healthy plant pairs and a CNN algorithm consisting of five pre-trained models. The disease detection model consists of three step classification models, crop classification, disease detection, and disease classification. The ‘unknown’ is added into categories to generalize the model for wide application. In the validation test, the disease detection model classified crops and disease types with high accuracy (97.09%). The low accuracy of non-model crops was improved by adding these crops to the training dataset implicating expendability of the model. Our model has the potential to apply to smart farming of Solanaceae crops and will be widely used by adding more various crops as training dataset.",

Plant diseases can reduce food production and affect food security. Worldwide crop loss due to plant disease is estimated to be around 14.1%. The lack of proper identification of plant disease at the early stages of infection can result in inappropriate disease control measures. Therefore, the automatic identification and diagnosis of plant diseases are highly recommended. Lack of availability of large amounts of data that are not processed to a large extent is one of the main challenges in plant disease diagnosis. In the current manuscript, we developed datasets for food grains specifically for rice, wheat, and maize to address the identified challenges. The developed datasets consider the common diseases (two bacterial diseases and two fungal diseases of rice, four fungal diseases of maize, and four fungal diseases of wheat) that affect crop yields and cause damage to the whole plant. The datasets developed were applied to eight fine-tuned deep learning models with the same training hyperparameters. The experimental results based on eight fine-tuned deep learning models show that, while recognizing maize leaf diseases, the models Xception and MobileNet performed best with a testing accuracy of 0.9580 and 0.9464 respectively. Similarly, while recognizing the wheat leaf diseases, the models MobileNetV2 and MobileNet performed best with a testing accuracy of 0.9632 and 0.9628 respectively. The Xception and Inception V3 models performed best, with a testing accuracy of 0.9728 and 0.9620, respectively, for recognizing rice leaf diseases. The research also proposes a new convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained from scratch on all three food grain datasets developed. The proposed model performs well and shows a testing accuracy of 0.9704, 0.9706, and 0.9808 respectively on the maize, rice, and wheat datasets.",

Image-based deep learning methods are cutting-edge technologies that can facilitate the diagnosis of diseases efficiently and effectively when large-scale dataset is available for training. However, there is not a public dataset about tobacco currently. A comprehensive dataset is appealed to take advantage of deep learning methods in tobacco cultivation urgently. In this paper, we propose to create a specific dataset for tobacco diseases, called Tobacco Plant Disease Dataset (TPDD). 2721 tobacco leaf images are taken in field. The dataset serves for two purposes: disease classification and leaf detection. For classification, we identify 12 classes and provide two types of disease annotations: 1) Whole Leaf Section; 2) Disease Fragment Section. For leaf detection, we provide two kinds of bounding box: rectangle bounding box and polygon bounding box. In addition, we conduct baseline experiments to illustrate the usefulness of TPDD: 1) using deep learning model to detect single disease and multiple diseases; 2) using YOLO-v3 and Mask-RCNN to detect leaves. We hope that the dataset could support the tobacco industry, also be a benchmark in fine-grained vision classification.",

In order to solve such problems, methods based on machine learning can be used. In recent years, deep learning, which is especially widely used in image processing, offers many new applications related to precision agriculture. In this study, we evaluated the performance results using different approaches of nine powerful architectures of deep neural networks for plant disease detection. Transfer learning and deep feature extraction methods are used, which adapt these deep learning models to the problem at hand. The utilized pretrained deep models are considered in the presented work for feature extraction and for further fine-tuning. The obtained features using deep feature extraction are then classified by support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) methods. The experiments are carried out using data consisting of real disease and pest images from Turkey. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score are all calculated for performance evaluation. The evaluation results show that deep feature extraction and SVM/ELM classification produced better results than transfer learning. In addition, the fc6 layers of the AlexNet, VGG16, and VGG19 models produced better accuracy scores when compared to the other layers.",

            "abstract": "— China is the largest country in the world for planting sunflower, and sunflower is an important cash crop in Chinese agriculture. Sunflower diseases are becoming more and more serious, accurate identification and effective control of sunflower diseases are very important for local economic development in China. Traditionally, sunflower disease identification is mainly based on the eye recognition method, which has great limitations and this way is difficult to meet the development needs of modern agriculture. In recent years, with the rapid development of digital image processing technology and computer technology, it provides a new platform for development of sunflower disease identification system. This paper proposes a sunflower leaf disease identification method based on SIFT points mainly for sunflower leaf diseases. In-depth study was conducted on sunflower black spot, bacterial leaf spot, powdery mildew and downy mildew.",

        "abstract": "Problems with crop production and plants are common in India, affecting rural farmers, the agriculture industry, and the economy as a whole. Leaf plays a significant role in Plants and Crops because, depending on its condition, it provides information in advance about the quantity and quality of agricultural yield. This study has proposed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm based disease classification, pesticide recommendation and pre-processing of leaf images obtained from a plant village dataset. After expanding the plant leaf image’s data set through geometric manipulation, the extended dataset is separated into a train dataset and a test dataset. After that, the large ImageNet image data set is used to train the ResNet-50 models. In this study, the pre-learned data model constraints are conveyed to the lesser model image dataset of plant infections to train the leaf diseases, pest recognition, and pesticides recommendation model founded on the concept of transfer learning. On a number of diseased leaves, this method is tested. The results of experiments demonstrate that using the transfer learning-based CNN method will improve the higher accuracy and performance efficiency for plant sprig image detection. It is capable of rapidly and precisely diagnosing crop diseases, reducing pesticide and fertilizer use, and increasing crop yield and quality.",

Two approaches for creating additional training samples are data warping, which generates additional samples through transformations applied in the data-space, and synthetic over-sampling, which creates additional samples in feature-space. We experimentally evaluate the benefits of data augmentation for a convolutional backpropagation-trained neural network, a convolutional support vector machine and a convolutional extreme learning machine classifier, using the standard MNIST handwritten digit dataset. We found that while it is possible to perform generic augmentation in feature-space, if plausible transforms for the data are known then augmentation in data-space provides a greater benefit for improving performance and reducing overfitting.",

The identification of plants by conventional keys is complex, time consuming, and due to the use of specific botanical terms frustrating for non-experts. This creates a hard to overcome hurdle for novices interested in acquiring species knowledge. Today, there is an increasing interest in automating the process of species identification. The availability and ubiquity of relevant technologies, such as, digital cameras and mobile devices, the remote access to databases, new techniques in image processing and pattern recognition let the idea of automated species identification become reality. This paper is the first systematic literature review with the aim of a thorough analysis and comparison of primary studies on computer vision approaches for plant species identification. We identified 120 peer-reviewed studies, selected through a multi-stage process, published in the last 10 years (2005–2015). After a careful analysis of these studies, we describe the applied methods categorized according to the studied plant organ, and the studied features, i.e., shape, texture, color, margin, and vein structure. Furthermore, we compare methods based on classification accuracy achieved on publicly available datasets. Our results are relevant to researches in ecology as well as computer vision for their ongoing research. The systematic and concise overview will also be helpful for beginners in those research fields, as they can use the comparable analyses of applied methods as a guide in this complex activity.",

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",

            "abstract": "\n The timely, rapid, and accurate near real-time observations are urgent to monitor the damage of corn armyworm, because the rapid expansion of armyworm would lead to severe yield losses. Therefore, the potential of machine learning algorithms for identifying the armyworm infected areas automatically and accurately by multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) dataset is explored in this study. And the study area is in Beicuizhuang Village, Langfang City, Hebei Province, which is the main corn-producing area in the North China Plain.\n Firstly, we identified the optimal combination of image features by Gini-importance and the comparation of four kinds of machine learning methods including Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was done. And RF was proved to be the most potential with the highest Kappa and OA of 0.9709 and 0.9850, respectively. Secondly, the armyworm infected areas and healthy corn areas were predicted by an optimized RF model in the UAV dataset, and the armyworm incidence levels were classified subsequently. Thirdly, the relationship between the spectral characteristics of different bands and pest incidence levels within the Sentinel-2 and UAV images were analyzed, and the B3 in UAV images and the B6 in Sentinel-2 image were less sensitive for armyworm incidence levels. So the Sentinel-2 image was used to monitor armyworm in two towns.\n The optimized dataset and RF model are effective and reliable, which can be used for identifying the corn damage by armyworm using UAV images accurately and automatically in field-scale.

            "abstract": "When detecting tomato leaf diseases in natural environments, factors such as changes in lighting, occlusion, and the small size of leaf lesions pose challenges to detection accuracy. Therefore, this study proposes a tomato leaf disease detection method based on attention mechanisms and multi-scale feature fusion. Firstly, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is introduced into the backbone feature extraction network to enhance the ability to extract lesion features and suppress the effects of environmental interference. Secondly, shallow feature maps are introduced into the re-parameterized generalized feature pyramid network (RepGFPN), constructing a new multi-scale re-parameterized generalized feature fusion module (BiRepGFPN) to enhance feature fusion expression and improve the localization ability for small lesion features. Finally, the BiRepGFPN replaces the Path Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (PAFPN) in the YOLOv6 model to achieve effective fusion of deep semantic and shallow spatial information. Experimental results indicate that, when evaluated on the publicly available PlantDoc dataset, the model’s mean average precision (mAP) showed improvements of 7.7%, 11.8%, 3.4%, 5.7%, 4.3%, and 2.6% compared to YOLOX, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv6-s, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8, respectively. When evaluated on the tomato leaf disease dataset, the model demonstrated a precision of 92.9%, a recall rate of 95.2%, an F1 score of 94.0%, and a mean average precision (mAP) of 93.8%, showing improvements of 2.3%, 4.0%, 3.1%, and 2.7% respectively compared to the baseline model. These results indicate that the proposed detection method possesses significant detection performance and generalization capabilities.",

            "abstract": "Tomato cultivation is increasingly widespread, yet it faces significant challenges, particularly from plant diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, and insects. Addressing these diseases is crucial for ensuring the quality and yield of tomato crops. To support specialists in accurately identifying and managing these diseases, we propose an advanced automatic system for detecting and identifying tomato leaf diseases using sophisticated image processing techniques. Therefore, we proposed an approach that employs robust feature extraction methods, including the gray level co‐occurrence matrix (GLCM) and scale‐invariant feature transform (SIFT), coupled with a support vector machine (SVM) for adequate classification. We curated an extensive dataset of 2700 tomato leaf images, with a minimum of 300 images for each of the nine distinct disease classes. This comprehensive dataset facilitated the training and testing of various machine learning and deep learning models. The experimental results highlight our proposed approach’s exceptional accuracy and reliability, significantly improving the detection and classification of tomato leaf diseases. A thorough comparative analysis with contemporary state‐of‐the‐art techniques further validates the superiority of our system. Our findings suggest that this framework can significantly benefit tomato cultivation by enabling timely and precise disease management. Future research can explore integrating advanced deep learning algorithms to enhance the system’s accuracy in this multiclass classification challenge.",

We also present a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier based on the AlexNet architecture. Preprocessing was done on hyperspectral imaging data to improve image quality and retrieve pertinent characteristics. A large dataset was used to train and verify the classifiers, and the results showed excellent disease detection accuracy.

Therefore, the fundamental guiding the control of disease proliferation is the effective diagnosis of diseases induced in plants at an early stage. This work put forward a convolutional neural network using transfer learning to perform cassava disease detection. The proposed approach has undergone substantial training and testing on cassava leaf images containing five distinct classes. After a pre-processing step using a contrast enhancement technique, oversampling techniques combined with data augmentation methods are used on the dataset to counter the high-class imbalance. Because not all data in the actual world is balanced, efficient categorization of unbalanced data is an important area of study. Experimental results demonstrate that the balanced dataset has increased the model accuracy by 4.3%. The proposed methodology achieved an accuracy score of 94.02% when data augmentation techniques were coupled with oversampling techniques.",

Novel methods of cassava disease detection are needed to support improved control which will prevent this crisis. Image recognition offers both a cost effective and scalable technology for disease detection. New deep learning models offer an avenue for this technology to be easily deployed on mobile devices. Using a dataset of cassava disease images taken in the field in Tanzania, we applied transfer learning to train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases and two types of pest damage (or lack thereof). The best trained model accuracies were 98% for brown leaf spot (BLS), 96% for red mite damage (RMD), 95% for green mite damage (GMD), 98% for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), and 96% for cassava mosaic disease (CMD). The best model achieved an overall accuracy of 93% for data not used in the training process. Our results show that the transfer learning approach for image recognition of field images offers a fast, affordable, and easily deployable strategy for digital plant disease detection.",

It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of oversampling the minority (abnormal)cla ss and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)tha n only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space)t han varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC)and the ROC convex hull strategy.",

We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks. In post-competition work, we establish a new state of the art for the detection task. Finally, we release a feature extractor from our best model called OverFeat.",

In scenarios where a CNN is deployed on mobile devices, models are presented with new challenges due to lighting and orientation. It is essential for model assessment to be conducted in real world conditions if such models are to be reliably integrated with computer vision products for plant disease phenotyping. We train a CNN object detection model to identify foliar symptoms of diseases in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). We then deploy the model in a mobile app and test its performance on mobile images and video of 720 diseased leaflets in an agricultural field in Tanzania. Within each disease category we test two levels of severity of symptoms-mild and pronounced, to assess the model performance for early detection of symptoms. In both severities we see a decrease in performance for real world images and video as measured with the F-1 score. The F-1 score dropped by 32% for pronounced symptoms in real world images (the closest data to the training data) due to a decrease in model recall. If the potential of mobile CNN models are to be realized our data suggest it is crucial to consider tuning recall in order to achieve the desired performance in real world settings. In addition, the varied performance related to different input data (image or video) is an important consideration for design in real world applications.",

            "abstract": "\n Background: Melanoma is a type of skin cancer with a higher mortality compared to other types of skin cancers. Early and accurate diagnosis of melanoma has critical importance on its prognosis. Recently, deep neural network based models dominated the CAD systems for classification of the potential melanoma lesions. In clinical settings, capturing impeccable skin images is not always possible. In some cases, an external object such as a ruler is required for determination of lesion size. Sometimes, the skin images can be blurry, noisy or have low contrast. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of external objects (ruler, hair) and image quality (blur, noise, contrast) on the classification of melanoma using commonly used Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) models.Results: Performance is analyzed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision metrics over 6 different test sets. Hair set has 89.22%, ruler set has 86% and none set has 88.81% as the best accuracy with DenseNet121 architecture. Also, DenseNet has the best average accuracy with comparing the other three models in other datasets, which are noise and blur. We find that ResNet is better for contrast dataset. We can infer that DenseNet can be used for melanoma classification with image distortions and degradations. Conclusion: In this study, we investigate the effect of ruler/hair and image blur, noise and contrast on the melanoma detection performance of four commonly used CNN models: ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16 and AlexNet. Melanoma images can be better recognized under contrast changes unlike the benign images, we recommend ResNet model whenever there is contrast issue. Noise significantly degrades the performance on melanoma images and the recognition rates decrease with compared to benign lesions in noisy set. DenseNet121 also works well in this set. Both classes are sensitive to blur changes and best accuracy is obtained with DenseNet model. The images contain ruler has decreased the classification accuracy and ResNet has better performance if there is ruler in an image. Hairy images have the best success rate in our system since it has the maximum number of images in total dataset. DenseNet performs better for both hairy and high quality images.",

            "title": "Cassava disease recognition from low‐quality images using enhanced data augmentation model and deep learning",
            "abstract": "Improvement of deep learning algorithms in smart agriculture is important to support the early detection of plant diseases, thereby improving crop yields. Data acquisition for machine learning applications is an expensive task due to the requirements of expert knowledge and professional equipment. The usability of any application in a real‐world setting is often limited by unskilled users and the limitations of devices used for acquiring images for classification. We aim to improve the accuracy of deep learning models on low‐quality test images using data augmentation techniques for neural network training. We generate synthetic images with a modified colour value distribution to expand the trainable image colour space and to train the neural network to recognize important colour‐based features, which are less sensitive to the deficiencies of low‐quality images such as those affected by blurring or motion. This paper introduces a novel image colour histogram transformation technique for generating synthetic images for data augmentation in image classification tasks. The approach is based on the convolution of the Chebyshev orthogonal functions with the probability distribution functions of image colour histograms. To validate our proposed model, we used four methods (resolution down‐sampling, Gaussian blurring, motion blur, and overexposure) for reducing image quality from the Cassava leaf disease dataset. The results based on the modified MobileNetV2 neural network showed a statistically significant improvement of cassava leaf disease recognition accuracy on lower‐quality testing images when compared with the baseline network. The model can be easily deployed for recognizing and detecting cassava leaf diseases in lower quality images, which is a major factor in practical data acquisition.",

        "title": "Detection: A convolutional network method for plant disease recognition",
        "abstract": "Within the last decade and a half, ConvNet models have shown increasingly impressive performances on image classification tasks. The continuous quest for better performing ConvNet models is of great importance in that it provides an avenue for the development of superior models which would serve to improve many much-needed services to humankind in domains such as crop pest and disease detection. This paper proposes a feature extraction ConvNet, called Detection, with aim to improve plant disease recognition. Detection contains four convolutional layers, four batch normalization layers and two max-pooling layers. For reference, its plant disease recognition performance was compared with the feature extraction layers for AlexNet, LeNet-5, ZFNet and VGGNet on four datasets from PlantVillage: bacterial spot disease (bell pepper), late blight disease (tomato), leaf mold disease (tomato) and yellow leaf curl disease (tomato). Prior to ablation testing, it achieved the second-highest overall classification accuracy over all four disease recognition datasets (65.50%) after AlexNet (84.33%). However, ablation tests revealed that the removal of the second convolutional layer from the network resulted in a 24.08% increase in overall accuracy on all four disease recognition datasets, up from 65.50% accuracy without the ablation. This surpassed AlexNet's overall accuracy on all four disease recognition datasets (84.33%) by 5.25%. Also, the removal of the second pooling layer from the network resulted in a 23.33% increase in overall accuracy on all four disease recognition datasets, up from 65.50% accuracy without the ablation. This also surpassed AlexNet's overall accuracy on all four disease recognition datasets (84.33%) by 4.40%. The results suggest that the proposed feature extraction ConvNet is a performant method for plant disease recognition.",

Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. \nThrough extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. \nWe interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.",

            "abstract": "Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.",

One one hand, massive trainable parameters significantly enhance the performance of these deep networks. One the other hand, they bring the problem of over-fitting. To this end, dropout based methods disable some elements in the output feature maps during the training phase for reducing the co-adaptation of neurons. Although the generalization ability of the resulting models can be enhanced by these approaches, the conventional binary dropout is not the optimal solution. Therefore, we investigate the empirical Rademacher complexity related to intermediate layers of deep neural networks and propose a feature distortion method for addressing the aforementioned problem. In the training period, randomly selected elements in the feature maps will be replaced with specific values by exploiting the generalization error bound. The superiority of the proposed feature map distortion for producing deep neural network with higher testing performance is analyzed and demonstrated on several benchmark image datasets.",

This layer drastically reduces the spatial dimension of input. It serves two main purposes. The first is to reduce the number of parameters or weights, thus lessening the computational cost. The second is to control the overfitting of the network. An ideal pooling method is expected to extract only useful information and discard irrelevant details.

These factors make it difficult to detect potato leaf diseases in the early stage. Various machine learning techniques have been developed to detect potato leaf diseases. However, the existing methods cannot detect crop species and crop diseases in general because these models are trained and tested on images of plant leaves of a specific region. In this research, a multi-level deep learning model for potato leaf disease recognition has developed. At the first level, it extracts the potato leaves from the potato plant image using the YOLOv5 image segmentation technique. At the second level, a novel deep learning technique has been developed using a convolutional neural network to detect the early blight and late blight potato diseases from potato leaf images. The proposed potato leaf disease detection model was trained and tested on a potato leaf disease dataset. The potato leaf disease dataset contains 4062 images collected from the Central Punjab region of Pakistan. The proposed deep learning technique achieved 99.75% accuracy on the potato leaf disease dataset. The performance of the proposed techniques was also evaluated on the PlantVillage dataset. The proposed technique is also compared with the state-of-the-art models and achieved significantly concerning the accuracy and computational cost.",

            "abstract": "Purpose To investigate the impact of the following three methodological pitfalls on model generalizability: (a) violation of the independence assumption, (b) model evaluation with an inappropriate performance indicator or baseline for comparison, and (c) batch effect. Materials and Methods The authors used retrospective CT, histopathologic analysis, and radiography datasets to develop machine learning models with and without the three methodological pitfalls to quantitatively illustrate their effect on model performance and generalizability. F1 score was used to measure performance, and differences in performance between models developed with and without errors were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test when applicable. Results Violation of the independence assumption by applying oversampling, feature selection, and data augmentation before splitting data into training, validation, and test sets seemingly improved model F1 scores by 71.2% for predicting local recurrence and 5.0% for predicting 3-year overall survival in head and neck cancer and by 46.0% for distinguishing histopathologic patterns in lung cancer. Randomly distributing data points for a patient across datasets superficially improved the F1 score by 21.8%. High model performance metrics did not indicate high-quality lung segmentation. In the presence of a batch effect, a model built for pneumonia detection had an F1 score of 98.7% but correctly classified only 3.86% of samples from a new dataset of healthy patients. Conclusion Machine learning models developed with these methodological pitfalls, which are undetectable during internal evaluation, produce inaccurate predictions; thus, understanding and avoiding these pitfalls is necessary for developing generalizable models.

        "abstract": "Plant disease outbreaks have a profound impact on the agricultural sector, leading to substantial economic implications, compromised crop yields and quality, and potential food scarcity. Consequently, the development of effective disease prevention and management strategies is crucial. This study introduces a novel methodology employing deep learning for the identification and diagnosis of plant diseases, with a focus on mitigating the associated detrimental effects. In this investigation, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were utilized to devise a disease identification method applicable to three types of plant leaves - peppers (two classes), potato (three classes), and tomato (nine classes). Preprocessing techniques, including image resizing and data augmentation, were adopted to facilitate the analysis. Additionally, three distinct feature extraction methods - Haralick feature, Histogram of Gradient (HOG), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) - were implemented. The Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) technique was employed as a feature selection strategy to identify the most advantageous features. This approach diverges from traditional methodologies that solely rely on CNNs for feature extraction, instead extracting features from the dataset through multiple extractors and passing them to the GWO for selection, followed by CNN classification. The proposed method demonstrated high efficiency, with classification accuracies reaching up to 99.8% for pepper, 99.9% for potato, and 95.7% for tomato. This study thus provides a progressive shift in plant disease detection, offering promising potential for improving agricultural health management. In conclusion, the integration of deep learning and the Grey Wolf Optimization technique presents a compelling approach for plant disease detection, demonstrating high accuracy and efficiency. This research contributes a significant advancement",

Second, human can discern thousands of color shades and intensities, compared to about only two dozen shades of gray. In RGB model, each color appears in its primary spectral components of red, green and blue. This model is based on Cartesian coordinate system. Images represented in RGB color model consist of three component images. One for each primary, when fed into an RGB monitor, these three images combines on the phosphor screen to produce a composite color image. The number of bits used to represent each pixel in RGB space is called the pixel depth. Consider an RGB image in which each of the red, green and blue images is an 8-bit image. Under these conditions each RGB color pixel is said to have a depth of 24 bit. MATLAB 7.0 2007b was used for the implementation of all results.",

Despite numerous applications in oncology and medical imaging in general, there is no consensus regarding texture analysis workflow, or reporting of parameter settings crucial for replication of results. The aim of this study was to assess how sensitive Haralick texture features of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) MR images are to changes in five parameters related to image acquisition and pre-processing: noise, resolution, how the ADC map is constructed, the choice of quantization method, and the number of gray levels in the quantized image. We found that noise, resolution, choice of quantization method and the number of gray levels in the quantized images had a significant influence on most texture features, and that the effect size varied between different features. Different methods for constructing the ADC maps did not have an impact on any texture feature. Based on our results, we recommend using images with similar resolutions and noise levels, using one quantization method, and the same number of gray levels in all quantized images, to make meaningful comparisons of texture feature results between different subjects.",

The images were processed with different filters such as medianBlur and gaussianblur for the elimination of noise, the add Weighted filter was used for the enhancement of details in the images. The images were compiled by the authors of this work, since there was no accessible database of this specific kind of fruit, for which we visited Valle and Pampa farm so we could take pictures of different blueberry leaves, labeled in three different tags: diseased, plagued and healthy. The extraction of characteristics was done with algorithms such as HOG (Histogram of oriented gradients) and LBP (Local binary patterns), both normalized and not normalized. The results of the model showed an 84% accuracy index using Deep Learning, this model was able to classify whether the blueberry plant was being affected or not. The result of this work provides a solution to a constant problem in the agricultural sector that affects the production of blueberries, because pests as well as diseases are constant problems in this sector.",

Even though it can be treated relatively easily with good sanitation, proper pruning and copper spraying, the main issue is the early detection for the prevention of spreading. Machine learning algorithms can offer the tools for the on-site classification of healthy and affected leaves, as an initial step towards managing such diseases. The purpose of this study was to build a robust convolutional neural network (CNN) model that is able to classify images of leaves, depending on whether or not these are infected by anthracnose, and therefore determine whether a tree is infected. A set of images were used both in grayscale and RGB mode, a fast Fourier transform was implemented for feature extraction, and a CNN architecture was selected based on its performance. Finally, the best performing method was compared with state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures.",

            "abstract": "Traditional systems of handwriting recognition have relied on handcrafted features and a large amount of prior knowledge. Training an Optical character recognition (OCR) system based on these prerequisites is a challenging task. Research in the handwriting recognition field is focused around deep learning techniques and has achieved breakthrough performance in the last few years. Still, the rapid growth in the amount of handwritten data and the availability of massive processing power demands improvement in recognition accuracy and deserves further investigation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are very effective in perceiving the structure of handwritten characters/words in ways that help in automatic extraction of distinct features and make CNN the most suitable approach for solving handwriting recognition problems. Our aim in the proposed work is to explore the various design options like number of layers, stride size, receptive field, kernel size, padding and dilution for CNN-based handwritten digit recognition. In addition, we aim to evaluate various SGD optimization algorithms in improving the performance of handwritten digit recognition. A network’s recognition accuracy increases by incorporating ensemble architecture. Here, our objective is to achieve comparable accuracy by using a pure CNN architecture without ensemble architecture, as ensemble architectures introduce increased computational cost and high testing complexity. Thus, a CNN architecture is proposed in order to achieve accuracy even better than that of ensemble architectures, along with reduced operational complexity and cost. Moreover, we also present an appropriate combination of learning parameters in designing a CNN that leads us to reach a new absolute record in classifying MNIST handwritten digits. We carried out extensive experiments and achieved a recognition accuracy of 99.87% for a MNIST dataset.",

Disease attacks are constant threats to agriculture and cause heavy losses in the country’s economy. Therefore, early detection can mitigate the severity of diseases and protect crops. However, manual disease identification is both time-consuming and error prone, and requires a thorough knowledge of plant pathogens. Instead, automated methods save both time and effort. This paper presents a contemporary overview of research undertaken over the past decade in the field of disease identification of different crops using machine learning, deep learning, image processing techniques, the Internet of Things, and hyperspectral image analysis. Additionally, a comparative study of several techniques applied to crop disease detection was carried out. Furthermore, this paper discusses the different challenges to be overcome and possible solutions. Then, several suggestions to address these challenges are provided. Finally, this research provides a future perspective that promises to be a highly useful and valuable resource for researchers working in the field of crop disease detection.",

The recent revolution in smartphone penetration and computer vision models has created an opportunity for image classification in agriculture. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are considered state-of-the-art in image recognition and offer the ability to provide a prompt and definite diagnosis. In this paper, the performance of a pre-trained ResNet34 model in detecting crop disease is investigated. The developed model is deployed as a web application and is capable of recognizing 7 plant diseases out of healthy leaf tissue. A dataset containing 8,685 leaf images; captured in a controlled environment, is established for training and validating the model. Validation results show that the proposed method can achieve an accuracy of 97.2% and an F1 score of greater than 96.5%. This demonstrates the technical feasibility of CNNs in classifying plant diseases and presents a path towards AI solutions for small holder farmers.",

To improve the identification accuracy of maize leaf diseases and reduce the number of network parameters, the improved GoogLeNet and Cifar10 models based on deep learning are proposed for leaf disease recognition in this paper. Two improved models that are used to train and test nine kinds of maize leaf images are obtained by adjusting the parameters, changing the pooling combinations, adding dropout operations and rectified linear unit functions, and reducing the number of classifiers. In addition, the number of parameters of the improved models is significantly smaller than that of the VGG and AlexNet structures. During the recognition of eight kinds of maize leaf diseases, the GoogLeNet model achieves a top - 1 average identification accuracy of 98.9%, and the Cifar10 model achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%. The improved methods are possibly improved the accuracy of maize leaf disease, and reduced the convergence iterations, which can effectively improve the model training and recognition efficiency.",

        "title": "Towards Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Hard-sample Re-mining Strategy",
        "abstract": "With rich annotation information, object detection-based automated plant disease diagnosis systems (e.g., YOLO-based systems) often provide advantages over classification-based systems (e.g., EfficientNet-based), such as the ability to detect disease locations and superior classification performance. One drawback of these detection systems is dealing with unannotated healthy data with no real symptoms present. In practice, healthy plant data appear to be very similar to many disease data. Thus, those models often produce mis-detected boxes on healthy images. In addition, labeling new data for detection models is typically time-consuming. Hard-sample mining (HSM) is a common technique for re-training a model by using the mis-detected boxes as new training samples. However, blindly selecting an arbitrary amount of hard-sample for re-training will result in the degradation of diagnostic performance for other diseases due to the high similarity between disease and healthy data. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective training strategy called hard-sample re-mining (HSReM), which is designed to enhance the diagnostic performance of healthy data and simultaneously improve the performance of disease data by strategically selecting hard-sample training images at an appropriate level. Experiments based on two practical in-field eight-class cucumber and ten-class tomato datasets (42.7K and 35.6K images) show that our HSReM training strategy leads to a substantial improvement in the overall diagnostic performance on large-scale unseen data. Specifically, the object detection model trained using the HSReM strategy not only achieved superior results as compared to the classification-based state-of-the-art EfficientNetV2-Large model and the original object detection model, but also outperformed the model using the HSM strategy in multiple evaluation metrics.",

The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

            "abstract": "State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available",

            "abstract": "Practical automated detection and diagnosis of plant disease from wide-angle images (i.e. in-field images containing multiple leaves using a fixed-position camera) is a very important application for large-scale farm management, in view of the need to ensure global food security. However, developing automated systems for disease diagnosis is often difficult, because labeling a reliable wide-angle disease dataset from actual field images is very laborious. In addition, the potential similarities between the training and test data lead to a serious problem of model overfitting. In this paper, we investigate changes in performance when applying disease diagnosis systems to different scenarios involving wide-angle cucumber test data captured on real farms, and propose an effective diagnostic strategy. We show that leading object recognition techniques such as SSD and Faster R-CNN achieve excellent end-to-end disease diagnostic performance only for a test dataset that is collected from the same population as the training dataset (with F1-score of 81.5% – 84.1% for diagnosed cases of disease), but their performance markedly deteriorates for a completely different test dataset (with F1-score of 4.4 – 6.2%). In contrast, our proposed two-stage systems using independent leaf detection and leaf diagnosis stages attain a promising disease diagnostic performance that is more than six times higher than end-to-end systems (with F1-score of 33.4 – 38.9%) on an unseen target dataset. We also confirm the efficiency of our proposal based on visual assessment, concluding that a two-stage model is a suitable and reasonable choice for practical applications.",

In this paper, we propose an improved vision-based method of detecting strawberry diseases using a deep neural network (DNN) capable of being incorporated into an automated robot system. In the proposed approach, a backbone feature extractor named PlantNet, pre-trained on the PlantCLEF plant dataset from the LifeCLEF 2017 challenge, is installed in a two-stage cascade disease detection model. PlantNet captures plant domain knowledge so well that it outperforms a pre-trained backbone using an ImageNet-type public dataset by at least 3.2% in mean Average Precision (mAP). The cascade detector also improves accuracy by up to 5.25% mAP. The results indicate that PlantNet is one way to overcome the lack-of-annotated-data problem by applying plant domain knowledge, and that the human-like cascade detection strategy effectively improves the accuracy of automated disease detection methods when applied to strawberry plants.",

            "abstract": "Image-based autonomous diagnosis for plants is a difficult task since plant symptoms are visually subtle. This subtlety leads to the system overfitting as it sometimes responds to non-essential parts in images such as background or sunlight conditions. Thus, this causes a significant drop in performance when diagnosing diseases in different test fields. Several data augmentation methods utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proposed to address this overfitting problem. However, performance improvement is limited due to the limited variety of generated images. This study proposes a productive and pathogenic image generation (PPIG) technique, a framework for generating varied and quality plant images to train the diagnostic systems. PPIG is comprised of two phases: the bulk production phase and the pathogenic phase. In the first phase, a number of healthy leaf images are generated to form the basis for the generation of disease images. Then, in the second phase, the symptomatic characteristics are added to the leaf part of the generated healthy images. In this study, we conducted experiments to evaluate PPIG using test images taken in different fields from the training images, assuming six disease classes of cucumber leaves. The proposed PPIG can generate natural-looking, healthy and disease images, and data augmentation using these images effectively improved the robustness of the diagnostic system. Experiments on 8,834 test images taken in different fields from 53,045 training images show that our proposal improved the disease diagnostic performance from the baseline by 9.4% for the macro-average F1-score. Moreover, it also outperformed the previous cutting-edge data augmentation methodology by 4.5%.",

            "abstract": "Citrus psyllid is the only insect vector of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), which is the most destructive disease in the citrus industry. There is no effective treatment for HLB, so detecting citrus psyllids as soon as possible is the key prevention measure for citrus HLB. It is time-consuming and laborious to search for citrus psyllids through artificial patrol, which is inconvenient for the management of citrus orchards. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, a computer vision method instead of the artificial patrol can be adopted for orchard management to reduce the cost and time. The citrus psyllid is small in shape and gray in color, similar to the stem, stump, and withered part of the leaves, leading to difficulty for the traditional target detection algorithm to achieve a good recognition effect. In this work, in order to make the model have good generalization ability under outdoor light condition, a high-definition camera to collect data set of citrus psyllids and citrus fruit flies under natural light condition was used, a method to increase the number of small target pests in citrus based on semantic segmentation algorithm was proposed, and the cascade region-based convolution neural networks (R-CNN) (convolutional neural network) algorithm was improved to enhance the recognition effect of small target pests using multiscale training, combining CBAM attention mechanism with high-resolution feature retention network high-resoultion network (HRNet) as feature extraction network, adding sawtooth atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) structure to fully extract high-resolution features from different scales, and adding feature pyramid networks (FPN) structure for feature fusion at different scales. To mine difficult samples more deeply, an online hard sample mining strategy was adopted in the process of model sampling. The results show that the improved cascade R-CNN algorithm after training has an average recognition accuracy of 88.78% for citrus psyllids. Compared with VGG16, ResNet50, and other common networks, the improved small target recognition algorithm obtains the highest recognition performance. Experimental results also show that the improved cascade R-CNN algorithm not only performs well in citrus psylla identification but also in other small targets such as citrus fruit flies, which makes it possible and feasible to detect small target pests with a field high-definition camera.",

In addition to the ViT, the classical convolutional neural network (CNN) methods and the combination of CNN and ViT have been implemented for the plant disease classification. The models have been trained and evaluated on multiple datasets. Based on the comparison between the obtained results, it is concluded that although attention blocks increase the accuracy, they decelerate the prediction. Combining attention blocks with CNN blocks can compensate for the speed.",

In this article, augmented plant leaf disease datasets was developed using basic image manipulation and deep learning based image augmentation techniques such as Image flipping, cropping, rotation, color transformation, PCA color augmentation, noise injection, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Neural Style Transfer (NST) techniques. Performance of the data augmentation techniques was studied using state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques, for instance, VGG16, ResNet, and InceptionV3. An extensive simulation shows that the augmented dataset using GAN and NST techniques achieves better accuracy than the original dataset using a basic image manipulation based augmented dataset. Furthermore, a combination of Deep learning, Color, and Position augmentation dataset gives the maximum classification performance than all other datasets.",

Recent methods for such problems typically train feed-forward convolutional neural networks using a per-pixel loss between the output and ground-truth images. Parallel work has shown that high-quality images can be generated by defining and optimizing perceptual loss functions based on high-level features extracted from pretrained networks. We combine the benefits of both approaches, and propose the use of perceptual loss functions for training feed-forward networks for image transformation tasks. We show results on image style transfer, where a feed-forward network is trained to solve the optimization problem proposed by Gatys et al. in real-time. Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster. We also experiment with single-image super-resolution, where replacing a per-pixel loss with a perceptual loss gives visually pleasing results.",

Unlike most work on generative models, our primary goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood to test data, nor do we require the model to be able to learn well without using any labels. Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.",

The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.",

Despite a very rich research activity leading to numerous interesting GAN algorithms, it is still very hard to assess which algorithm(s) perform better than others. We conduct a neutral, multi-faceted large-scale empirical study on state-of-the art models and evaluation measures. We find that most models can reach similar scores with enough hyperparameter optimization and random restarts. This suggests that improvements can arise from a higher computational budget and tuning more than fundamental algorithmic changes. To overcome some limitations of the current metrics, we also propose several data sets on which precision and recall can be computed. Our experimental results suggest that future GAN research should be based on more systematic and objective evaluation procedures. Finally, we did not find evidence that any of the tested algorithms consistently outperforms the non-saturating GAN introduced in \\cite{goodfellow2014generative}.",

Despite the amazing results, the principle of neural style transfer, especially why the Gram matrices could represent style remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretation of neural style transfer by treating it as a domain adaptation problem. Specifically, we theoretically show that matching the Gram matrices of feature maps is equivalent to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with the second order polynomial kernel. Thus, we argue that the essence of neural style transfer is to match the feature distributions between the style images and the generated images. To further support our standpoint, we experiment with several other distribution alignment methods, and achieve appealing results. We believe this novel interpretation connects these two important research fields, and could enlighten future researches.",

Emotion classification is such an example of imbalanced label distribution, because some classes of emotions like \\emph{disgusted} are relatively rare comparing to other labels like {\\it happy or sad}. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GAN). It can complement and complete the data manifold and find better margins between neighboring classes. Specifically, we design a framework with a CNN model as the classifier and a cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN) as the generator. In order to avoid gradient vanishing problem, we employ the least-squared loss as adversarial loss. We also propose several evaluation methods on three benchmark datasets to validate GAN's performance. Empirical results show that we can obtain 5%~10% increase in the classification accuracy after employing the GAN-based data augmentation techniques.",

Pesticides are frequently misused, resulting in inefficient pest control. For small farmers, the lack of information is even more damaging due to the little support received from government agencies. Many systems to detect plant diseases through images exist nowadays, aiding phytopathology specialists in diagnosing crops. Those systems use computer vision and machine learning to classify diseases through photos of leaves and fruits. However, proper diagnosis involves many intermediary steps, such as symptom classification and disease agent recognition. This work emphasizes the pioneering utility of multi-task learning within digital decision support systems specifically designed for crop clinics. We propose to build a single model capable of dealing with multiple tasks from a single input, being those the indication if a leaf is healthy or not, which symptoms it has, and if the disease is caused by fungi or not, along with a pipeline to make use of its outputs through a mobile app.",

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

Good quality disease severity data should be accurate (close to the true value). Earliest quantification of disease severity was by visual estimates. Sensor-based image analysis including visible spectrum and hyperspectral and multispectral sensors are established technologies that promise to substitute, or complement visual ratings. Indeed, these technologies have measured disease severity accurately under controlled conditions but are yet to demonstrate their full potential for accurate measurement under field conditions. Sensor technology is advancing rapidly, and artificial intelligence may help overcome issues for automating severity measurement under hyper-variable field conditions. The adoption of appropriate scales, training, instruction and aids (standard area diagrams) has contributed to improved accuracy of visual estimates. The apogee of accuracy for visual estimation is likely being approached, and any remaining increases in accuracy are likely to be small. Due to automation and rapidity, sensor-based measurement offers potential advantages compared with visual estimates, but the latter will remain important for years to come. Mobile, automated sensor-based systems will become increasingly common in controlled conditions and, eventually, in the field for measuring plant disease severity for the purpose of research and decision making.",

        "abstract": "Farming is one vital sector in all countries' economic and developmental life worldwide, and agriculture contributes so much to food security and livelihood. However, crop and root diseases significantly constrain agricultural production, compromising yields to about 14% globally annually. Plant diseases may ruin crops, leading to substantial economic losses, low-quality food consumed, and lower yields. Early diagnosis of plant diseases is crucial for crop health and production. Farmers used a laborious and time-consuming traditional way of detecting diseases through eye observation for a long time. Agriculture has evolved into more efficient practices; precision agriculture (PA) is a technology that minimizes farmers' accuracy with various losses. However, PA remains in its developmental stage, particularly with technological progress and the discovery of plant disease detection. The development of automated systems in plant disease diagnosis was one of the promising advancements in modern agriculture based on techniques for image-based information. This study uses a CNN model to identify and classify plant diseases in pictures from the Plant Village Dataset. The best accuracy results that the custom CNN obtained on training, validation, and test data were 93%, 90%, and 90%. These results infer that CNN is a good classifier for classifying plant diseases into two categories.",

These require careful diagnosis and timely handling to protect the crops from heavy losses. Now a day’s crop faces many diseases. The naked eye observation of experts is the main approach adopted in practice for detection and identification of cotton plant diseases. But, this needs continuous monitoring of experts which might be prohibitively expensive in large farms. So automatic detection of cotton plant diseases are an important research topic as it may prove benefits in monitoring large field of crops, and thus automatically detect diseases from symptoms that appear on plant leaves. For detecting diseases on the cotton early and accurately we can use image processing technique.

To overcome this problem early disease identification, classification and detection is required. Recently, deep learning is very popular object recognition and detection. Convolution Neural Network id part of deep learning which is widely used in object detection part. In these different architectures of Convolution Neural Network are used to classify 10 classes of tomato disease. This paper used AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet, DenseNet-121, and ResNet-lOl for classification of tomato leaves. The dataset used is publicly available PlantVillage dataset. DenseNet-121, VGG16 and ResNet-lOl performs almost equal in terms of accuracy, precision, Fl-score, and Recall. Size of DenseNet-121 is only 89.6MB which is very smaller than ResNet-lOl and all other models.",

Plant disease can be identified from the leaves as the texture, color and spots are different from healthy leaves. Conventional method of observing the leaves require expertise. So development of plant disease detection using Deep Learning techniques such as transfer learning can help the farmers who lack expertise and resources to hire the expert. In this study, ResNet50 with Transfer Learning is used for disease identification of potato, tomato and corn. Performance of ResNet50 is compared with VGG16 and MCNN built and trained from scratch. ResNet50 achieved highest performance of 98.7% for plant disease identification. 16 classes of different plant diseases can be identified in the model. Work can be extended by training model on more classes.",

        "title": "DETECTION OF MULTIPLE PLANT DISEASE USING DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING",
        "abstract": "For detecting the incidence and quantifying the severity of variability in crops, image-based plant disease detection is one of the most important activities in precision agriculture. Pathogen-caused diseases account for 70 percent to 80 percent of the variabilities, with 60 percent to 70 percent appearing on the leaves compared to the stem and fruits. This study uses leaf image data to conduct a comparative comparison of model implementation for plant disease diagnosis. Until recently, most of these image processing algorithms relied on what some referred to as \"shallow\" machine learning architectures, and some still do. The DL network is quickly becoming the gold standard for image recognition and pattern analysis research. Regardless, there aren't many research on its use in detecting disease in plant leaves. Thus, we used conventional settings and took into account the three critical elements of architecture, processing capacity, and the amount of training data in our study on a large plant leaf disease picture dataset. In a developing agricultural economy like India, early detection of plant leaf detection is critical. Leaf diseases in plants must be diagnosed at an early stage and predictive techniques implemented to make them safe and avoid losses to the agri-based economy, not only as an agricultural economy but also as one with a big population to feed. This work proposes to identify Leaf disease utilising image processing techniques based on image segmentation, clustering, and image detection algorithms, all of which contribute to a reliable, safe, and accurate leaf disease detection system with specialisation.",

Further dataset is segregated into training and testing subsets. After that plant infection dataset is trained to RESNET-50 model. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, improved accuracy in identifying and classifying diseased leaves, detecting pests, and recommending appropriate pesticides. This innovative system holds promise for enhancing crop management by facilitating rapid and accurate diagnosis, reducing the need for excessive pesticide use, and ultimately elevating crop yield and quality.",

            "title": "Fusion of AI Techniques: A Hybrid Approach for Precise Plant Leaf Disease Classification",
            "abstract": "Classification of plant leaf diseases is an important step in protecting the world's food supply and agricultural yields. There has been encouraging progress in improving the efficiency and accuracy of plant leaf disease diagnosis via the combination of deep learning methods with artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years. This research introduces a new hybrid strategy, CNN+SVM and CNN+RF, that uses deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in conjunction with more traditional machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Moreover, two hybrid variants, CNN + RF and CNN + SVM, are proposed to exploit the strengths of both paradigms synergistically. To further improve classification accuracy, the study employs Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a feature selection technique. PSO optimizes the feature subset for each classification model, facilitating the extraction of the most informative features, which leads to better discrimination between healthy and diseased plants. The dataset used for experimentation consists of a comprehensive collection of plant leaf images representing various diseases across multiple plant species. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed hybrid approach compared to individual classification methods. The hybrid models achieve higher accuracy rates and improved generalization performance, showcasing the synergistic benefits of combining AI and deep learning techniques. Furthermore, the feature selection process through PSO contributes significantly to enhancing the classification outcomes, providing insights into the discriminative power of selected features. This research contributes to the advancement of plant leaf disease classification methodologies by offering an innovative hybrid approach that leverages the complementary strengths of AI, deep learning, and feature selection techniques. The study's findings underscore the potential for improving plant leaf disease management strategies, ultimately leading to enhanced crop productivity and sustainable agriculture. The proposed hybrid framework can serve as a blueprint for similar classification tasks in other domains, demonstrating the broader impact of synergizing different AI techniques for improved accuracy and performance. CNN+RF gives 95% accuracy, 93% precision, 96% recall and 94% F1 score, whereas CNN+SVM gives 93% accuracy, 91% precision, 94% recall and 92% F1 score.",

        "abstract": "Plant pest and disease management is an important factor affecting the yield and quality of crops, and due to the rich variety and the diagnosis process mostly relying on experts’ experience, there are problems of low diagnosis efficiency and accuracy. For this, we proposed a Plant pest and Disease Lightweight identification Model by fusing Tensor features and Knowledge distillation (PDLM-TK). First, a Lightweight Residual Blocks based on Spatial Tensor (LRB-ST) is constructed to enhance the perception and extraction of shallow detail features of plant images by introducing spatial tensor. And the depth separable convolution is used to reduce the number of model parameters to improve the diagnosis efficiency. Secondly, a Branch Network Fusion with Graph Convolutional features (BNF-GC) is proposed to realize image super-pixel segmentation by using spanning tree clustering based on pixel features. And the graph convolution neural network is utilized to extract the correlation features to improve the diagnosis accuracy. Finally, we designed a Model Training Strategy based on knowledge Distillation (MTS-KD) to train the pest and disease diagnosis model by building a knowledge migration architecture, which fully balances the accuracy and diagnosis efficiency of the model. The experimental results show that PDLM-TK performs well in three plant pest and disease datasets such as Plant Village, with the highest classification accuracy and F1 score of 96.19% and 94.94%. Moreover, the model execution efficiency performs better compared to lightweight methods such as MobileViT, which can quickly and accurately diagnose plant diseases.",

The identification of crop disease is one of the widely studied challenges. Crop diseases cannot be accurately predicted by merely analyzing individual disease causes. This proposal presents a fuzzy-logic-based pest prediction mechanism assisting in beforehand preparedness for potential pest prevention. The experiments are performed for pests in rice and millet crops. The data mining over samples collected in a cropping cycle revealed the plausible correlation between temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall with pest breeding. The data collected through IoT monitoring infrastructure is analyzed for the ambient breeding condition of the pest. These conditions are then employed to design the knowledge base of the fuzzy system. More specifically, the linguistic variables of the fuzzy membership function are optimized using a genetic algorithm for close prediction of pest breeding in given environmental conditions. The proposal verified that the weather factors have a strong impact on the occurrence of pests and diseases, and the fuzzy-logic-based pest prediction through IoT application development services will help farmers to take precautionary measures beforehand.",

In recent years, various countries have been increasing investment in agricultural production and actively carrying out agricultural pest control work. Therefore, how effectively realizing pest identification is a top priority at present. Traditional identification methods have disadvantages, such as time-consuming and laborious, untimely diagnosis, and limited diagnosis range. With the development of modern digital technology, image processing technology develops rapidly, which opens up a new way for pest identification. This paper proposes an improved network model for pest identification using the YOLOv5 target detection algorithm. Firstly, the data sets of pests and diseases are collected and marked. Then, an improved anchor frame size is proposed to make it more suitable for the data set used in this paper. Finally, an improved network structure of YOLOv5 is proposed, which improves the ability of the network to capture characteristic information.

The proposed solution is an improvement to the solution proposed in [1] as it provides faster and more accurate solution. The developed processing scheme consists of four main phases as in [1]. The following two steps are added successively after the segmentation phase. In the first step we identify the mostlygreen colored pixels. Next, these pixels are masked based on specific threshold values that are computed using Otsu's method, then those mostly green pixels are masked. The other additional step is that the pixels with zeros red, green and blue values and the pixels on the boundaries of the infected cluster (object) were completely removed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique is a robust technique for the detection of plant leaves diseases. The developed algorithm‟s efficiency can successfully detect and classify the examined diseases with a precision between 83% and 94%, and can achieve 20% speedup over the approach proposed in [1].",

Accurate recognition of insect pests facilitates timely preventive measures to avoid economic losses. However, the existing datasets for the visual classification task mainly focus on common objects, e.g., flowers and dogs. This limits the application of powerful deep learning technology on specific domains like the agricultural field. In this paper, we collect a large-scale dataset named IP102 for insect pest recognition. Specifically, it contains more than 75, 000 images belonging to 102 categories, which exhibit a natural long-tailed distribution. In addition, we annotate about 19, 000 images with bounding boxes for object detection. The IP102 has a hierarchical taxonomy and the insect pests which mainly affect one specific agricultural product are grouped into the same upperlevel category. Furthermore, we perform several baseline experiments on the IP102 dataset, including handcrafted and deep feature based classification methods. Experimental results show that this dataset has the challenges of interand intra- class variance and data imbalance. We believe our IP102 will facilitate future research on practical insect pest control, fine-grained visual classification, and imbalanced learning fields. We make the dataset and pre-trained models publicly available at https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102.",

In many countries, Integrated Pest Management is the most widely used process to prevent and mitigate the damages caused by pests and diseases in citrus crops. However, its results are credited by humans who visually inspect the orchards in order to identify the disease symptoms, insects and mite pests. In this context, we design a weakly supervised learning process guided by saliency maps to automatically select regions of interest in the images, significantly reducing the annotation task. In addition, we create a large citrus pest benchmark composed of positive samples (six classes of mite species) and negative samples. Experiments conducted on two large datasets demonstrate that our results are very promising for the problem of pest and disease classification in the agriculture field.",

Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3× or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pretraining and shows promising scaling behavior.",

        "abstract": "Medicinal plants are widely used in traditional and modern Ayurveda for treating various diseases. However, pest infestation poses a significant challenge to maintaining their health and productivity. This paper proposes a method for detecting pest-infected medicinal plants, which may assist farmers, researchers, and agricultural professionals in identifying infestations early. The study utilizes three datasets of medicinal plants which are Neem, Aloe Vera, and Ashwagandha, and trains five deep learning models such as Basic CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, VGG32, and a newly proposed CFNET. These models process plant image data and predict pest presence using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and training time. The CFNET model, built on the EfficientNetB3 architecture, achieved the highest accuracy of 0.98 on the Neem dataset, 0.94 on Aloe Vera, and 0.96 on Ashwagandha, with a focus on reducing false negatives. The results highlight CFNET's superior performance and efficiency compared to other models. This system demonstrates the potential of deep learning for sustainable pest management in medicinal plant cultivation.",

            "abstract": "Vegetables are one of the main crops in China, and pests are one of the important factors affecting the quality of vegetables. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of vegetable pest images, a vegetable pest image recognition method based on improved VGG convolution neural network is proposed. Based on the VGG16 and VGG19 models, the method optimizes the number of full connection layers, replaces the original SoftMax classifier in VGGNet with the three-label SoftMax classifier, optimizes the structure and parameters of the model, and uses the weight parameters of convolution layer and pooling layer in the pre-training model in transfer learning. Experiments were carried out on the self-expanding data set of vegetable pest images, and the performance of the method was tested. Tensorflow was used to train the network model. The experimental results showed that the pre-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, Inception V3, ResNet50) were trained on the vegetable pest image data set to adapt to the recognition of vegetable pest images. The experimental results also showed that compared with Inception V3 and ResNet50, the recognition accuracy of the pre-trained models using VGG16 and VGG19 were higher, and the test accuracy of the two models were 99.90% and 99.99% respectively. Finally, the methods were compared with the traditional VGG method in self-expanding data sets. The results showed that the accuracy of VGG16 model and VGG19 model were improved from 85.90% and 86.21% to 100% and 100% respectively; the classification accuracy of VGG16 model was improved from 64.02% to 99.90%, and the classification accuracy of VGG19 model was improved from 85.83% to 99.99%, which effectively improved the recognition accuracy.",

If even the suspicion of a pest is found in the crop products after they are exported, not only are the agricultural products returned but the whole batch of crops is destroyed, resulting in extreme crop losses. The species of mealybugs, Coccidae, and Diaspididae, which are the primary pests of the scale insect in Taiwan, can not only lead to serious damage to the plants but also severely affect agricultural production. Hence, to recognize the scale pests is an important task in Taiwan’s agricultural field. In this study, we propose an AI-based pest detection system for solving the specific issue of detection of scale pests based on pictures. Deep-learning-based object detection models, such as faster region-based convolutional networks (Faster R-CNNs), single-shot multibox detectors (SSDs), and You Only Look Once v4 (YOLO v4), are employed to detect and localize scale pests in the picture. The experimental results show that YOLO v4 achieved the highest classification accuracy among the algorithms, with 100% in mealybugs, 89% in Coccidae, and 97% in Diaspididae. Meanwhile, the computational performance of YOLO v4 has indicated that it is suitable for real-time application. Moreover, the inference results of the YOLO v4 model further help the end user. A mobile application using the trained scale pest recognition model has been developed to facilitate pest identification in farms, which is helpful in applying appropriate pesticides to reduce crop losses.",

            "abstract": "With the development of advanced information and intelligence technologies, precision agriculture has become an effective solution to monitor and prevent crop pests and diseases. However, pest and disease recognition in precision agriculture applications is essentially the fine-grained image classification task, which aims to learn effective discriminative features that can identify the subtle differences among similar visual samples. It is still challenging to solve for existing standard models troubled by oversized parameters and low accuracy performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a feature-enhanced attention neural network (Fe-Net) to handle the fine-grained image recognition of crop pests and diseases in innovative agronomy practices. This model is established based on an improved CSP-stage backbone network, which offers massive channel-shuffled features in various dimensions and sizes. Then, a spatial feature-enhanced attention module is added to exploit the spatial interrelationship between different semantic regions. Finally, the proposed Fe-Net employs a higher-order pooling module to mine more highly representative features by computing the square root of the covariance matrix of elements. The whole architecture is efficiently trained in an end-to-end way without additional manipulation. With comparative experiments on the CropDP-181 Dataset, the proposed Fe-Net achieves Top-1 Accuracy up to 85.29% with an average recognition time of only 71 ms, outperforming other existing methods. More experimental evidence demonstrates that our approach obtains a balance between the model’s performance and parameters, which is suitable for its practical deployment in precision agriculture art applications.",

To use deep convolutional neural networks to accurately, efficiently, and losslessly identify weeds in corn fields, a new corn weed identification model, SE-VGG16, is proposed. The SE-VGG16 model uses VGG16 as the basis and adds the SE attention mechanism to realize that the network automatically focuses on useful parts and allocates limited information processing resources to important parts. Then the 3 × 3 convolutional kernels in the first block are reduced to 1 × 1 convolutional kernels, and the ReLU activation function is replaced by Leaky ReLU to perform feature extraction while dimensionality reduction. Finally, it is replaced by a global average pooling layer for the fully connected layer of VGG16, and the output is performed by softmax. The experimental results verify that the SE-VGG16 model classifies corn weeds superiorly to other classical and advanced multiscale models with an average accuracy of 99.67%, which is more than the 97.75% of the original VGG16 model. Based on the three evaluation indices of precision rate, recall rate, and F1, it was concluded that SE-VGG16 has good robustness, high stability, and a high recognition rate, and the network model can be used to accurately identify weeds in corn fields, which can provide an effective solution for weed control in corn fields in practical applications.",

In numerous African countries, it serves as a significant source of carbohydrates. Leaf diseases can sometimes damage cassava crops, constraining overall output and farmers' revenue. The ongoing research on cassava disease is fraught with challenges, including a low detection rate, extended processing time, and inadequate precision. This research employs deep transfer learning with Visual Geometry Group (VGG16) models for the diagnosis of Cassava leaf diseases. An experimental study is conducted on a dataset of 5,656 images of cassava, categorized into four distinct disease classifications. Two of the most sophisticated predictions were generated: one identified the healthy leaf, while the other detected the diseases present on the unhealthy leaf. Our suggested deep transfer learning model attains a promising accuracy of 88% and an F1-score of 82% on the public plant disease dataset from the Kaggle repository, achieved through effective hyperparameter fine-tuning. The results of this study strongly advocate for additional research and practical application of deep learning models in plant disease diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Plant diseases have a significant impact on global food security and agricultural output, hence accurate disease identification is essential to provide appropriate management answers. Since they demand large manual labour and allow room for human errors, plant disease detection techniques based on human processes requires immediate automation. This work presents an improved plant disease classification system based on digital image processing and deep learning techniques, which provides excellent accuracy and operating speed. By means of optimal multi-class classification characteristics, a CNN-based system detects several plant diseases To create stronger models with greater accuracy levels, the system combines noise reduction stages with advanced picture preprocessing techniques for contrast enhancement with data augmentation processes. Operating on a large dataset comprising five distinct plant diseases— Tomato Leaf Mold, Potato Blight and Corn Rust, Apple Scab and Grape Black Rot—the CNN model is based on Because their results span 89% to 94%, experiment results show better performance than more traditional methods. Tests of precision, recall, and F1-score show the model can consistently and successfully identify many illness categories. Since the technology allows real-time disease predictions, it achieves pragmatic field application. The suggested system that automatizes disease detection and diagnosis with accuracy while decreasing manual labour and diagnosis time supports smart agriculture. The next effort intends to expand the data pool to attain greater model robustness and generalised performance, so building advanced architectural systems.",

            "abstract": "Plant disease, especially crop plants, is a major threat to global food security since many diseases directly affect the quality of the fruits, grains, and so on, leading to a decrease in agricultural productivity. Farmers have to observe and determine whether a leaf was infected by naked eyes. This process is unreliable, inconsistent, and error prone. Several works on deep learning techniques for detecting leaf diseases had been proposed. Most of them built their models based on limited resolution images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this research, we aim at detecting early disease on plant leaves with small disease blobs, which can only be detected with higher resolution images, by an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. After a pre-processing step using a contrast enhancement method, all the infested blobs are segmented for the whole dataset. A list of several measurement-based features that represents the blobs are chosen and then selected based on their influences on the model’s performance using a wrapper-based feature selection algorithm, which is built based on a hybrid metaheuristic. The chosen features are used as inputs for an ANN. We compare the results obtained using our methods with another approach using popular CNN models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet-50) enhanced with transfer learning. The ANN’s results are better than those of CNNs using a simpler network structure (89.41% vs 78.64%, 79.92%, and 84.88%, respectively). This shows that our approach can be implemented on low-end devices such as smartphones, which will be of great assistance to farmers on the field.",

Royal). However, the acidity, size and taste of tomato fruits could change with excess nitrogen (N) application. The present study aims at the early detection of nitrogen-rich tomato leaves using hyperspectral imaging techniques in the visible and near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectrum, in order to improve plant nutrition composition at an early growth stage. A 30% over-dose of nitrogen was applied to half of the tomato pots. Five leaves were randomly collected from each pot for 3 days (classes D0, D1, D2 and D3), and images were captured with a hyperspectral camera. A metaheuristic approach of artificial neural networks and the firefly algorithm (ANN-FA) was used to determine the most discriminative wavelengths. Afterwards, a combination of ANN and particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) was used to classify tomato leaves into the four classes. The training/classification process was repeated 200 times, and results indicated that the proposed approach was able to detect the excess of nitrogen even at the first day (D1), with a precision of 92.9%. Considering all the classes, the average correct classification rate was 92.6%, while the best execution achieved 95.5% accuracy. Thus, the method showed a high performance for practical uses.",

In the traditional system, farmers use their naked eyes to identify the disease, which is time-consuming and requires domain knowledge. In addition, the domain experts in many remote areas are not available in time and are expensive. To address the above issues, this study proposed an automatic wheat plant disease classification using combined features and an optimized ensemble learning algorithm. The main objective of the proposed system is to detect and classify the normal vs leaf rust vs nitrogen-deficient in wheat plants. Further, we used 1459 wheat leaf images from a public dataset to evaluate the suggested method. From the experimental results (ACC=96.00% for normal vs nitrogen deficient, ACC=98.25% for normal vs leaf rust and ACC=97.39% for normal vs leaf rust vs nitrogen deficient), it is observed that the suggested ensemble method outperformed the other benchmark machine learning algorithms.",

            "abstract": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations suggests increasing the food supply by 70% to feed the world population by 2050, although approximately one third of all food is wasted because of plant diseases or disorders. To achieve this goal, researchers have proposed many deep learning models to help farmers detect diseases in their crops as efficiently as possible to avoid yield declines. These models are usually trained on personal or public plant disease datasets such as PlantVillage or PlantDoc. PlantVillage is composed of laboratory images captured under laboratory conditions, with one leaf each and a uniform background. The models trained on this dataset have very low accuracies when running on field images with complex backgrounds and multiple leaves per image. To solve this problem, PlantDoc was built using 2,569 field images downloaded from the Internet and annotated to identify the individual leaves. However, this dataset includes some laboratory images and the absence of plant pathologists during the annotation process may have resulted in misclassification. In this study, FieldPlant is suggested as a dataset that includes 5,170 plant disease images collected directly from plantations. Manual annotation of individual leaves on each image was performed under the supervision of plant pathologists to ensure process quality. This resulted in 8,629 individual annotated leaves across the 27 disease classes. We ran various benchmarks on this dataset to evaluate state-of-the-art classification and object detection models and found that classification tasks on FieldPlant outperformed those on PlantDoc.",

            "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence has been used for many applications such as medical, communication, object detection, and object tracking. Maize crop, which is the major crop in the world, is affected by several types of diseases which lower its yield and affect the quality. This paper focuses on this issue and provides an application for the detection and classification of diseases in maize crop using deep learning models. In addition to this, the developed application also returns the segmented images of affected leaves and thus enables us to track the disease spots on each leaf. For this purpose, a dataset of three maize crop diseases named Blight, Sugarcane Mosaic virus, and Leaf Spot is collected from the University Research Farm Koont, PMAS-AAUR at different growth stages on contrasting weather conditions. This data was used for training different prediction models including YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv4, YOLOv5s, YOLOv7s, and YOLOv8n and the reported prediction accuracy was 69.40%, 97.50%, 88.23%, 93.30%, and 99.04% respectively. Results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the YOLOv8n model is higher than the other applied models. This model has shown excellent results while localizing the affected area of the leaf accurately with a higher confidence score. YOLOv8n is the latest model used for the detection of diseases as compared to the other approaches in the available literature. Also, worked on sugarcane mosaic virus using deep learning models has also been reported for the first time. Further, the models with high accuracy have been embedded in a mobile application to provide a real-time disease detection facility for end users within a few seconds. Graphical Abstract",

        "abstract": "In agriculture, plant diseases are mainly accountable for reduction in productivity and leads to huge economic loss. Rice is the essential food crop in Asian countries and it gets easily affected by different kinds of diseases. Because of the advent of computer vision and deep learning (DL) techniques, the rice plant diseases can be detected and reduce the burden of the farmers to save the crops. To achieve this, a new DL based rice plant disease diagnosis is developed using Densely Convolution Neural Network (DenseNet) with multilayer perceptron (MLP), called DenseNet169-MLP. The proposed model aims to classify the rice plant disease into three classes namely Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, and Leaf Smut. Initially, preprocessing takes place in three levels namely channel separation, grayscale conversion, and noise removal using median filtering (MF). Then, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) based segmentation process identifies the diseased portion in the rice plant image. The pretrained DenseNet169 technique is used as a feature extractor and the final layer is replaced by the MLP to perform rice plant disease classification. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been validated against benchmark dataset and the simulation outcome is examined under diverse measures. The obtained results defined the superior results of the DenseNet169-MLP model over the recently presented methods with the maximum accuracy of 97.68%.",

            "abstract": "Significance Plant stress identification based on visual symptoms has predominately remained a manual exercise performed by trained pathologists, primarily due to the occurrence of confounding symptoms. However, the manual rating process is tedious, is time-consuming, and suffers from inter- and intrarater variabilities. Our work resolves such issues via the concept of explainable deep machine learning to automate the process of plant stress identification, classification, and quantification. We construct a very accurate model that can not only deliver trained pathologist-level performance but can also explain which visual symptoms are used to make predictions. We demonstrate that our method is applicable to a large variety of biotic and abiotic stresses and is transferable to other imaging conditions and plants. Current approaches for accurate identification, classification, and quantification of biotic and abiotic stresses in crop research and production are predominantly visual and require specialized training. However, such techniques are hindered by subjectivity resulting from inter- and intrarater cognitive variability. This translates to erroneous decisions and a significant waste of resources. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning framework’s ability to identify and classify a diverse set of foliar stresses in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] with remarkable accuracy. We also present an explanation mechanism, using the top-K high-resolution feature maps that isolate the visual symptoms used to make predictions. This unsupervised identification of visual symptoms provides a quantitative measure of stress severity, allowing for identification (type of foliar stress), classification (low, medium, or high stress), and quantification (stress severity) in a single framework without detailed symptom annotation by experts. We reliably identified and classified several biotic (bacterial and fungal diseases) and abiotic (chemical injury and nutrient deficiency) stresses by learning from over 25,000 images. The learned model is robust to input image perturbations, demonstrating viability for high-throughput deployment. We also noticed that the learned model appears to be agnostic to species, seemingly demonstrating an ability of transfer learning. The availability of an explainable model that can consistently, rapidly, and accurately identify and quantify foliar stresses would have significant implications in scientific research, plant breeding, and crop production. The trained model could be deployed in mobile platforms (e.g., unmanned air vehicles and automated ground scouts) for rapid, large-scale scouting or as a mobile application for real-time detection of stress by farmers and researchers.",

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections&#x2014;one between each layer and its subsequent layer&#x2014;our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance.

This article presents a prototype system for detection and classification of rice diseases based on the images of infected rice plants. This prototype system is developed after detailed experimental analysis of various techniques used in image processing operations. We consider three rice plant diseases namely Bacterial leaf blight, Brown spot, and Leaf smut. We capture images of infected rice plants using a digital camera from a rice field. We empirically evaluate four techniques of background removal and three techniques of segmentation. To enable accurate extraction of features, we propose centroid feeding based K-means clustering for segmentation of disease portion from a leaf image. We enhance the output of K-means clustering by removing green pixels in the disease portion. We extract various features under three categories: color, shape, and texture. We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) for multi-class classification. We achieve 93.33% accuracy on training dataset and 73.33% accuracy on the test dataset. We also perform 5 and 10-fold cross-validations, for which we achieve 83.80% and 88.57% accuracy, respectively.",

Earlier work applied Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were employed to improve accuracy in detecting plant disease. However, the recent development of Deep Learning (DL) was encouraging with regard to accuracy and dependability. Our study intends to enhance the precision as well as the dependability of plant disease symptom diagnosis using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). Additionally, it provides remedial actions and supplements for the affected crop. We implemented the Convolutional Neural Network because of its ability to capture local patterns and spatial relationships in the input data, making them potential for image analysis tasks. The Deep Neural Network can extract high-level features due to the performance of non-linear transformations and also the detection process was more efficient than traditional one. The transfer learning algorithms have improved the accuracy of our model in plant disease detection and recognition, thereby aid to improve the productivity of crops. In our proposed work, CNN architecture along with alternative models including VGG and ResNet, is trained on the dataset and the proposed ResNet model improves the accuracy.",

Farmers lack the knowledge of disease and hence they produce less production. Kisan call centers are available but do not offer service 24*7 and sometimes communication too fail. Farmers are unable to explain disease properly on call need to analysis the image of affected area of disease. Though, images and videos of crops provide better view and agro scientists can provide a better solution to resolve the issues related to healthy crop yet it not been informed to farmers.It is required to note that if the productivity of the crop is not healthy, it has high risk of providing good and healthy nutrition. Due to the improvement and development in technology where devices are smart enough to recognize and detect plant diseases. Recognizing illness can prompt faster treatment in order to lessen the negative impacts on harvest.This paper therefore focus upon plant disease detection using image processing approach This work utilizes an open dataset of 5000 pictures of unhealthy and solid plants, where convolution system and semi supervised techniques are used to characterize crop species and detect the sickness status of 4 distinct classes.",

However, it confronts a major challenge which is plant disease. Around 42% of the world’s total crops are destroyed yearly by diseases. So, the identification of plant disease in an earlier stage is critical for minimizing the use of pesticides and reducing crop loss. This research is focusing on the recognition and classification of various tomato and pepper diseases based on Deep learning techniques. Two Convolutional neural networks (CNN) models Resnet 152 and Resnet 50 are used with and without data augmentation. This technique is used when the datasets are small, it expands the number of training images without adding new images. A self-dataset of 488 images of tomato and pepper diseases leaves are collected in Monastir, Tunisia region under the supervision of an agricultural engineer working in the field of plant protection in the Minister of Agriculture. The trained model with data augmentation gives better results than without applying it.",

        "abstract": "Since the assessment of wheat diseases (e.g., leaf rust and tan spot) via visual observation is subjective and inefficient, this study focused on developing an automatic, objective, and efficient diagnosis approach. For each plant, color, and color-infrared (CIR) images were collected in a paired mode. An automatic approach based on the image processing technique was developed to crop the paired images to have the same region, after which a developed semiautomatic webtool was used to expedite the dataset creation. The webtool generated the dataset from either image and automatically built the corresponding dataset from the other image. Each image was manually categorized into one of the three groups: control (disease-free), disease light, and disease severity. After the image segmentation, handcrafted features (HFs) were extracted from each format of images, and disease diagnosis results demonstrated that the parallel feature fusion had higher accuracy over features from either type of image. Performance of deep features (DFs) extracted through different deep learning (DL) models (e.g., AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet101, GoogLeNet, and Xception) on wheat disease detection was compared, and those extracted by ResNet101 resulted in the highest accuracy, perhaps because deep layers extracted finer features. In addition, parallel deep feature fusion generated a higher accuracy over DFs from a single-source image. DFs outperformed HFs in wheat disease detection, and the DFs coupled with parallel feature fusion resulted in diagnosis accuracies of 75, 84, and 71% for leaf rust, tan spot, and leaf rust + tan spot, respectively. The methodology developed directly for greenhouse applications, to be used by plant pathologists, breeders, and other users, can be extended to field applications with future tests on field data and model fine-tuning.",

Thus, sometimes, a pathogen can become a social threat, as in the case of Xylella fastidiosa and olive trees ( Olea europaea L.) in Salento. Fast and systemic response to threats represents the key to success in stopping pest invasions, and proves a great help in managing lots of data in a short time or coordinating large-scale monitoring coming from applying Information Technology tools. Regarding the field of applications, the advantages provided by new technologies are countless. However, is it the same in agriculture? Electronic identification tools can be applied for plant health management and certification. Treatments, agrochemical management or impact assessment may also be supported by dematerialization of data. Information Technology solution for urban forestry management or traceability of commodities belonging to “Food from Somewhere” regimes were analyzed and compared to protection from pests of a unique tree heritage such as olive trees in Salento.",

            "abstract": "Machine vision technology coupled with uniform illumination is now widely used for automatic sorting and grading of apples and other fruits, but it still does not have satisfactory performance for defect detection because there are a large variety of defects, some of which are difficult to detect under uniform illumination. Structured-illumination reflectance imaging (SIRI) offers a new modality for imaging by using sinusoidally-modulated structured illumination, to obtain two sets of independent images, i.e., direct component (DC), which corresponds to conventional uniform illumination, and amplitude component (AC), which is unique to structured illumination. The objective of this study was to develop machine learning classification algorithms by using DC and AC images and their combinations for enhanced detection of surface and subsurface defects of apples. A multispectral SIRI system under illumination of two phase-shifted sinusoidal patterns was used to acquire near-infrared images from ‘Delicious’ and ‘Golden Delicious’ apples with various types of surface and subsurface defects. DC and AC images were extracted through demodulation of the acquired images, and were then enhanced using bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and subsequent image reconstruction. Defect detection algorithms were developed, by using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), for DC, AC, and ratio (AC divided by DC) images and their combinations. Results showed that AC images were superior to DC images for detecting subsurface defects and DC images were overall better than AC for detecting surface defects, whereas ratio images were comparable to, or better than, DC and AC images for defect detection. The ensemble of DC, AC and even ratio images resulted in significantly better detection accuracies over using them individually. Among the three classifiers, CNN performed the best with 98% detection accuracies for both varieties of apples, followed by SVM and RF. This research demonstrated that SIRI, coupled with a machine learning algorithm, can be a new, versatile and effective modality for fruit defect detection.",

            "abstract": "Foliar diseases and Fusarium head blight (FHB) (caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe) frequently constrain hard winter wheat (HWW) production in the northern Great Plains of North America. Experiments were conducted in North Dakota (ND) to determine the agronomic and economic response of adapted hard winter wheat (HWW; Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to foliarly applied fungicides. Experiments consisted of a factorial combination of winter wheat cultivars (12-18 depending on the year) and fungicides (no fungicide or fungicides applied) and were conducted in five environments from 2005 to 2007. Yield and disease development varied between environments, with the greatest disease pressure occurring in 2005 and the least in 2006. Within an environment and averaged across cultivars, fungicides improved yields by 5.5 to 44.0%. Cultivars differed significantly in their yield in each environment and cultivar by fungicide interactions for yield occurred in four of the five environments. In all but 2005, varieties that were most responsive to fungicides were those with the greatest disease susceptibility. In 2005, the year of the greatest disease pressure, cultivars that were the most responsive to fungicide were those with the best disease tolerance, indicating the value of integrating several control practices when disease pressure is high. Fungicides were very effective in reducing leaf spots and FHB and provided near complete control of leaf rust. Fungicides can be a valuable tool in increasing yields and profitability of winter wheat, especially if disease susceptible cultivars are grown and if disease pressure is only moderate. Combining fungicides with genetic resistance offers the best monetary return when disease pressure is high.",

            "abstract": "Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. In addition to reducing the yield of the crop, the causal pathogens also produce mycotoxins that can contaminate the grain. The development of resistant wheat varieties is one of the best ways to reduce the impact of FHB. To develop such varieties, breeders must expose germplasm lines to the pathogen in the field and assess the disease reaction. Phenotyping breeding materials for resistance to FHB is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive when using conventional protocols. To develop a reliable and cost-effective high throughput phenotyping system for assessing FHB in the field, we focused on developing a method for processing color images of wheat spikes to accurately detect diseased areas using deep learning and image processing techniques. Color images of wheat spikes at the milk stage were collected in a shadow condition and processed to construct datasets, which were used to retrain a deep convolutional neural network model using transfer learning. Testing results showed that the model detected spikes very accurately in the images since the coefficient of determination for the number of spikes tallied by manual count and the model was 0.80. The model was assessed, and the mean average precision for the testing dataset was 0.9201. On the basis of the results for spike detection, a new color feature was applied to obtain the gray image of each spike and a modified region-growing algorithm was implemented to segment and detect the diseased areas of each spike. Results showed that the region growing algorithm performed better than the K-means and Otsu’s method in segmenting diseased areas. We demonstrated that deep learning techniques enable accurate detection of FHB in wheat based on color image analysis, and the proposed method can effectively detect spikes and diseased areas, which improves the efficiency of the FHB assessment in the field.",

Generating enough data to train these models is difficult, however, since only trained experts can accurately identify symptoms. In this study, we describe and implement a two-step method for generating a large amount of high-quality training data with minimal expert input. First, experts located symptoms of northern leaf blight (NLB) in field images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), annotating them quickly at low resolution. Second, non-experts were asked to draw polygons around the identified diseased areas, producing high-resolution ground truths that were automatically screened based on agreement between multiple workers. We then used these crowdsourced data to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), feeding the output into a conditional random field (CRF) to segment images into lesion and non-lesion regions with accuracy of 0.9979 and F1 score of 0.7153. The CNN trained on crowdsourced data showed greatly improved spatial resolution compared to one trained on expert-generated data, despite using only one fifth as many expert annotations. The final model was able to accurately delineate lesions down to the millimeter level from UAV-collected images, the finest scale of aerial plant disease detection achieved to date. The two-step approach to generating training data is a promising method to streamline deep learning approaches for plant disease detection, and for complex plant phenotyping tasks in general.",

In the past five years, imaging approaches have shown great potential for high-throughput plant phenotyping, resulting in more attention paid to imaging-based plant phenotyping. With this increased amount of image data, it has become urgent to develop robust analytical tools that can extract phenotypic traits accurately and rapidly. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest studies using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in plant phenotyping applications. We specifically review the use of various CNN architecture for plant stress evaluation, plant development, and postharvest quality assessment. We systematically organize the studies based on technical developments resulting from imaging classification, object detection, and image segmentation, thereby identifying state-of-the-art solutions for certain phenotyping applications. Finally, we provide several directions for future research in the use of CNN architecture for plant phenotyping purposes.",

            "abstract": "Leaf or brown rust of wheat caused by Puccinia triticina (Pt) is one of the most damaging diseases globally. Considerable progress has been made to control leaf rust through crop protection chemicals and host plant resistance breeding in southern Africa. However, frequent changes in the pathogen population still present a major challenge to achieve durable resistance. Disease surveillance and monitoring of the pathogen have revealed the occurrence of similar races across the region, justifying the need for concerted efforts by countries in southern Africa to develop and deploy more efficient and sustainable strategies to manage the disease. Understanding the genetic variability and composition of Pt is a pre-requisite for cultivar release with appropriate resistance gene combinations for sustainable disease management. This review highlights the variability and distribution of the Pt population, and the current control strategies, challenges and future prospects of breeding wheat varieties with durable leaf rust resistance in southern Africa. The importance of regular, collaborative and efficient surveillance of the pathogen and germplasm development across southern Africa is discussed, coupled with the potential of using modern breeding technologies to produce wheat cultivars with durable resistance.",

The consequences of a plant being affected by a disease can result in a considerable decrease in output, and the experiencing decline in financial losses is a unique consequence of a decline in both the caliber and amount of agricultural goods. To avoid a reduction in agricultural productivity and quantity, it is essential to recognize plant diseases. While enormous acres of crops are being monitored, plant disease detection is receiving an increasing amount of attention. Thus, this is possible by making use of image processing methods for plant disease diagnosis. The major limitation of the existing system is, it only predicts a plant disease, and this work not only detects the plant disease but also recommends a suitable fertilizer. The dataset used in the proposed model contains 16870 images and the model is implemented using a deeper Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The level of accuracy accomplished by the model is 96% for fruit leaves and 89% for vegetable leaves.",

With the rapid development of the smart farming, the identification of plant disease becomes digitalized and data-driven, enabling advanced decision support, smart analyses, and planning. This paper proposes a mathematical model of plant disease detection and recognition based on deep learning, which improves accuracy, generality, and training efficiency. Firstly, the region proposal network (RPN) is utilized to recognize and localize the leaves in complex surroundings. Then, images segmented based on the results of RPN algorithm contain the feature of symptoms through Chan–Vese (CV) algorithm. Finally, the segmented leaves are input into the transfer learning model and trained by the dataset of diseased leaves under simple background. Furthermore, the model is examined with black rot, bacterial plaque, and rust diseases. The results show that the accuracy of the method is 83.57%, which is better than the traditional method, thus reducing the influence of disease on agricultural production and being favorable to sustainable development of agriculture. Therefore, the deep learning algorithm proposed in the paper is of great significance in intelligent agriculture, ecological protection, and agricultural production.",

        "abstract": "Agriculture is important for India. Every year growing variety of crops is at loss due to inefficiency in shipping, cultivation, pest infestation in crop and storage of government-subsidized crops.  There is reduction in production of good crops in both quality and quantity due to Plants being affected by diseases. Hence it is important for early detection and identification of diseases in plants. The proposed methodology consists of collection of Plant leaf dataset, Image preprocessing, Image Augmentation and Neural network training. The dataset is collected from ImageNet for training phase. The CNN technique is used to differentiate the healthy leaf from disease affected leaf. In image preprocessing resizing the image is carried out to reduce the training phase time. Image augmentation is performed in training phase by applying various transformation function on Plant images. The Network is trained by Caffenet deep learning framework. CNN is trained with ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit). The convolution base of CNN generates features from image through the multiple convolution layers and pooling layers. The classifier part of CNN classifies the image based on the features extracted from the convolution base. The classification is performed through the fully connected layers. The performance is measured using 10-fold cross validation function. The final layer uses activation function like softmax to categorize the outputs.",

This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves, with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge, this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images in order to create a database, assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe, a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre, was used to perform the deep CNN training. The experimental results on the developed model achieved precision between 91% and 98%, for separate class tests, on average 96.3%.",

These diseases can be more easily identified by using machine learning approach as compared to manual method. Hence machine learning method can be used to identify the affected leaf images.Images captured by camera will be processed using different image processing technique.

            "abstract": "Abstract. Early and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases is a vital step in the crop protection system. In traditional practices, identification is performed either by visual observation or by testing in laboratory. The visual observation requires expertise and it may vary subject to an individual which may lead to an error while the laboratory test is time consuming and may not be able to provide the results in time. To overcome these issues, image based machine learning approach to detect and classify plant diseases has been presented in literature. We have focused specifically on rice plant (Oryza sativa) disease in this paper. The images of the diseased symptoms in leaves and stems have been captured from the rice field. We have collected a total of 619 rice plant diseased images from the real field condition belong to four classes:(a) Rice Blast (RB), (b) Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB), (c) Sheat Blight (SB) and (d) Healthy Leave (HL). We have used a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network(CNN) as a feature extractor and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. We have obtained encouraging results. The early identification of rice diseases by this approach could be used as a preventive measure well as an early warning system. Further, it could be extended to develop a rice plant disease identification system on real agriculture field.\n",

In this paper, a novel plant disease diagnosis method is proposed for the plants using image processing techniques and SVM classifier. Here, disease diagnosis is carried based on features extracted from the segmented image after pre-processing the image of the leaves which are affected with diseases. Modified color processing detection algorithm (CPDA) is used as segmentation method to extract the features. SVM classifier is trained with a dataset of about 100 images of diseased leaves to identify the diseases like anthracnose, leafspot, leafblight, scab. For disease detection, the performance of proposed segmentation technique is better when compared to the K-means clustering segmentation.",

Image segmentation is the technique of dividing or partitioning an image into parts, called segments. It is mostly useful for applications like image compression or object recognition, because for these types of applications, it is inefficient to process the whole image. So, image segmentation is used to segment the parts from image for further processing. There exist several image segmentation techniques, which partition the image into several parts based on certain image features like pixel intensity value, color, texture, etc. These all techniques are categorized based on the segmentation method used. In this paper the various image segmentation techniques are reviewed, discussed and finally a comparison of their advantages and disadvantages is listed.",

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that combines Stable-Diffusion Models with Vision Transformer (ViT) networks to improve plant disease classification. We first employ Stable-Diffusion Models to generate a large-scale dataset comprising 500K images encompassing 106 species of plants. Subsequently, we utilize these generated images to pre-train a ViT model, leveraging its capacity for capturing global image features. We then fine-tune the pre-trained ViT model on three distinct downstream tasks related to identifying diseases in plants. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in plant disease classification accuracy compared to conventional pre-training methods. Furthermore, all our models and synthetic dataset are public available. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of integrating Stable- Diffusion Models with ViT networks for advancing plant disease diagnosis in agricultural systems.",

            "abstract": "Yellow rust in winter wheat is a widespread and serious fungal disease, resulting in significant yield losses globally. Effective monitoring and accurate detection of yellow rust are crucial to ensure stable and reliable wheat production and food security. The existing standard methods often rely on manual inspection of disease symptoms in a small crop area by agronomists or trained surveyors. This is costly, time consuming and prone to error due to the subjectivity of surveyors. Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mounted with hyperspectral image sensors have the potential to address these issues with low cost and high efficiency. This work proposed a new deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based approach for automated crop disease detection using very high spatial resolution hyperspectral images captured with UAVs. The proposed model introduced multiple Inception-Resnet layers for feature extraction and was optimized to establish the most suitable depth and width of the network. Benefiting from the ability of convolution layers to handle three-dimensional data, the model used both spatial and spectral information for yellow rust detection. The model was calibrated with hyperspectral imagery collected by UAVs in five different dates across a whole crop cycle over a well-controlled field experiment with healthy and rust infected wheat plots. Its performance was compared across sampling dates and with random forest, a representative of traditional classification methods in which only spectral information was used. It was found that the method has high performance across all the growing cycle, particularly at late stages of the disease spread. The overall accuracy of the proposed model (0.85) was higher than that of the random forest classifier (0.77). These results showed that combining both spectral and spatial information is a suitable approach to improving the accuracy of crop disease detection with high resolution UAV hyperspectral images.",

Deep learning (DL) focuses on early disease detection, evaluating the data, extending agricultural disease management, and minimizing crop losses. This research work is mainly focused on using DL methods to design an accurate plant disease localization and detection system. This research paper proposes an integration of the CNN-YOLOv5-based framework for image detection and localization. This advanced deep learning-based framework diagnoses numerous plant diseases in leaves using CNN and YOLOv5 for localizing the disease. The PlantVillage dataset is used in this research work to train and test the proposed model that has integrated diverse species of plants and diseases. From the set of images, the CNN model extracts essential features such as patterns, textures, and structures to differentiate healthy and diseased leaves using the ResNet50 algorithm. The localization process highlights the regions with diseased plants. With over 54,000 labeled leaf images, the proposed research model is trained and tested. The CNN model achieved a detection accuracy of 97.8%, and the YOLOv5 model reached a localization accuracy of 89.6%. Thus, the proposed framework emphasizes more accuracy and efficiency for real-time smart farming applications for disease detection and localization.",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research dedicated to applications of machine learning in agricultural production systems. The works analyzed were categorized in (a) crop management, including applications on yield prediction, disease detection, weed detection crop quality, and species recognition; (b) livestock management, including applications on animal welfare and livestock production; (c) water management; and (d) soil management. The filtering and classification of the presented articles demonstrate how agriculture will benefit from machine learning technologies. By applying machine learning to sensor data, farm management systems are evolving into real time artificial intelligence enabled programs that provide rich recommendations and insights for farmer decision support and action.",

            "abstract": "IoT systems have been facing increasingly sophisticated technical problems due to the growing complexity of these systems and their fast deployment practices. Consequently, IoT managers have to judiciously detect failures (anomalies) in order to reduce their cyber risk and operational cost. While there is a rich literature on anomaly detection in many IoT-based systems, there is no existing work that documents the use of ML models for anomaly detection in digital agriculture and in smart manufacturing systems. These two application domains pose certain salient technical challenges. In agriculture the data is often sparse, due to the vast areas of farms and the requirement to keep the cost of monitoring low. Second, in both domains, there are multiple types of sensors with varying capabilities and costs. The sensor data characteristics change with the operating point of the environment or machines, such as, the RPM of the motor. The inferencing and the anomaly detection processes therefore have to be calibrated for the operating point. In this paper, we analyze data from sensors deployed in an agricultural farm with data from seven different kinds of sensors, and from an advanced manufacturing testbed with vibration sensors. We evaluate the performance of ARIMA and LSTM models for predicting the time series of sensor data. Then, considering the sparse data from one kind of sensor, we perform transfer learning from a high data rate sensor. We then perform anomaly detection using the predicted sensor data. Taken together, we show how in these two application domains, predictive failure classification can be achieved, thus paving the way for predictive maintenance.",

        "abstract": "A nation's economy is primarily reliant on agricultural growth. However, several plant diseases seriously impair crop growth, both in terms of quantity and quality. Due to a lack of subject matter specialists and low contrast data, accurate diagnosis of many diseases by hand is highly difficult and time-consuming. The farm management system is therefore looking for a method for automatically detecting early illnesses. To overcome these challenges and correctly classify the different diseases, an efficient and small deep learning-based framework (E-GreenNet) is proposed. A MobileNetV3Small model is used as the foundation of our end-to-end architecture to produce finely tuned, discriminative, and noticeable features. Furthermore, the new plant composite (PC), plantvillage (PV), and data repository of leaf images (DRLI) datasets are used to independently train our proposed model, and test samples are used to evaluate its actual performance. The suggested model achieved accuracy rates of 1.00 percent, 0.96 percent, and 0.99 percent on the given datasets after a rigorous experimental study. Additionally, a comparative investigation of our proposed technique against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reveals extremely high discriminative scores.",

            "abstract": "Tomato is one of the most essential and consumable crops in the world. Tomatoes differ in quantity depending on how they are fertilized. Leaf disease is the primary factor impacting the amount and quality of crop yield. As a result, it is critical to diagnose and classify these disorders appropriately. Different kinds of diseases influence the production of tomatoes. Earlier identification of these diseases would reduce the disease’s effect on tomato plants and enhance good crop yield. Different innovative ways of identifying and classifying certain diseases have been used extensively. The motive of work is to support farmers in identifying early-stage diseases accurately and informing them about these diseases. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to effectively define and classify tomato diseases. Google Colab is used to conduct the complete experiment with a dataset containing 3000 images of tomato leaves affected by nine different diseases and a healthy leaf. The complete process is described: Firstly, the input images are preprocessed, and the targeted area of images are segmented from the original images. Secondly, the images are further processed with varying hyper-parameters of the CNN model. Finally, CNN extracts other characteristics from pictures like colors, texture, and edges, etc. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model predictions are 98.49% accurate.",

Many scientists and scholars have implemented DL techniques for the detection and prediction of pandemics, IDs and other healthcare-related purposes, these outcomes are with various limitations and research gaps. For the purpose of achieving an accurate, efficient and less complicated DL-based system for the detection and prediction of pandemics, therefore, this study carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) on the detection and prediction of pandemics using DL techniques. The survey is anchored by four objectives and a state-of-the-art review of forty-five papers out of seven hundred and ninety papers retrieved from different scholarly databases was carried out in this study to analyze and evaluate the trend of DL techniques application areas in the detection and prediction of pandemics. This study used various tables and graphs to analyze the extracted related articles from various online scholarly repositories and the analysis showed that DL techniques have a good tool in pandemic detection and prediction. Scopus and Web of Science repositories are given attention in this current because they contain suitable scientific findings in the subject area. Finally, the state-of-the-art review presents forty-four (44) studies of various DL technique performances. The challenges identified from the literature include the low performance of the model due to computational complexities, improper labeling and the absence of a high-quality dataset among others. This survey suggests possible solutions such as the development of improved DL-based techniques or the reduction of the output layer of DL-based architecture for the detection and prediction of pandemic-prone diseases as future considerations.",

It automatically extracts the complex features of different pests from the crop pest images. In this paper, various significant deep learning-based object detection models like SSD, EfficientDet, Faster R-CNN, and CenterNet are implemented based on the Tensorflow Object Detection framework. Several significant networks like MobileNet_V2, ResNet101_V1, Inception_ResNet_V2, EfficientNet, and HourGlass104 are employed as backbone networks for these models to extract the different features of the pests. Object detection models are capable of identifying and locating pests in crops. Initially, these models are pre-trained with the COCO dataset and later be fine-tuned to the target pest dataset of 20 different pest classes. After conducting experiments on these models using the pest dataset, we demonstrate that Faster R-CNN_ResNet101_V1 outperformed every other model and achieved mAP of 74.77% . Additionally, it is developed as a lightweight model, whose size is ∼9 MB, and can detect pest objects in 130 milliseconds per image, allowing it to be used on resources-constrained devices commonly used by farmers.",

In addition, we design a feature fusion module to realize the fusion of features at different depths.

        "abstract": "Pumpkin is a vital crop cultivated globally, and its productivity is crucial for food security, especially in developing regions. Accurate and timely detection of pumpkin leaf diseases is essential to mitigate significant losses in yield and quality. Traditional methods of disease identification rely heavily on subjective judgment by farmers or experts, which can lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for intervention. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning offer promising solutions for automating and improving the accuracy of plant disease detection. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for classifying diseases in pumpkin plant leaves. Using a publicly available dataset of 2000 highresolution images, we evaluate the performance of several CNN architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet, in recognizing five classes: healthy leaves and four common diseases downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease, and bacterial leaf spot. We fine-tuned these pretrained models and conducted hyperparameter optimization experiments. ResNet-34, DenseNet-121, and EfficientNet-B7 were identified as top-performing models, each excelling in different classes of leaf diseases. Our analysis revealed DenseNet-121 as the optimal model when considering both accuracy and computational complexity achieving an overall accuracy of 86%. This study underscores the potential of CNNs in automating disease diagnosis for pumpkin plants, offering valuable insights that can contribute to enhancing agricultural productivity and minimizing economic losses.",

Disease detection plays a vital role in prevention of quantity and quality of the agricultural product. Leaf shows the symptoms by changing color and showing the spots on it. Earlier methodology was manual observation of leaves for diseases that took time and were costly. This paper proposes a software based solution to automatically detect and classify plant leaf diseases by image processing of leaf images. The main aim is to detect the disease in the leaf at an early stage and thus take suitable measures to stop this disease. Features are then extracted from the processed image for classification using tensorflow object detection model. The farmer after uploading an image can click on the predict option which first previews the uploaded image and then predicts the disease type of the crop and outputs the details of disease type, description of the disease, symptoms and the treatment or required amount of fertilization for the diseased leaf. This approach will enhance productivity of crops. The experiments have been performed on the diseased leaf images of grape, potato and tomato of the Plant Village dataset.",

The mixture of increasing worldwide smartphone dispersion and current advances in computer vision made conceivable by deep learning has cemented the way for smartphone-assisted disease identification. Using a public dataset of 9000 images of infected and healthy Tomato leaves collected under controlled conditions, we trained a deep convolutional neural network to identify 5 diseases. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 99.84% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path toward smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.",

            "abstract": "Precision agriculture technology at the hands of smallholder farmers in the developing world is often deemed far-fetched. Low-resource farmers, however, are the most susceptible to negative changes in the environment. Providing these farmers with the right tools to mitigate adversity and to gain greater control of the production process could unlock their potential and support rural communities to meet the increasing global food demand. In this study, a real-time variable rate fertilizer application system was developed and tested as an add-on kit to conventional farm machinery. In the context of low investment costs for smallholder farmers, high user-friendliness and easy installment were the main concerns for the system to be viable. The system used nitrogen (N)-sensors to assess the plant nutrient status on the spot and subsequently adjust the amount of fertilizer deposited according to the plant’s needs. Test bench trials showed that the add-on kit performed well with basic operations, but more precision is required. Variability between N-sensors and metering systems, combined with power fluctuations, created inaccuracies in the resulting application rate. Nevertheless, this work is a stepping stone towards catalyzing the elaboration of more cutting-edge precision solutions to support small-scale farmers to become successful, high producing agro-entrepreneurs.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is the culture of land and rearing of plants to supply food to nourish and enhance life. Different types of plants are farmed every year based on environmental conditions and it is one of the main economic sources in India. These plants are prone to many diseases which hinders normal growth of the plants; these diseases are caused by seasonal changes, environmental variations, and cultivation procedures. To protect the plants from such damages, diseases need to be identified and properly diagnosed on time. Hence, innovation of feasible and powerful methods for identification and classification of plant diseases is an urgent need. There are lots of classifiers which are good in the classification of plant diseases: Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) but only using these methods do not make the best tradeoff between time and accuracy. So to remove this constraint, in this paper we have given an image processing solution to distinguish and classify plant diseases efficiently and accurately. In our proposed method, for classification first, we use back-propagation algorithm to get the weights of neural network (NN) connections and then we optimize these weights using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to come out of the problems like local optima and overfitting which are very common in conventional NN training methods. We have used images of leaves affected by different bacterial and fungal diseases: Alternaria Alternata, Anthracnose, Bacterial Blight and Cercospora Leaf Spot in our experiment and our proposed method achieves 96.2% accuracy.",

        "title": "Improved YOLO-X Model for Tomato Disease Severity Detection using Field Dataset",
        "abstract": "—In the past decade, the field of automatic plant disease detection has undergone significant complexity. Advancements in convolutional neural network in deep learning have enabled the rapid and precise detection of ailments, facilitated the development of effective treatments and ultimately led to higher crop yields. One of the most challenging scenarios in plant disease occurs when multiple diseases manifest on a single leaf, exacerbating the difficulty of diagnosis due to overlapping symptoms. This study addresses these challenges by employing an enhanced YOLO-X model for detection tomato leaf diseases. The technique presented here enhances the Spatial Pyramid Pooling layer in order to extract valuable features from training data of various sizes more efficiently. We were able to increase the model's ability to identify a broader spectrum of disease symptoms by concatenating variables from multiple layers and varying sizes. In addition, we incorporate a large number of connections to increase the generalizability of the design. The application of an IoU-based (Intersection over Union) regression loss function increases the convergence of the network and the precision of the detection. For experimentation, we created a customized dataset consisting of 1220 tomato plant leaf images from various farms in Southern part of India, encompassing overlapping diseases and varying degrees of severity. The dataset includes images of healthy leaves as well as different severity levels of tomato leaf curl and tomato leaf mold stress on a single leaf. Our suggested improved SPP-based YOLO-X model beats the original YOLO-X model, according to experimental findings, which show an improvement in test dataset accuracy and a 73.42% mean Average Precision on field-collected dataset.",

            "abstract": "Fine-grained image classification methods often suffer from the challenge that the subordinate categories within an entry-level category can only be distinguished by subtle differences. Crop disease classification is affected by various visual interferences, including uneven illumination, dew, and equipment jitter. It demands an effective algorithm to accurately discriminate one category from the others. Thus, the representational ability of algorithm needs to be strengthened to learn a robust domain-specific discrimination through an effective way. To address this challenge, a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) denoting the matrix-based convolutional neural network (M-bCNN) was proposed. Its hallmark is the convolutional kernel matrix, whose convolutional layers are arranged parallelly in the form of a matrix, and integrated with DropConnect, exponential linear unit, local response normalization, and so on to defeat over-fitting and vanishing gradient. With a tolerable addition of parameters, it can effectively increase the data streams, neurons, and link channels of the model compared with the commonly used plain networks. Therefore, it will create more non-linear mappings and will enhance the representational ability with a tolerable growth of parameters. The images of winter wheat leaf diseases were utilized as experimental samples for their strong similarities among sub-categories. A total of 16652 images containing eight categories were collected from Shandong Province, China, and were augmented into 83260 images. The M-bCNN delivered significant improvements and achieved an average validation accuracy of 96.5% and a testing accuracy of 90.1%; this outperformed AlexNet and VGG-16. The M-bCNN demonstrated accuracy gains with a convolutional kernel matrix in fine-grained image classification.",

Firstly, the method uses a two-dimensional filtering mask combined with a weighted multilevel median filter (2DFM-AMMF) for noise reduction, and uses a faster two-dimensional Otsu threshold segmentation algorithm (Faster 2D-Otsu) to reduce the interference of complex background with the detection of target blade in the image. Then the dynamic population firefly algorithm based on the chaos theory as well as the maximum and minimum distance algorithm is applied for optimization of the K-Means clustering algorithm (FCM-KM) to determine the optimal clustering class k value while addressing the tendency of the algorithm to fall into the local optimum problem. Combined with the R-CNN algorithm for the identification of rice diseases, FCM-KM analysis is conducted to determine the different sizes of the Faster R-CNN target frame. As revealed by the application results of 3010 images, the accuracy and time required for detection of rice blast, bacterial blight and blight were 96.71%/0.65s, 97.53%/0.82s and 98.26%/0.53s, respectively, indicating clearly that the method is more capable of detecting rice diseases and improving the identification accuracy of Faster R-CNN algorithm, while reducing the time required for identification.",

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.",

Based on these optimizations and EfficientNet backbones, we have developed a new family of object detectors, called EfficientDet, which consistently achieve much better efficiency than prior art across a wide spectrum of resource constraints. In particular, with single-model and single-scale, our EfficientDetD7 achieves state-of-the-art 52.2 AP on COCO test-dev with 52M parameters and 325B FLOPs, being 4x – 9x smaller and using 13x – 42x fewer FLOPs than previous detector.",

We first transformed the video into still frame, then sent the frame to the still-image detector for detection, and finally synthesized the frames into video. In the still-image detector, we used faster-RCNN as the framework. We used image-training models to detect relatively blurry videos. Additionally, a set of video-based evaluation metrics based on a machine learning classifier was proposed, which reflected the quality of video detection effectively in the experiments.

One of the most widely cultivated greenhouse crops is tomato, mainly because of its high nutritional value and its good taste. However, there are a number of anomalies for the tomato crop that pose a threat for its greenhouse cultivation. Detection of tomato anomalies in the complex natural environment is an important research direction in the field of plant science. Automated identification of tomato anomalies is still a challenging task because of its small size and complex background. To solve the problem of tomato anomaly detection in the complex natural environment, a novel YOLO-Dense was proposed based on a one-stage deep detection YOLO framework. By adding a dense connection module in the network architecture, the network inference speed of the proposed model can be effectively improved. By using the K-means algorithm to cluster the anchor box, nine different sizes of anchor boxes with potential objects to be identified were obtained. The multiscale training strategy was adopted to improve the recognition accuracy of objects at different scales. The experimental results show that the mAP and detection time of a single image of the YOLO-Dense network is 96.41% and 20.28 ms, respectively. Compared with SSD, Faster R-CNN, and the original YOLOv3 network, the YOLO-Dense model achieved the best performance in tomato anomaly detection under a complex natural environment.",

However, citrus detection is still a challenging task because of varying illumination, random occlusion and colour similarity between fruits and leaves in natural conditions. In this paper, a detection method called Lemon-YOLO (L-YOLO) is proposed to improve the accuracy and real-time performance of lemon detection in the natural environment. The SE_ResGNet34 network is designed to replace DarkNet53 network in YOLOv3 algorithm as a new backbone of feature extraction. It can enhance the propagation of features, and needs less parameter, which helps to achieve higher accuracy and speed. Moreover, the SE_ResNet module is added to the detection block, to improve the quality of representations produced from the network by strengthening the convolutional features of channels. The experimental results show that the proposed L-YOLO has an average accuracy(AP) of 96.28% and a detection speed of 106 frames per second (FPS) on the lemon test set, which is 5.68% and 28 FPS higher than the YOLOv3, respectively. The results indicate that the L-YOLO method has superior detection performance. It can recognize and locate lemons in the natural environment more efﬁciently, providing technical support for the machine’s picking lemon and other fruits.",

            "abstract": "In this article, two new models, namely granulated RCNN (G-RCNN) and multi-class deep SORT (MCD-SORT), for object detection and tracking, respectively from videos are developed. Object detection has two stages: object localization (region of interest RoI) and classification. G-RCNN is an improved version of the well-known Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN for extracting RoIs by incorporating the unique concept of granulation in a deep convolutional neural network. Granulation with spatio-temporal information enables more accurate extraction of RoIs (object regions) in unsupervised mode. Compared to Fast and Faster RCNNs, G-RCNN uses (i) granules (clusters) formed over the pooling feature map, instead of its all feature values, in defining RoIs, (ii) only the positive RoIs during training, instead of the whole RoI-map, (iii) videos directly as input, rather than static images, and (iv) only the objects in RoIs, instead of the entire feature map, for performing object classification. All these lead to the improvement in real-time detection speed and accuracy. MCD-SORT is an advanced form of the popular Deep SORT. In MCD-SORT, the searching for association of objects with trajectories is restricted only within the same categories. This increases the performance in multi-class tracking. These characteristic features have been demonstrated over 37 videos containing single-class, two-class, and multi-class objects. Superiority of the models over several state-of-the-art methodologies is also established extensively, both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

            "abstract": "Plant diseases can cause a considerable reduction in the quality and number of agricultural products. Guava, well known to be the tropics’ apple, is one significant fruit cultivated in tropical regions. It is attacked by 177 pathogens, including 167 fungal and others such as bacterial, algal, and nematodes. In addition, postharvest diseases may cause crucial production loss. Due to minor variations in various guava disease symptoms, an expert opinion is required for disease analysis. Improper diagnosis may cause economic losses to farmers’ improper use of pesticides. Automatic detection of diseases in plants once they emerge on the plants’ leaves and fruit is required to maintain high crop fields. In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven framework is presented to detect and classify the most common guava plant diseases. The proposed framework employs the Δ E color difference image segmentation to segregate the areas infected by the disease. Furthermore, color (RGB, HSV) histogram and textural (LBP) features are applied to extract rich, informative feature vectors. The combination of color and textural features are used to identify and attain similar outcomes compared to individual channels, while disease recognition is performed by employing advanced machine-learning classifiers (Fine KNN, Complex Tree, Boosted Tree, Bagged Tree, Cubic SVM). The proposed framework is evaluated on a high-resolution (18 MP) image dataset of guava leaves and fruit. The best recognition results were obtained by Bagged Tree classifier on a set of RGB, HSV, and LBP features (99% accuracy in recognizing four guava fruit diseases (Canker, Mummification, Dot, and Rust) against healthy fruit). The proposed framework may help the farmers to avoid possible production loss by taking early precautions.",

First, a new InvolutionBottleneck module was used to reduce the numbers of parameters and calculations, and to capture long-distance information in the space. Second, an SE module was added to improve the sensitivity of the model to channel features. Finally, the loss function ‘Generalized Intersection over Union’ was changed to ‘Efficient Intersection over Union’ to address the former’s degeneration into ‘Intersection over Union’. These proposed methods were used to improve the target recognition effect of the network model. In the experimental phase, to verify the effectiveness of the model, sample images were randomly selected from the constructed rubber tree disease database to form training and test sets. The test results showed that the mean average precision of the improved YOLOv5 network reached 70%, which is 5.4% higher than that of the original YOLOv5 network. The precision values of this model for powdery mildew and anthracnose detection were 86.5% and 86.8%, respectively. The overall detection performance of the improved YOLOv5 network was significantly better compared with those of the original YOLOv5 and the YOLOX_nano network models. The improved model accurately identified plant diseases under natural conditions, and it provides a technical reference for the prevention and control of plant diseases.",

            "abstract": "The prevention and management of crop diseases play an important role in agricultural production, but there are many types of crop diseases and complex causes, and their prevention and identification add difficulties to the process. The traditional methods of identifying diseases mostly rely on human visual and manual inspection, which requires a certain amount of expert knowledge and experience. There are shortcomings such as strong subjectivity and low accuracy. This paper takes the common diseases of kiwifruit as the research object. Based on deep learning and computer vision models, and given the influence of a complex background in actual scenes on the detection of diseases, as well as the shape and size characteristics of diseases, an innovative method of target detection and semantic segmentation was proposed to identify diseases accurately. The main contributions of this research are as follows: We produced the world’s first high-quality dataset on kiwifruit. We used the target detection algorithm YOLOX, we stripped the kiwi leaves from the natural background and removed the influencing factors existing in the complex background. Based on the mainstream semantic segmentation networks UNet and DeepLabv3+, the experimental results showed that the ResNet101 network achieved the most effective results in the identification of kiwi diseases, with an accuracy rate of 96.6%. We used the training method of learning rate decay to further improve the training effect without increasing the training cost. After experimental verification, our two-stage disease detection algorithm had the advantages of high accuracy, strong robustness, and wide detection range, which provided a more efficient solution for solving the problem of precise monitoring of crop growth environment parameters.",

            "abstract": "The effectiveness of Object Detection, one of the central problems in computer vision tasks, highly depends on the definition of the loss function — a measure of how accurately your ML model can predict the expected outcome. Conventional object detection loss functions depend on aggregation of metrics of bounding box regression such as the distance, overlap area and aspect ratio of the predicted and ground truth boxes (i.e. GIoU, CIoU, ICIoU etc). However, none of the methods proposed and used to date considers the direction of the mismatch between the desired ground box and the predicted, “experimental” box. This shortage results in slower and less effective convergence as the predicted box can “wander around” during the training process and eventually end up producing a worse model. In this paper a new loss function SIoU was suggested, where penalty metrics were redefined considering the angle of the vector between the desired regression. Applied to conventional Neural Networks and datasets it is shown that SIoU improves both the speed of training and the accuracy of the inference. The effectiveness of the proposed loss function was revealed in a number of simulations and tests. In particular, the application of SIoU to the COCO-train/COCO-val results in improvements of +2.4% (mAP@0.5:0.95) and +3.6%(mAP@0.5) over other Loss Functions.",

Because of the fore mentioned factor, plant diseases are more prevalent in agricultural fields and are easier to identify. Vigilance for the detection of plant diseases has risen due to current agricultural monitoring in numerous and diverse locations. This study presents an image-based method for the Detection of Black gram Crop Disease (DBCD). The Black gram plant is often referred to as “urad” in India and is officially recognized as “Vigna mungo”. This work considers four diseases anthracnose, leaf crinkle, powdery mildew, and yellow mosaic diseases, which have a considerable negative influence on the production of black gram. The black gram crop diseases were classified in this study using the BPLD dataset. For a comparati ve classification analysis, three machine learning algorithms and two deep learning techniques were considered. This classification study for the diagnosis of Black gram crop disease makes use of the artificial neural network and convolutional neural network of deep learning, as well as the decision tree, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor algorithms of machine learning. Here, the accuracy, precision and recall are measured in order to compare various classification models. As per the analysis, CNN outperforms in every aspect when compared to other classifications with 89% accuracy.",

Diseases affect the growth and produce of the crops and often difficult to control. To ensure good quality and high production, it is necessary to have accurate disease diagnosis and control actions to prevent them in time. Grape which is widely grown crop in India and it may be affected by different types of diseases on leaf, stem and fruit. Leaf diseases which are the early symptoms caused due to fungi, bacteria and virus. So, there is a need to have an automatic system that can be used to detect the type of diseases and to take appropriate actions. We have proposed an automatic system for detecting the diseases in the grape vines using image processing and machine learning technique. The system segments the leaf (Region of Interest) from the background image using grab cut segmentation method. From the segmented leaf part the diseased region is fruther segmented based on two different methods such as global thresholding and using semi-supervised technique. The features are extracted from the segmented diseased part and it has been classified as healthy, rot, esca, and leaf blight using different machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), adaboost and Random Forest tree. Using SVM we have obtained a better testing accuracy of 93%.",

Among the agricultural products, tomato is one of the most used crops. Thus, preventing significant loss in quantity and yield of tomato is majorly dependent on recognition and classification of diseases a tomato plant might possess. Latest and fostering technologies like Image processing is used to rectify such issues using different types of techniques and algorithms. Initially, the leaves of a tomato plant get affected, when plant develops a particular type of disease. In this project, four consecutive stages are used to discover the type of disease. The four stages include pre-processing, leaf segmentation, feature extraction and classification. To remove the noise we are doing the pre-processing and to part the affected or damages area of the leaf, image segmentation is used. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which is a guided, supervised and advance machine learning algorithm, is implemented to find solutions for both the problems related to classification and regression. During the terminal stage, user is recommended with the treatment. Mostly live plants are adversely affected by the diseases. This paper imparts representation of leaf disease detection employing image processing that can identify drawbacks in tomato plant from images, based on color, bound and texture to give the brisk and reliable results to the farmer.",

We propose three vegetable and fruit leaf pest detection methods, namely, squeeze-and excitation SSD (Se_SSD), DB_SSD, and DBA_SSD. Se_SSD fuses SSD feature extraction network and attention mechanism channel, DB_SSD improves VGG feature extraction network, and DBA_SSD fuses the improved VGG network and channel attention mechanism. To reduce the training time and accelerate the training process, the convolutional layers trained in the Image Net image dataset by the VGG model are migrated to this model, whereas the collected vegetable and fruit disease image dataset is randomly divided into training set, validation set, and test set in the ratio of 8:1:1. In addition, data enhancement methods, such as histogram equalization and horizontal flip were used to expand the image data. The performance of the three improved algorithms is compared and analyzed in the same environment and with the classical target detection algorithms YOLOv4, YOLOv3, Faster RCNN, and YOLOv4 tiny. Experiments show that DBA_SSD outperforms the two other improved algorithms, and its performance in comparative analysis is superior to other target detection algorithms.",

In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.",

Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. is based on an inverted residual structure where the shortcut connections are between the thin bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on ImageNet [1] classification, COCO object detection [2], VOC image segmentation [3]. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as actual latency, and the number of parameters.",

MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.",

            "abstract": "Crop leaf purpling is a common phenotypic change when plants are subject to some biotic and abiotic stresses during their growth. The extraction of purple leaves can monitor crop stresses as an apparent trait and meanwhile contributes to crop phenotype analysis, monitoring, and yield estimation. Due to the complexity of the field environment as well as differences in size, shape, texture, and color gradation among the leaves, purple leaf segmentation is difficult. In this study, we used a U-Net model for segmenting purple rapeseed leaves during the seedling stage based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB imagery at the pixel level. With the limited spatial resolution of rapeseed images acquired by UAV and small object size, the input patch size was carefully selected. Experiments showed that the U-Net model with the patch size of 256 × 256 pixels obtained better and more stable results with a F-measure of 90.29% and an Intersection of Union (IoU) of 82.41%. To further explore the influence of image spatial resolution, we evaluated the performance of the U-Net model with different image resolutions and patch sizes. The U-Net model performed better compared with four other commonly used image segmentation approaches comprising support vector machine, random forest, HSeg, and SegNet. Moreover, regression analysis was performed between the purple rapeseed leaf ratios and the measured N content. The negative exponential model had a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.858, thereby explaining much of the rapeseed leaf purpling in this study. This purple leaf phenotype could be an auxiliary means for monitoring crop growth status so that crops could be managed in a timely and effective manner when nitrogen stress occurs. Results demonstrate that the U-Net model is a robust method for purple rapeseed leaf segmentation and that the accurate segmentation of purple leaves provides a new method for crop nitrogen stress monitoring.",

In order to improve the detection accuracy and efficiency, an early diagnosis method for ATLDs based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed. We first collect the images of apple tree leaves with and without diseases from both laboratories and cultivation fields, and establish dataset containing five common ATLDs and healthy leaves. The DCNN model proposed in this paper for ATLDs recognition combines DenseNet and Xception, using global average pooling instead of fully connected layers. We extract features by the proposed convolutional neural network then use a support vector machine to classify the apple leaf diseases. Including the proposed DCNN, several DCNNs are trained for ATLDs recognition. The proposed network achieves an overall accuracy of 98.82% in identifying the ATLDs, which is higher than Inception-v3, MobileNet, VGG-16, DenseNet-201, Xception, VGG-INCEP. Moreover, the proposed model has the fastest convergence rate, and a relatively small number of parameters and high robustness compared with the mentioned models. This research indicates that the proposed deep learning model provides a better solution for ATLDs control. It could be also integrated into smart apple cultivation systems.",

However, rice plants cannot be separated from pests and diseases, especially diseases in rice plants. Rice plant diseases can affect the amount of rice production. From these problems, we need a method that can detect rice plant diseases. In this study, we propose a hybrid model that combines Neural Network and Evolutionary Algorithm models and feature extraction of Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to detect rice plant diseases. In this study, the evolutionary algorithm uses Genetic Algorithm (GA). The proposed method can determine the value of Neural Network parameters including epoch, learning rate, and momentum which can provide the best accuracy value. The image dataset of rice plant disease is used in this study. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed method produces an accuracy of 97.5%. From the results of research on rice plant diseases, this study produces the best accuracy compared to previous studies.",

Relationship of weather parameter were explored with peaks of brown plant hopper (BPH) outbreak data, which was available of Ludhiana (Punjab) during 2007- 2011 on government of India official agriculture data website. The purpose of this research is to highlight the importance of the planning strategies for agriculture with abrupt change in weather conditions.

        "abstract": ": There have been several initiatives taken to guarantee higher yields and higher-quality crops as the agriculture sector grows. The agriculture industry is severely impacted by plant and agricultural illnesses and deficits. Several techniques and technologies have been developed to aid in the diagnosis, management, and eventual eradication of plant diseases. The efficient and accurate identification of plant diseases could be aided by the development of a quick and accurate model. The use of deep convolutional neural networks for image categorization has greatly improved accuracy. In this paper, we present a framework for automating disease detection by the use of a tailored DL architecture. Both the Plant Village dataset and the real-time field dataset are utilized in the testing process. Our model’s results are compared to those of other spatial exploitation models. The results show that the proposed method is superior to the standard deep-learning classifier. This proves the network’s potential for usage in real-time applications by extracting high-level features that boost the efficiency and accuracy while reducing the risk introduced by a manual procedure. In order to enable a prompt reaction, and perhaps a targeted pesticide application, the suggested method has the ability to provide the early diagnoses of plant vital health.",

However, there is a lack of imaging systems targeted specifically at plant science duties, resulting in low precision for canopy-scale measurements. This study trials a prototype multispectral system designed specifically for plant studies and looks at its use as an early detection system for visually asymptomatic disease phases, in this case Pyrenopeziza brassicae in Brassica napus. The analysis takes advantage of machine learning in the form of feature selection and novelty detection to facilitate the classification. An initial study into recording the morphology of the samples is also included to allow for further improvement to the system performance. The proposed method was able to detect light leaf spot infection with 92% accuracy when imaging entire oilseed rape plants from above, 12 days after inoculation and 13 days before the appearance of visible symptoms. False colour mapping of spectral vegetation indices was used to quantify disease severity and its distribution within the plant canopy. In addition, the structure of the plant was recorded using photometric stereo, with the output influencing regions used for diagnosis. The shape of the plants was also recorded using photometric stereo, which allowed for reconstruction of the leaf angle and surface texture, although further work is needed to improve the fidelity due to uneven lighting distributions, to allow for reflectance compensation. The ability of active multispectral imaging has been demonstrated along with the improvement in time taken to detect light leaf spot at a high accuracy. The importance of capturing structural information is outlined, with its effect on reflectance and thus classification illustrated. The system could be used in plant breeding to enhance the selection of resistant cultivars, with its early and quantitative capability.",

        "abstract": "Advances in deep learning have significantly impacted various sectors, including agriculture, by improving efficiency and sustainability. Computer vision-based plant disease detection that utilizes deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) has replaced manual methods that require specialized skills. Vision Transformers (ViTs) with self-attention mechanisms excel at recognizing complex patterns in images of diseased plants, enabling early detection and more effective management. This study conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the use of feature fusion-based transformer algorithms in plant disease detection and to identify current research trends, challenges, and future opportunities. The results show that ViTs can improve accuracy and efficiency in plant disease diagnosis, particularly under diverse environmental conditions. However, the adoption of this technology faces obstacles such as the need for large annotated datasets, significant computational costs, and variability in field conditions that can affect model performance. This research highlights the need for further innovation to address these challenges and expand the accessibility and reliability of deep learning-based plant disease detection for the global agricultural sector.",

            "abstract": "The complex backgrounds of crop disease images and the small contrast between the disease area and the background can easily cause confusion, which seriously affects the robustness and accuracy of apple disease- identification models. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a Vision Transformer-based lightweight apple leaf disease- identification model, ConvViT, to extract effective features of crop disease spots to identify crop diseases. Our ConvViT includes convolutional structures and Transformer structures; the convolutional structure is used to extract the global features of the image, and the Transformer structure is used to obtain the local features of the disease region to help the CNN see better. The patch embedding method is improved to retain more edge information of the image and promote the information exchange between patches in the Transformer. The parameters and FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) of the model are significantly reduced by using depthwise separable convolution and linear-complexity multi-head attention operations. Experimental results on a complex background of a self-built apple leaf disease dataset show that ConvViT achieves comparable identification results (96.85%) with the current performance of the state-of-the-art Swin-Tiny. The parameters and FLOPs are only 32.7% and 21.7% of Swin-Tiny, and significantly ahead of MobilenetV3, Efficientnet-b0, and other models, which indicates that the proposed model is indeed an effective disease-identification model with practical application value.",

Image processing techniques based on artificial neural networks are used for the non-destructive detection of leaf diseases on the plant. Since leaf diseases have a complex structure, it is necessary to increase the accuracy and generalizability of the developed machine learning models. In this study, an artificial neural network model for bean leaf disease detection was developed by fusing descriptive vectors obtained from bean leaves with HOG (Histogram Oriented Gradient) feature extraction and transfer learning feature extraction methods. The model using feature fusion has higher accuracy than only HOG feature extraction and only transfer learning feature extraction models. Also, the feature fusion model converged to the solution faster. Feature fusion model had 98.33, 98.40 and 99.24% accuracy in training, validation, and test datasets, respectively. The study shows that the proposed method can effectively capture interclass distinguishing features faster and more accurately.\n",

            "abstract": "Coffee leaf diseases can significantly impact the productivity and quality of the crops. Accurate and timely identification of these diseases is crucial for effective management and control. This paper proposes a hybrid feature fusion approach for identifying coffee leaf disease, including early and late feature fusion. First, we propose several hybrid models to extract the information feature in the input images by combining MobileNetV3, Swin Transformer, and variational autoencoder (VAE). MobileNetV3, acting on the inductive bias of locality, can extract image features that are closer to one another (local features), while the Swin Transformer is able to extract feature interactions that are further apart (high-level features). These differently extracted features contain complementary information that enriches a unified feature map. Second, the extracted images from models are fused in the early fusion network. The early-fusion learner network is deployed to learn the rich information from the extracted feature. The late fusion network is implemented to comprehensively learn the fused feature before a classification network classifies coffee leaf diseases. The proposed hybrid feature fusion approach is evaluated on a challenging, real world Robusta Coffee Leaf (RoCoLe) dataset with various diseases, including red spider mite and leaf rust disease. The results show that our approach, the hybrid feature fusion of MobileNetV3 and Swin Transformer, outperforms the individual models with an accuracy of 84.29%. In conclusion, the hybrid feature fusion approach combining MobileNetV3 and Swin Transformer models is a promising approach for coffee leaf disease identification, providing accurate and timely diagnosis for effective management and control of the diseases in real-world conditions.",

            "abstract": "Since rain streaks exhibit diverse geometric appearances and irregular overlapped phenomena, these complex characteristics challenge the design of an effective single image deraining model. To this end, rich local-global information representations are increasingly indispensable for better satisfying rain removal. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Hybrid CNN-Transformer Feature Fusion Network (dubbed as HCT-FFN) in a stage-by-stage progressive manner, which can harmonize these two architectures to help image restoration by leveraging their individual learning strengths. Specifically, we stack a sequence of the degradation-aware mixture of experts (DaMoE) modules in the CNN-based stage, where appropriate local experts adaptively enable the model to emphasize spatially-varying rain distribution features. As for the Transformer-based stage, a background-aware vision Transformer (BaViT) module is employed to complement spatially-long feature dependencies of images, so as to achieve global texture recovery while preserving the required structure. Considering the indeterminate knowledge discrepancy among CNN features and Transformer features, we introduce an interactive fusion branch at adjacent stages to further facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality deraining results. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness and extensibility of our developed HCT-FFN. The source code is available at https://github.com/cschenxiang/HCT-FFN.",

The existing crop disease recognition models are mainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). Although traditional CNN models have excellent performance in modeling local relationships, it is difficult to extract global features. This study combines the advantages of CNN in extracting local disease information and vision transformer in obtaining global receptive fields to design a hybrid model called MSCVT. The model incorporates the multiscale self-attention module, which combines multiscale convolution and self-attention mechanisms and enables the fusion of local and global features at both the shallow and deep levels of the model. In addition, the model uses the inverted residual block to replace normal convolution to maintain a low number of parameters. To verify the validity and adaptability of MSCVT in the crop disease dataset, experiments were conducted in the PlantVillage dataset and the Apple Leaf Pathology dataset, and obtained results with recognition accuracies of 99.86% and 97.50%, respectively. In comparison with other CNN models, the proposed model achieved advanced performance in both cases. The experimental results show that MSCVT can obtain high recognition accuracy in crop disease recognition and shows excellent adaptability in multidisease recognition and small-scale disease recognition.",

            "abstract": "The use of neural networks for plant disease identification is a hot topic of current research. However, unlike the classification of ordinary objects, the features of plant diseases frequently vary, resulting in substantial intra-class variation; in addition, the complex environmental noise makes it more challenging for the model to categorize the diseases. In this paper, an attention and multidimensional feature fusion neural network (AMDFNet) is proposed for Camellia oleifera disease classification network based on multidimensional feature fusion and attentional mechanism, which improves the classification ability of the model by fusing features to each layer of the Inception structure and enhancing the fused features with attentional enhancement. The model was compared with the classical convolutional neural networks GoogLeNet, Inception V3, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 and the latest disease image classification network DICNN in a self-built camellia disease dataset. The experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the new model reaches 86.78% under the same experimental conditions, which is 2.3% higher than that of GoogLeNet with a simple Inception structure, and the number of parameters is reduced to one-fourth compared to large models such as ResNet50. The method proposed in this paper can be run on mobile with higher identification accuracy and a smaller model parameter number.",

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has been utilized for classifying cocoa diseases, focusing on combating the significant agricultural and economic impacts of black pod rot and pod borer. Utilizing a dataset of 4390 images, five CNN architectures—Custom CNN, VGG-16, EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and LeNet-5—were assessed for their ability to accurately identify disease presence. The Custom CNN model was found to be the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 91.79%, precision of 91.79%, recall of 91.79%, F1 score of 82.08%, sensitivity of 96.69%, and specificity of 98.40%, indicating its strong capability in correctly classifying both healthy and diseased plants. The work methodically approached data preprocessing, model parameter tuning, and a structured machine learning evaluation process. While EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50 also displayed commendable performances, VGG-16 and LeNet-5 lagged, suggesting the need for further model refinement. This work underscores the importance of the F1 score in evaluating model performance, especially given the class imbalance within the dataset. The findings suggest future exploration into other pre-trained models and data augmentation strategies to further enhance classification accuracy. The goal of this work is the implementation of a realtime system to minimize cocoa production losses due to disease.",

These diseases and pests often present different scales and morphologies, and some pest and disease target sizes can be tiny and difficult to detect. To solve these problems, we propose TeaViTNet, a multi-scale attention-based tea pest and disease detection model that combines CNNs and Transformers. First, MobileViT is used as the feature extraction backbone network. MobileViT captures and analyzes the tiny pest and disease features in the image via a self-attention mechanism and global feature extraction. Second, the EMA-PANet network is introduced to optimize the model’s learning and attention to the Apolygus lucorum and leaf blight regions via an efficient multi-scale attention module with cross-space learning, which improves the model’s ability to understand multi-scale information. In addition, RFBNet is embedded in the module to further expand the perceptual range and effectively capture the information of tiny features in tea leaf images. Finally, the ODCSPLayer convolutional block is introduced, aiming to focus on acquiring richer gradient flow information. The experimental results show that the TeaViTNet model proposed in this paper has an average accuracy of 89.1%, which is a significant improvement over the baseline network MobileViT and is capable of accurately detecting Apolygus lucorum and leaf blight of different scales and complexities.",

We can efficiently accomplish this goal with the aid of Deep learning, an application of AI. In this study, the dataset contains 2310 images for the analysis and disease detection. For the diagnosis purpose, the ResNet 152V2, YOLO V3, and YOLO V5 were implemented on dataset. The whole image samples are further categorized into 3 major categories sets such as test, train, and validation. The images were preprocessed in the context of their identical size [224,224] for better feature selection process. After implementing the ResNet 152V2, YOLO V3, and YOLO V5 models, it can be seen that ResNet152V2 produces 26.13% Train-loss, 3S.22% Vald-loss, 93.54%, and S9.62% train-Acc and Vald-Acc respectively. Through YOLOV3, 21.20%, 96.41% was Train-loss and Vald-loss and 4S.S6%, 93.40% training and Vald-Acc was achieved.

            "abstract": "The identification of grape leaf diseases based on deep learning is critical to controlling the spread of diseases and ensuring the healthy development of the grape industry. Focusing on the lack of training images of grape leaf diseases, this paper proposes a novel model named Leaf GAN, which is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), to generate images of four different grape leaf diseases for training identification models. A generator model with degressive channels is first designed to generate grape leaf disease images; then, the dense connectivity strategy and instance normalization are fused into an efficient discriminator to identify real and fake disease images by utilizing their excellent feature extraction capability on grape leaf lesions. Finally, the deep regret gradient penalty method is applied to stabilize the training process of the model. Using a total of 4,062 grape leaf disease images, the Leaf GAN model ultimately generates 8,124 grape leaf disease images. The generated grape leaf disease images based on Leaf GAN model can obtain better performance than DCGAN and WGAN in terms of the Fréchet inception distance. The experimental results show that the proposed Leaf GAN model generates sufficient grape leaf disease images with prominent lesions, providing a feasible solution for the data augmentation of grape leaf disease images. For the eight prevailing classification models with the expanded dataset, the identification performance based on CNNs indicated higher accuracies, whereby all the accuracies were better than those of the initial dataset with other data augmentation methods. Among them, Xception achieves a recognition accuracy of 98.70% on the testing set. The results demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation method represents a new approach to overcoming the overfitting problem in disease identification and can effectively improve the identification accuracy.",

The great majority of automated systems developed thus far are based on digital pictures, allowing for the rapid deployment of algorithms. The difficulty of autonomous illness identification in plants has been solved using traditional machine learning approaches such as (SVM) support vector machines, Multilayer Perception Neural Networks, and Decision Trees. The focus of this article was on leaf plant disease. A new plant leaf disease detection technique has been developed that is based on a transfer learning methodology such as deep learning, where CNN is employed as a feature extractor and SVM is used for classification. A benchmark dataset called PlantVillage was used to assess the evaluation of the proposed model. The suggested model was examined and compared to current methodologies, and it outperformed previous work, achieving an 88.77 percent training accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Precision agriculture, which is an emerging approach carried out to achieve improved crop productivity and sustainability by harnessing the use of integrated advanced technologies, has been an emerging approach. Among these, machine learning (ML) has been shown to have significant promise in the use case of plant disease diagnosis and transformation in order for it to become an accurate, timely, scalable solution. While ML has been applied to the precise diagnosis of plant diseases in this research, it was found to have a great potential to improve agricultural outcomes. Nowadays ML algorithms—both supervised and unsupervised—weeks used for analyzing series of datasets appropriated with plant health images, environmental condition data, and historical disease records. The efforts on the task of disease symptom identification have demonstrated high success with techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and forms of ensembles. Furthermore, CNNs excel in dealing with high resolution images and detecting disease indicators that may not be visible through conventional means.In addition, ML is also integrated with remote sensing, and mobile platforms. Real time real data on crop conditions and stress factors is of great help to early detection of diseases through remote sensing. Mobile applications with ML algorithms also enable on the spot plant disease diagnosis from the smartphone camera, enabling site rather than later intervention. Current ML techniques in plant disease diagnosis and their impact on disease management and crop health are studied and a case study is made. The results highlight the benefits of ML application, such as improved accuracy of diagnostic, decreased reliance on manual inspections and increase in scalability, which will contribute to agricultural sustainable.",

In today’s digitalized world, these techniques have been combined with IoT technology and machine learning algorithms, which have given rise to smart agriculture systems. However, farmers who live in developing countries hesitate to use such systems because of their hardware and maintenance costs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a low-cost farmland digital twin framework called AgriLoRa for smart agriculture. AgriLoRa consists of a wireless sensor network established in the farmland and cloud servers that run computer vision algorithms to detect plant diseases, weed clusters and plant nutrient deﬁciencies. In order to assess the feasibility of accurate plant disease detection, we have performed initial experiments with agricultural vision datasets using two different algorithms, the MobileNet and UNet models, and achieved successful results. AgriLoRa is promising to achieve a low-cost, high-precision smart agriculture solution to address the growing high-yield production needs of farmers worldwide.",

Smart farming, also known as precision agriculture, has emerged as an advanced approach to tackle modern challenges in crop production. At the heart of this cutting-edge technology is machine learning, serving as the driving force behind its implementation. Though, there are many algorithms are available in crop prediction process, the problem of predicting vague information is still a challenging issue. Unfortunately, existing algorithms mostly avoids the complicated instances in crop recommendation dataset by not handling them effectively, due to imbalance class distribution. Hence in this research work to conduct an intelligent farming, two different uncertain theories are adopted to handle the issue of vagueness in appropriate recommendation of crop by considering soil fertility and climatic condition. The proposed is developed based on uncertainty expert system with both neutrosophicalparaconsistent inference model. The neutrosophic inference model is integrated with the paraconsistent logic to overcome the problem of uncertainty in prediction of appropriate crop by representing the factors in terms of certainty degree and contradiction degree. The rule generated by paraconsistent model is validated to improve the accuracy of crop prediction by fusing the knowledge of butterfly optimization algorithm. The nectar searching behavior of the butterflies are used for searching potential rules as a validation process. With the pruned rules generated by uncertainty expert model, the suitable crop is predicted more accurately compared to the other existing prediction models.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and earlier detection of plant leaf diseases is important for precision agriculture, and also to avoid financial loss and improve crop productivity. Many of the plant leaf diseases exhibit visible symptoms, it is hard to manually identify the plant leaf diseases. Therefore, image processing based computer aided tools is essential for prompt and accurate plant disease detection. This study presents an optimal segmentation with Alexnet based feature extraction for plant leaf disease diagnosis (OSAFEM-PLDD) technique. The proposed OSAFEM-PLDD technique intends to determine and classify various kinds of plant diseases using leaf images. The OSAFEM-PLDD technique involves fuzzy filtering (FF) based pre-processing to remove the noise and improve the image quality. In addition, chicken swarm optimization (CSO) with Kapur's thresholding based segmentation approach was employed for the detection of affected leaf regions. Moreover, AlexNet method was utilized for deriving a helpful group of feature vectors and finally, functional link neural network (FLNN) based classification model is used to perform effective plant disease diagnosis. To showcase the enhanced performance of the OSAFEM-PLDD technique, a wide range of simulations are carried out on benchmark plant leaf disease datasets and the experimental outcomes highlighted the enhanced performance of the OSAFEM-PLDD technique over the recent methods.",

The proposed filter consists of a fuzzy number construction process, a fuzz filtering process, a genetic learning process, and an image knowledge base. First, the fuzzy number construction process receives sample images or the noise-free image and then constructs an image knowledge base for the fuzzy filtering process. Second, the fuzzy filtering process contains a parallel fuzzy inference mechanism, a fuzzy mean process, and a fuzzy decision process to perform the task of noise removal. Finally, based on the genetic algorithm, the genetic learning process adjusts the parameters of the image knowledge base. By the experimental results, GFIF achieves a better performance than the state-of-the-art filters based on the criteria of Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR), Mean-Square-Error (MSE), and Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE). On the subjective evaluation of those filtered images, GFIF also results in a higher quality of global restoration.",

Many Machine Learning (ML) models have been employed for the detection and classification of plant diseases but, after the advancements in a subset of ML, that is, Deep Learning (DL), this area of research appears to have great potential in terms of increased accuracy. Many developed/modified DL architectures are implemented along with several visualization techniques to detect and classify the symptoms of plant diseases. Moreover, several performance metrics are used for the evaluation of these architectures/techniques. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of DL models used to visualize various plant diseases. In addition, some research gaps are identified from which to obtain greater transparency for detecting diseases in plants, even before their symptoms appear clearly.",

Against this background, we present PlantDoc: a dataset for visual plant disease detection. Our dataset contains 2,598 data points in total across 13 plant species and up to 17 classes of diseases, involving approximately 300 human hours of effort in annotating internet scraped images. To show the efficacy of our dataset, we learn 3 models for the task of plant disease classification. Our results show that modelling using our dataset can increase the classification accuracy by up to 31%. We believe that our dataset can help reduce the entry barrier of computer vision techniques in plant disease detection.",

Over the day, it became a high-level degree of complexity due to the huge volume of cultivated plants. Now a day, the diseases are very different due to diverted manure procedures, and its diagnosis will be very tough even experienced farmers and agronomists too. Even though, after diagnosis, there is a lack of perfect remedy or mistaken treatment for that. The plants are affecting by many vascular fungal diseases which are widespread in many crops. Fusarium wilt (FW) is one of the fungal diseases in many plants. Mostly the tomato, sweet potatoes, tobacco, legumes, cucurbits plants are affected by this Fusarium oxysporum (FO) disease often due to its soil. The main goal of this research article is used to determine FO disease in the tomato plant leaves. Besides, the proposed algorithm constructs model with two times classifying and identifying the disease for better accuracy. The open database consists of 87k images with 60% affected leaves images, 40% healthy plant leaves too. Our proposed hybrid algorithm is found the disease with 96% accuracy with the huge amount of dataset.",

            "abstract": "Plants are a major source of food for the world population. Plant diseases contribute to production loss, which can be tackled with continuous monitoring. Manual plant disease monitoring is both laborious and error-prone. Early detection of plant diseases using computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) can help to reduce the adverse effects of diseases and also overcome the shortcomings of continuous human monitoring. In this work, we propose the use of a deep learning architecture based on a recent convolutional neural network called EfficientNet on 18,161 plain and segmented tomato leaf images to classify tomato diseases. The performance of two segmentation models i.e., U-net and Modified U-net, for the segmentation of leaves is reported. The comparative performance of the models for binary classification (healthy and unhealthy leaves), six-class classification (healthy and various groups of diseased leaves), and ten-class classification (healthy and various types of unhealthy leaves) are also reported. The modified U-net segmentation model showed accuracy, IoU, and Dice score of 98.66%, 98.5%, and 98.73%, respectively, for the segmentation of leaf images. EfficientNet-B7 showed superior performance for the binary classification and six-class classification using segmented images with an accuracy of 99.95% and 99.12%, respectively. Finally, EfficientNet-B4 achieved an accuracy of 99.89% for ten-class classification using segmented images. It can be concluded that all the architectures performed better in classifying the diseases when trained with deeper networks on segmented images. The performance of each of the experimental studies reported in this work outperforms the existing literature.",

In past years, many technological advancements have been introduced to enhance harvest quality and quantity by controlling and preventing weeds, pests, and diseases. Several studies have focused on identifying diseases in plants, as it helps to make decisions on spraying fungicides and fertilizers. State-of-the-art systems typically combine image processing and deep learning methods to identify conditions with visible symptoms. However, they use already available data sets or images taken in controlled environments. This study was conducted on two data sets of ten plants collected in a natural environment. The first dataset contained RGB Visible images, while the second contained Near-Infrared (NIR) images of healthy and diseased leaves. The visible image dataset showed higher training and validation accuracies than the NIR image dataset with ResNet, Inception, VGG and MobileNet architectures. For the visible image and NIR dataset, ResNet-50V2 outperformed other models with validation accuracies of 98.35% and 94.01%, respectively.",

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.",

We then look at the differing patterns of agricultural inputs across countries and the divergent productivity paths taken by their agricultural sectors. Next we examine productivity more closely and the evidence that the global rate of agricultural productivity growth is declining?with potentially serious prospects for the price and availability of food for the poorest people in the world. Finally we consider patterns of agricultural research and development efforts.",

Hyperspectral remote sensing can potentially detect and quantify viral diseases in a nondestructive manner. This study utilized hyperspectral imagery at the plant level to identify and classify grapevines inoculated with the newly discovered DNA virus grapevine vein-clearing virus (GVCV) at the early asymptomatic stages. An experiment was set up at a test site at South Farm Research Center, Columbia, MO, USA (38.92 N, −92.28 W), with two grapevine groups, namely healthy and GVCV-infected, while other conditions were controlled. Images of each vine were captured by a SPECIM IQ 400–1000 nm hyperspectral sensor (Oulu, Finland). Hyperspectral images were calibrated and preprocessed to retain only grapevine pixels. A statistical approach was employed to discriminate two reflectance spectra patterns between healthy and GVCV vines. Disease-centric vegetation indices (VIs) were established and explored in terms of their importance to the classification power. Pixel-wise (spectral features) classification was performed in parallel with image-wise (joint spatial–spectral features) classification within a framework involving deep learning architectures and traditional machine learning. The results showed that: (1) the discriminative wavelength regions included the 900–940 nm range in the near-infrared (NIR) region in vines 30 days after sowing (DAS) and the entire visual (VIS) region of 400–700 nm in vines 90 DAS; (2) the normalized pheophytization index (NPQI), fluorescence ratio index 1 (FRI1), plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), anthocyanin index (AntGitelson), and water stress and canopy temperature (WSCT) measures were the most discriminative indices; (3) the support vector machine (SVM) was effective in VI-wise classification with smaller feature spaces, while the RF classifier performed better in pixel-wise and image-wise classification with larger feature spaces; and (4) the automated 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) feature extractor provided promising results over the 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) in learning features from hyperspectral data cubes with a limited number of samples.",

            "abstract": "Plant disease, especially crop plants, is a major threat to global food security since many diseases directly affect the quality of the fruits, grains, and so on, leading to a decrease in agricultural productivity. Farmers have to observe and determine whether a leaf was infected by naked eyes. This process is unreliable, inconsistent, and error prone. Several works on deep learning techniques for detecting leaf diseases had been proposed. Most of them built their models based on limited resolution images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this research, we aim at detecting early disease on plant leaves with small disease blobs, which can only be detected with higher resolution images, by an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. After a pre-processing step using a contrast enhancement method, all the infested blobs are segmented for the whole dataset. A list of several measurement-based features that represents the blobs are chosen and then selected based on their influences on the model’s performance using a wrapper-based feature selection algorithm, which is built based on a hybrid metaheuristic. The chosen features are used as inputs for an ANN. We compare the results obtained using our methods with another approach using popular CNN models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet-50) enhanced with transfer learning. The ANN’s results are better than those of CNNs using a simpler network structure (89.41% vs 78.64%, 79.92%, and 84.88%, respectively). This shows that our approach can be implemented on low-end devices such as smartphones, which will be of great assistance to farmers on the field.",

        "abstract": ": Plant diseases are a critical threat to global food security and agricultural sustainability because of the crop losses they cause. 195 million tons of crops are lost to fungal diseases each year and alone in India, more than 5 million metric tonnes go waste annually from it[1]. Also, from FAO “Globally up to 16% of harvests worth about US$220 billion are lost due to plant pests every year” [2] The urgency of the situation is clear, as wrapped up in these figures are reasons why long-term growth requires early bite detection services to prevent plant disease. In this paper, deep learning algorithms were used to detect diseases in plants by taking image of the leaves as input. Our research is limited to the detection of these 6 plant diseases, Aphid infestation, Bacterial leaf spot disease Black apple scab Early blight Septoria leaf spot on tomato Grape powdery mildew. In order to do this, we construct and train a machine learning model using two different raw image datasets. These were meticulously curated and enriched datasets, geared towards improving the model's generalisability across extensive variety of conditions. Our approach not only facilitates the early detection of these diseases but also demonstrates the potential for scalable, real-time applications in agricultural settings. The results highlight the effectiveness of deep learning in identifying and classifying plant diseases, offering a promising solution for reducing crop losses and improving agricultural productivity.",

Excessive use of pesticide for plant diseases treatment increases the cost and environmental pollution so their use must be minimized. This can be achieved by targeting the diseases places, with the appropriate quantity and concentration of pesticide by estimating disease severity using image processing technique. Simple threshold and Triangle thresholding methods are used to segment the leaf area and lesion region area respectively. Finally diseases are catcogrise by calculating the quotient of lesion area and leaf area. The accuracy of the experiment is found to be 98.60 %. Research indicates that this method to calculate leaf disease severity is fast and accurate. Sugarcane being a long duration crop of 10 to 18 months, attacked by a number of diseases. Fungi- caused diseases in sugarcane are the most predominant diseases which appear as spots on the leaves. These spots prevent the vital process of photosynthesis to take place, hence to a large extent affects the growth and consequently the yield. In case of severe infection, the leaf becomes totally covered with spots. The various types of diseases on sugarcane determine the quality, quantity, and stability of yield. The diseases in sugarcane not only reduce the yield but also deteriorate of the variety and its withdrawal from cultivation.Excessive uses of pesticide for plant diseases treatment increases the danger of toxic residue level on agricultural products and has been identified as a major contributor to ground water contamination also pesticides are among the highest components in the production cost their use must be minimized. This can be achieved by estimating severity of disease and target the diseases places, with the appropriate quantity and concentration of pesticide.",

The developed processing scheme consists of four main steps, first a color transformation structure for the input RGB image is created, then the green pixels are masked and removed using specific threshold value followed by segmentation process, the texture statistics are computed for the useful segments, finally the extracted features are passed through the classifier. The proposed algorithm’s efficiency can successfully detect and classify the examined diseases with an accuracy of 94%.

This is the one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field, as having disease in plants are quite natural. If proper care is not taken in this area then it causes serious effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. Plant diseases are extremely significant, as that can adversely affect both quality and quantity of crops in agriculture production. Plant disease diagnosis is very essential in earlier stage in order to cure and control them. Plant diseases can increase the cost of agricultural production and may extend to total economic disaster of a producer if not cured appropriately at early stages. Inspired by the deep learning breakthrough in image-based plant disease recognition, this work proposes deep learning models for image-based automatic diagnosis of plant disease severity. Deep learning algorithm in image can offer an alternative solution in plant monitoring and such an approach may anyway be controlled by a professional to offer his services with lower cost. It includes image segmentation which includes active contour method and image classification approach which includes neural network algorithm to predict various types of diseases. Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is a multilayer neural network consisting of an input layer, minimum one hidden layer and an output layer. As the name of the algorithm implies, the errors (hence, learning) propagate backwards from the output layer to the input layer. Therefore, the process of back propagation is used to estimate weights which minimize the",

        "abstract": "The detection of diseases in rice plants is an essential step in ensuring healthy crop growth and maximizing yields. A real-time and accurate plant disease detection technique can assist in the development of mitigation strategies to ensure food security on a large scale and economical rice crop protection. An accurate classification of rice plant diseases using DL and computer vision could create a foundation to achieve a site-specific application of agrochemicals. Image investigation tools are efficient for the early diagnosis of plant diseases and the continuous monitoring of plant health status. This article presents an Enhanced Sea Horse Optimization with Deep Learning-based Multimodal Fusion for Rice Plant Disease Detection and Classification (ESHODL-MFRPDC) technique. The proposed technique employed a DL-based fusion process with a hyperparameter tuning strategy to achieve an improved rice plant disease detection performance. The ESHODL-MFRPDC approach used Bilateral Filtering (BF)-based noise removal and contrast enhancement as a preprocessing step. Furthermore, Mayfly Optimization (MFO) with a Multi-Level Thresholding (MLT) based segmentation process was used to recognize the diseased portions in the leaf image. A fusion of three DL models was used for feature extraction, namely Residual Network (ResNet50), Xception, and NASNet. The Quasi-Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN) was used for the recognition of rice plant diseases, and its hyperparameters were set using the ESHO method. The performance of the ESHODL-MFRPDC method was validated using the rice leaf disease dataset from the UCI database. An extensive comparison study demonstrated the promising performance of the proposed method over others.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. Early and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases is a vital step in the crop protection system. In traditional practices, identification is performed either by visual observation or by testing in laboratory. The visual observation requires expertise and it may vary subject to an individual which may lead to an error while the laboratory test is time consuming and may not be able to provide the results in time. To overcome these issues, image based machine learning approach to detect and classify plant diseases has been presented in literature. We have focused specifically on rice plant (Oryza sativa) disease in this paper. The images of the diseased symptoms in leaves and stems have been captured from the rice field. We have collected a total of 619 rice plant diseased images from the real field condition belong to four classes:(a) Rice Blast (RB), (b) Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB), (c) Sheat Blight (SB) and (d) Healthy Leave (HL). We have used a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network(CNN) as a feature extractor and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. We have obtained encouraging results. The early identification of rice diseases by this approach could be used as a preventive measure well as an early warning system. Further, it could be extended to develop a rice plant disease identification system on real agriculture field.\n",

Early detection of the paddy diseases and pests at different stages of growth is very crucial in paddy production. However, the current manual method in detecting and classifying the paddy diseases and pests requires a very knowledgeable farmer and time consuming. Thus, this study attempts to utilize an effective image processing and machine learning technique to detect and classify the paddy diseases and pests more accurately and less time processing. To accomplish this study, 3355 images comprises of 4 classes paddy images which are healthy, brown spot, leaf blast, and hispa was used. Then the proposed five layers of CNN technique is used to classify the images. The result shows that the proposed CNN technique is outperform and achieved the accuracy rate up to 93% as compared to other state-of-art comparative models.",

            "abstract": "Rice is a primary food and encounters an essential role in providing food security worldwide. However, several diseases affect this crop that significantly reduces its production and quality. Therefore, early detection of diseases is much needed task to prevent spreading of diseases. Hence, it is desirable to develop an automatic system which will help agronomist, pathologist and even the farmers to diagnose the rice diseases more efficiently and take preventive measures in time. In the present era of advanced artificial intelligence, various learning techniques have been explored for rice plant disease classification. Among various machine learning techniques, deep learning has been widely applied in various domains of computer vision and image analysis recently. It has successfully delivered promising results with large potential. However, training the deep learning model from the scratch requires huge labeled data and collection of huge labeled data is expensive, laborious and time taking process. Transfer learning of pre-trained deep learning model is a technique to overcome such problems. This paper has explored the performance of various pre-trained deep CNN models such as: (i) AlexNet; (ii) Vgg16; (iii) ResNet152V2; (iv) InceptionV3; (V) InceptionResNetV2; (vi) Xception; (vii) MobileNet; (viii) DenseNet169; (ix) NasNetMobile; and (x) NasNetLarge for image based rice plant disease classification. The dataset used in this paper consist of 1216 rice plant diseased images and these have been collected from the real agricultural field having seven classes: (i) rice blast; (ii) bacterial leaf blight; (iii) brown spot; (iv) sheath blight; (v) sheath rot; (vi) false smut; (vii) healthy leaves. The Vgg16 model resulted highest classification accuracy of 93.11%. The outcome of the model can be used as an advisory and as an early detection tool in the real agriculture domain.",

QRNN combines the structural advantages of recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). It takes advantage of RNN’s cyclic connections to deal with the temporal dependencies of the load series, while implementing parallel calculations in both timestep and minibatch dimensions like CNN. The paper detailly describes the design and construction of QRNN, as well as the pre-processing and training steps of the forecasting model. Then, the algorithm is deployed to the big data platform, and an integrated load prediction system integrating data extraction, offline training, online forecasting and data visualization is developed. Finally, the proposed model is compared with some widely used machine learning load forecasting models. The results show that the QRNN based method achieves better prediction accuracy, and greatly improves the computational efficiency of training and testing, which is more practical for real-time and large-scale load forecasting.",

Quality and high production of crops is involved with factors like efficient detection of diseases in the crop. The disease detection though Naked-eye observation of expert can be prohibitively expensive and requires meticulous and scrupulous analysis to detect the disease. The existing systems on disease detection is not efficient enough in terms on real time basis. This paper presents an effective method for identification of paddy leaf disease. The proposed approaches involves pre-processing of input image and the paddy plant disease type is recognized using Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) technique and classifiers namely Artificial Neural Networks is used for better accuracy of detection. This method will be very useful to farmers to detect paddy diseases beforehand and thus prevent over usage of pesticides which in turn affects the crop production",

Consequently, it is imperative to raise agricultural productivity. Among the important factors influencing lower agricultural yields are diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Techniques for detecting plant diseases can be used to control and prevent this. Since deep learning techniques primarily use plant data and provide very effective means of identifying plant ailments, they will be used for the diagnosis of plant diseases. Using deep learning and machine learning based on artificial intelligence (AI), the method offers a thorough assessment of all the methods used in plant disease detection. For our study, we have considered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), MobileNetV2 and Inception V3techniques. Following preprocessing, the models receive 80% of the datasets for training purposes and the remaining 20% for testing. After the disease has been detected, performance analysis and model comparison are carried out. It is found that MobileNetV2 outperforms the other applied approaches, yielding an accuracy of 98.43 %.",

The recent expansion of deep learning methods has found its application in plant disease detection, offering a robust tool with highly accurate results. The current limitations and shortcomings of existing plant disease detection models are presented and discussed in this paper. Furthermore, a new dataset containing 79,265 images was introduced with the aim to become the largest dataset containing leaf images. Images were taken in various weather conditions, at different angles, and daylight hours with an inconsistent background mimicking practical situations. Two approaches were used to augment the number of images in the dataset: traditional augmentation methods and state-of-the-art style generative adversarial networks. Several experiments were conducted to test the impact of training in a controlled environment and usage in real-life situations to accurately identify plant diseases in a complex background and in various conditions including the detection of multiple diseases in a single leaf. Finally, a novel two-stage architecture of a neural network was proposed for plant disease classification focused on a real environment. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 93.67%.",

        "abstract": "Tomato crops are vulnerable to numerous diseases that can severely affect both yield and quality. Early and precise identification of these diseases is indispensable for implementing active management and intervention measures. This research introduces an advanced approach to tomato disease detection by employing the ResNet50 architecture, pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. Through transfer learning, the ResNet50 model leverages its pre-learned features to classify tomato plant images affected by diseases such as Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV), Bacterial Spot, Blossom End Rot, Early Blight, and Late Blight. The ResNet50 model is fine-tuned with custom classification layers tailored to the specific diseases, allowing it to achieve high accuracy in disease detection. Preliminary results indicate that the ResNet50 model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning approaches, demonstrating its efficacy in accurately diagnosing tomato diseases. This study provides an effective solution for improving disease detection in tomatoes and highlights the transformative role of deep learning in advancing agricultural practices, fostering sustainability, and enhancing productivity.",

It helps keep crops healthy and makes farming last longer. Tomato leaf diseases are big problems for farmers and the farming business. Some of the key challenges associated with tomato leaf diseases include: Plant diseases in the leaves of tomato plants directly lead to a decrease in crop production. Diseases like early blight, late blight and bacterial wilt cause leaves to fall off too soon. This results in the plant's ability to grow fruit properly. Diseases in leaves can affect tomatoes by decreasing fruit production with weird shapes and marks. This not only makes the food look bad but can also result in people saying no to buying it and making its worth lower. In the proposed work, we proposed a strong ensemble model that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This helps to accurately identify ten different types of tomato leaf diseases using a learning rate of 0.015, our hybrid model gets an accuracy at 99.8%. The model's performance is shown more by a loss value of 0.032, showing how good it is at finding complicated patterns in the data set. This smart method not only shows the strength of mixing LSTM and CNN designs, but it also helps in improving the classification accuracy of tomato leaf disease detection. It provides a trustworthy tool for farmers and scientists working on growing plants for many kinds of disease detection in tomato plants.",

Our approach—Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classification network or a sequence of words in captioning network) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g.captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g.visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, all without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are robust to adversarial perturbations, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (e) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models learn to localize discriminative regions of input image. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names (Bau et al. in Computer vision and pattern recognition, 2017) to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a ‘stronger’ deep network from a ‘weaker’ one even when both make identical predictions.

MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2% more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 20% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 6.6% more accurate compared to a MobileNetV2 model with comparable latency. MobileNetV3-Large detection is over 25% faster at roughly the same accuracy as MobileNetV2 on COCO detection. MobileNetV3-Large LR-ASPP is 34% faster than MobileNetV2 R-ASPP at similar accuracy for Cityscapes segmentation.",

The proposed visualization method is compared quantitatively with the state-of-the-art methods using Area Over perturbation curve (AOP C). The obtained results shows that the proposed visualization method outperforms the existing methods with AOP C = 0.907.

            "abstract": "Many applications for the automated diagnosis of plant disease have been developed based on the success of deep learning techniques. However, these applications often suffer from overfitting, and the diagnostic performance is drastically decreased when used on test data sets from new environments. In this article, we propose LeafGAN, a novel image-to-image translation system with own attention mechanism. LeafGAN generates a wide variety of diseased images via transformation from healthy images, as a data augmentation tool for improving the performance of plant disease diagnosis. Due to its own attention mechanism, our model can transform only relevant areas from images with a variety of backgrounds, thus enriching the versatility of the training images. Experiments with five-class cucumber disease classification show that data augmentation with vanilla CycleGAN cannot help to improve the generalization, i.e., disease diagnostic performance increased by only 0.7% from the baseline. In contrast, LeafGAN boosted the diagnostic performance by 7.4%. We also visually confirmed that the generated images by our LeafGAN were much better quality and more convincing than those generated by vanilla CycleGAN. The code is available publicly at https://github.com/IyatomiLab/LeafGAN. Note to Practitioners Automated plant disease diagnosis systems play an important role in the agricultural automation field. Building a practical image-based automatic plant diagnosis system requires collecting a wide variety of disease images with reliable label information. However, it is quite labor-intensive. Conventional systems have reported relatively high diagnosis performance, but most of their scores were largely biased due to the “latent similarity” between training and test images, and their true diagnosis capabilities were much lower than claimed. To address this issue, we propose LeafGAN, which generates countless diverse and high-quality training images; it works as an efficient data augmentation for the diagnosis classifier. Such generated images can be used as useful resources for improving the performance of the cucumber disease diagnosis systems.",

            "abstract": "Disease is one of the main factors affecting crop growth. How to reflect the external morphological features of the disease and completely retain the color and texture information of the disease area is one of the key research issues for crop disease segmentation. Meanwhile, aiming at the problem of low segmentation accuracy with traditional convolution neural network-based methods in the crop disease leaf image, this paper proposes a spatial pyramid-oriented encoder-decoder cascade convolution neural network for crop disease leaf segmentation. The network consists of a region disease detection network and a region disease segmentation network. Region disease detection network is a kind of network combining cascade convolution neural network with spatial pyramid. This method connects the three-level convolution neural network model, where the structure of the three-level neural network model varies from simple to complex. Different crop disease leaf features are extracted from the different neural network levels. And images are screened to complete the detection of crop disease leaf. What’s more, a space pyramid pooling layer is added to each network level. This pooling strategy does not require fixed size input, which increases the size selection of input model. The region segmentation network is established based on the Encoder-Decoder structure. The multi-scale convolution kernel is used to improve the local receptive field of the original convolution kernel and accurately segment the crop disease leaf area. Finally, we conduct experiments on the crop disease leaf images under different conditions, the results show that the proposed method has higher segmentation accuracy. In terms of Precision, Correct segmentation, over-segmentation and under-segmentation indexes, etc., the average values of proposed method are more than 90%. The average dice similarity coefficient is over 95% under different background. Moreover, it can meticulously reflect the external morphological features of the crop disease leaf and relatively better retain the color and texture information.",

It is difficult to detect diseases using such an unbalanced dataset. We used DoubleGAN (a double generative adversarial network) to generate images of unhealthy plant leaves to balance such datasets. We proposed using DoubleGAN to generate high-resolution images of unhealthy leaves using fewer samples. DoubleGAN is divided into two stages. In stage 1, we used healthy leaves and unhealthy leaves as inputs. First, the healthy leaf images were used as inputs for the WGAN (Wasserstein generative adversarial network) to obtain the pretrained model. Then, unhealthy leaves were used for the pretrained model to generate 64*64 pixel images of unhealthy leaves. In stage 2, a superresolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) was used to obtain corresponding 256*256 pixel images to expand the unbalanced dataset. Finally, compared with images generated by DCGAN (Deep convolution generative adversarial network). The dataset expanded with DoubleGAN, the generated images are clearer than DCGAN, and the accuracy of plant species and disease recognition reached 99.80 and 99.53 percent, respectively. The recognition results are better than those from the original dataset.",

            "abstract": "This paper introduces EfficientNetV2, a new family of convolutional networks that have faster training speed and better parameter efficiency than previous models. To develop this family of models, we use a combination of training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-MBConv. Our experiments show that EfficientNetV2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while being up to 6.8x smaller. Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e.g., dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast training and good accuracy. With progressive learning, our EfficientNetV2 significantly outperforms previous models on ImageNet and CIFAR/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on the same ImageNet21k, our EfficientNetV2 achieves 87.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ILSVRC2012, outperforming the recent ViT by 2.0% accuracy while training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources.

            "abstract": "In practice, early detection of disease is of high importance to practical value, corresponding measures can be taken at the early stage of plant disease. However, in the early stage of disease or when a rare disease occurs, there are limited training samples in practice, which makes machine learning especially deep learning models hardly work well while the stronger representative ability needs large-scale training data. To solve this problem, a fine grained-GAN based grape leaf spot identification method was proposed for local spot area image data augmentation to the generated local spot area images which were added and fed them into deep learning models for training to further strengthen the generalization ability of the classification models, which can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of the prediction. Including 500 early-stage grape leaf spot images every category were fed into the proposed fine grained-GAN for local spot area data augmentation, 1000 local spot area sub images every category were generated in this study. The improved faster R-CNN was integrated in fine grained-GAN as local spot area detector. After that, the segmented sub-images and generated sub-images were mixed as training data input into the deep learning models, while the original segmented sub-images were used for testing. Experimental results showed that the proposed method had achieved higher identification accuracy on five state-of-art deep learning models; especially ResNet-50 had got 96.27% accuracy, which obtained significant improvements than other data augmentation methods and verified its satisfactory performance. This is of great practical significance for rare diseases or limited training samples.",

To reduce computational cost and improve training results, a dilated convolution capsule network (DCCapsNet) is constructed for apple leaf disease identification based on a capsule network (CapsNet) and two dilated Inception modules with different dilation rates. The network can obtain multi-scale deep-level features to improve the classification capability of the model. The dynamic routing algorithm is used between the front and back layers of CapsNet to make the model converge quickly. In DCCapsNet, dilated Inception instead of traditional convolution is used to increase the convolution receptive fields and extract multi-scale features from disease leaf images, and CapsNet is used to capture the classification features of changeable disease leaves and overcome the overfitting problem in the training network. Extensive experiment results on the apple disease leaf image dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify apple diseases. The method can realize the rapid and accurate identification of apple leaf disease.",

        "title": "Review of Using Various Deep Learning Techniques and Cycle-GANs with Transformer for Disease Detection and Classification in Plant Leaves",
        "abstract": "In the upcoming years, agricultural yields should rise by 50–60 % to assure food security and feed the world's rapidly expanding population. Considering the importance of agriculture, it is imperative to look at methods that can enhance planting practices, track agricultural conditions, identify plant illnesses, and streamline harvesting procedures. The significance of these fundamental elements has prompted in-depth investigation and the creation of numerous studies that offer solutions to these problems. To improve productivity, identifying and preventing plant diseases is crucial. For increased agricultural yields, cost savings, and decreased crop losses, early disease diagnosis is essential. Deep learning and other computer vision-based technologies can help diagnose diseases early. However, the commonality of illness traits in images and interference from the external environment pose hurdles to existing machine vision approaches. Most of the previous work on image classification used plant leaf images captured in controlled environment, having similar background, which produced good results on the same data-set but failed to generalise on the images captured in real conditions. To solve this problem real background images ere used to train the classifiers which increased the generalisation significantly on same data-set but still performed poor on cross data-set generalisation. Attempts are done to solve the problem of data having no background diversity (Background, lighting, camera setting, distance and angle of capture), by data augmentation using GANs, Specifically by using unpaired image to image translation to translate healthy images into diseased images. Earlier models were based on CycleGAN and could not increase the accuracy significantly as CycleGAN translated the latent features also with the disease region. No study within our knowledge has employed Swin transformers in the generator network to augment the CycleGAN model's ability to capture the distribution of the diseased dataset. Furthermore, the use of a transformer-based Image-to-Image translation model reveals issues related to the generation of artifacts, particularly in areas with excessively high or low pixel values. This phenomenon was noted in the present study when applying existing models to plant leaf data augmentation. Thus, by evaluating good fid, psnr, and ssim values using the Swin transformer cycle-GAN, good quality images are obtained and the background diversity issue is resolved. Therefore, classification accuracy is increased by using both actual and produced images to aid in the process. To offer farmers effective solutions for safeguarding their crops and future applications, this paper assesses various methods, delineating their advantages and disadvantages. It proposes the utilization of a hybrid deep learning architecture along with diverse strategies for the detection and classification of plant leaf diseases.",

            "abstract": "Various plant diseases are major threats to agriculture. For timely control of different plant diseases in effective manner, automated identification of diseases are highly beneficial. So far, different techniques have been used to identify the diseases in plants. Deep learning is among the most widely used techniques in recent times due to its impressive results. In this work, we have proposed two methods namely shallow VGG with RF and shallow VGG with Xgboost to identify the diseases. The proposed model is compared with other hand-crafted and deep learning-based approaches. The experiments are carried on three different plants namely corn, potato, and tomato. The considered diseases in corns are Blight, Common rust, and Gray leaf spot, diseases in potatoes are early blight and late blight, and tomato diseases are bacterial spot, early blight, and late blight. The result shows that our implemented shallow VGG with Xgboost model outperforms different deep learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and specificity. Shallow Visual Geometric Group (VGG) with Xgboost gives the highest accuracy rate of 94.47% in corn, 98.74% in potato, and 93.91% in the tomato dataset. The models are also tested with field images of potato, corn, and tomato. Even in field image the average accuracy obtained using shallow VGG with Xgboost are 94.22%, 97.36%, and 93.14%, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Tomato is one of the most essential and consumable crops in the world. Tomatoes differ in quantity depending on how they are fertilized. Leaf disease is the primary factor impacting the amount and quality of crop yield. As a result, it is critical to diagnose and classify these disorders appropriately. Different kinds of diseases influence the production of tomatoes. Earlier identification of these diseases would reduce the disease’s effect on tomato plants and enhance good crop yield. Different innovative ways of identifying and classifying certain diseases have been used extensively. The motive of work is to support farmers in identifying early-stage diseases accurately and informing them about these diseases. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to effectively define and classify tomato diseases. Google Colab is used to conduct the complete experiment with a dataset containing 3000 images of tomato leaves affected by nine different diseases and a healthy leaf. The complete process is described: Firstly, the input images are preprocessed, and the targeted area of images are segmented from the original images. Secondly, the images are further processed with varying hyper-parameters of the CNN model. Finally, CNN extracts other characteristics from pictures like colors, texture, and edges, etc. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model predictions are 98.49% accurate.",

            "abstract": "Global food production is being strained by extreme weather conditions, fluctuating temperatures, and geopolitics. Tomato is a staple agricultural product with tens of millions of tons produced every year worldwide. Thus, preserving the tomato plant from diseases will go a long way in reducing economical loss and boost output. Technological innovations have great potential in facilitating disease detection and control. More specifically, artificial intelligence algorithms in the form of deep learning methods have established themselves in many real-life applications in a wide range of disciplines (e.g., medicine, agriculture, or facial recognition, etc.). In this paper, we aim at applying deep transfer learning in the classification of nine tomato diseases (i.e., bacterial spot, early blight, late blight, leaf mold, mosaic virus, septoria leaf spot, spider mites, target spot, and yellow leaf curl virus) in addition to the healthy state. The approach in this work uses leaf images as input, which is fed to convolutional neural network models. No preprocessing, feature extraction, or image processing is required. Moreover, the models are based on transfer learning of well-established deep learning networks. The performance was extensively evaluated using multiple strategies for data split and a number of metrics. In addition, the experiments were repeated 10 times to account for randomness. The ten categories were classified with mean values of 99.3% precision, 99.2% F1 score, 99.1% recall, and 99.4% accuracy. Such results show that it is highly feasible to develop smartphone-based applications that can aid plant pathologists and farmers to quickly and accurately perform disease detection and subsequent control.",

It contains software, sensors and a bunch of other technologies trying to connect the systems with the purpose of sharing information over the internet. This system is producing massive amounts of data over the internet. This massive amount of data requires an appropriate spectrum to transmit the data to their server. so that it benefits us in an economical way. Machine learning has been successful in fields of speech recognition, graphics, prediction and decision making. Machine learning is used in our research for optimally allocating the resources. Edge computing can be a possible solution for IoT networks because it puts computer capabilities closer to the user. IoT users have recently been created to have more powerful computing abilities, allowing them to run few tasks locally. The article tries to use edge computing with Machine learning for optimal allocation of resources. K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the IoT user into different clusters depending on the distance and feature of their user priority. The cluster of higher priority is executed at the edge level while the lower cluster is executed at the local level. The challenge is to provide a long-term solution for the economical, effective resource allocation in the available spectrum with minimum energy usage. A deep Q-network (DQN) based computational offloading technique is also created to gain knowledge of the appropriate computational offload plan. Furthermore, the DQN-based computational offloading technique surpasses the baseline systems. Through the simulation results, it is concluded that the proposed approach outperforms with the state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "Rice sheath rot disease is a serious threat to rice production that reduces both the amount and quality of one of the most important food crops farmed globally. This study provides a novel approach to detecting Rice Sheath Rot illness using state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. It does this by employing a sizable dataset that was collected from several sources, including agricultural institutions, research centers, and first-hand field observations. Our main goal is to develop a trustworthy and efficient diagnostic tool by utilizing cutting edge machine learning and image processing techniques. Our method for pre-processing images starts with the use of wavelet filters. This technique is crucial for removing noise and enhancing the quality of the dataset, which consists of highdefinition images of rice plants suffering from the Sheath Rot disease. Next, sophisticated feature extraction algorithms are used to assess the ill patches’ color, shape, and texture. These qualities are crucial for distinguishing damaged plant tissues from healthy ones. Our main diagnostic model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which have demonstrated effectiveness in image identification and classification applications. The CNN model is trained using the pre-processed and feature-enhanced information, which enables it to identify the intricate patterns and characteristics linked to Sheath Rot sickness. The model’s architecture is designed to optimize efficiency and precision, ensuring prompt and precise diagnosis of illnesses. The suggested approach uses AI and deep learning to help farmers and agronomists detect infections early on and to significantly advance the field of agricultural disease diagnosis. When combined with waveletfiltered pre-processing and CNN-based analysis, our approach sets a new benchmark for the detection and management of Rice Sheath Rot disease. This might lead to more effective disease control strategies and better crop management practices.",

        "abstract": "This review explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques for detecting pests and diseases in crops, which is a significant challenge in agriculture, leading to substantial yield losses worldwide. This study focuses on the integration of ML models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have shown promise in accurately identifying and classifying plant diseases from images. By analyzing studies published from 2019 to 2024, this work summarizes the common methodologies involving stages of data acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and prediction to develop robust ML models. The findings indicate that the incorporation of advanced image processing and ML algorithms significantly enhances disease detection capabilities, leading to the early and precise diagnosis of crop ailments. This can not only improve crop yield and quality but also reduce the dependency on chemical pesticides, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices. Future research should focus on enhancing the robustness of these models to varying environmental conditions and expanding the datasets to include a wider variety of crops and diseases. CNN-based models, particularly specialized architectures like ResNet, are the most widely used in the studies reviewed, making up 42.36% of all models, with ResNet alone contributing 7.65%. This highlights ResNet’s appeal for tasks that demand deep architectures and sophisticated feature extraction. Additionally, SVM models account for 9.41% of the models examined. The prominence of both ResNet and MobileNet reflects a trend toward architectures with residual connections for deeper networks, alongside efficiency-focused designs like MobileNet, which are well-suited for mobile and edge applications.",

Especially as a modern image processing technology, DL has been successfully applied in various tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and scene analysis. However, with the increase of dense scenes in reality, due to severe occlusions, and small size of objects, the analysis of dense scenes becomes particularly challenging. To overcome these problems, DL recently has been increasingly applied to dense scenes and has begun to be used in dense agricultural scenes. The purpose of this review is to explore the applications of DL for dense scenes analysis in agriculture. In order to better elaborate the topic, we first describe the types of dense scenes in agriculture, as well as the challenges. Next, we introduce various popular deep neural networks used in these dense scenes. Then, the applications of these structures in various agricultural tasks are comprehensively introduced in this review, including recognition and classification, detection, counting and yield estimation. Finally, the surveyed DL applications, limitations and the future work for analysis of dense images in agriculture are summarized.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is dependent on the quality and quantity of plant growth worldwide. Many factors, such as weather, pest attack or disease, can cause plant-specific infections. The process of voluntary diagnosis is a long and laborious process, and the farmer cannot determine the cause and effect of the disease. This study proposes the optimal autocorrelation and classification of crop species (OADD-CS) using hybrid machine learning techniques. The first contribution is to propose a non-linear deep neural network (NL-DNN) for processing before removing abnormal image angles from the input image. Next, the edge target detection (ETD) algorithm is used to calculate the top and bottom leaf edges and extract the feature. Finally, hybrid crow-optimization-based convolutional neural network (HCO-CNN) classifiers are used to diagnose other diseases. Here we consider a dataset of over a million images taken with a mobile phone in real field conditions. This data set includes 17 diseases for 5 crops and 5 equally distributed diseases, with multiple diseases present in the same image. Specific work can be performed on MATLAB tools, and performance is compared to traditional complex work.",

The main threat to food items is from diseases and pests which affect the quality and quantity of food. Different scientific mechanisms have been developed to protect plants and fruits from pests and diseases and to increase the quantity and quality of food. Still these mechanisms require manual efforts and human expertise to diagnose diseases. In the current decade Artificial Intelligence is used to automate different processes, including agricultural processes, such as automatic harvesting. Machine Learning techniques are becoming popular to process images and identify different objects. We can use Machine Learning algorithms for disease identification in plants for automaticharvesting that can help us to increase the quantity of the food produced and reduce crop losses. In this paper, we develop a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can detect diseases in peach plants and fruits. The proposed method can also locate the region of disease and help farmers to find appropriate treatments to protect peach crops. For the detection of diseases in Peaches VGG-19 architecture is utilized. For the localization of disease regions Mask R-CNN is utilized. The proposed technique is evaluated using different techniques and has demonstrated 94% accuracy. We hope that the system can help farmers to increase peach production to meet food demands.",

While most existing models are limited to disease detection on a large scale, the current model addresses the accurate detection of fine-grained, multi-scale early disease detection. The proposed model has been improved to optimize for both detection speed and accuracy and applied to multi-class apple plant disease detection in the real environment. The mean average precision (mAP) and F1-score of the detection model reached up to 91.2% and 95.9%, respectively, at a detection rate of 56.9 FPS. The overall detection result demonstrates that the current algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art detection model with a 9.05% increase in precision and 7.6% increase in F1-score. The proposed model can be employed as an effective and efficient method to detect different apple plant diseases under complex orchard scenarios.",

Different diseases affect plants, which leads to decrease in productivity. In recent years, developments in computing technology and machine-learning algorithms (such as deep neural networks) in the field of agriculture have played a great role to face this problem by building early detection tools. In this paper, we propose an automatic plant disease classification based on a low complexity convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which leads to faster on-line classification. For the training process, we used more than one 57.000 tomato leaf images representing nine classes, taken under natural environment, and considered during training without background subtraction. The designed model achieves 97.04% classification accuracy and less than 0.2 error, which shows a high accuracy in distinguishing a disease from another.",

This paper uses a CenterNet-based object detection method to construct models for plant disease and pest detection. The accuracy of the models is influenced by parameter alpha, which is used to control the affine transformation in the preprocessing of CenterNet. First, different alphas are sampled for training and testing. Next, the least square method is used to fit the curve between alpha and accuracy measured by mAP (mean average precision). Finally, the equation of the curve is fitted as mAP = -0.22 * alpha2 + 0.32 * alpha + 0.42. In comparison, an automated machine learning (AutoML) method is also conducted to automatically search for the best model. The experiments are done with 5,281 images as the training dataset, 1,319 images as the verification dataset, and 3,842 images as the test dataset. The results show that the best alpha value obtained by the least square method is 0.733, and the accuracy of the corresponding model is 0.536 in mAP@[.5, .95]. In contrast, the accuracy of the AutoML method model is higher with the model accuracy of 0.545 in mAP@[.5, .95]. However, the training time and training resource consumption of the AutoML method are about 3 times that of the least square method. Therefore, in practice, a trade-off should be made according to the accuracy requirements, resource consumption, and task urgency.",

            "abstract": "Plant diseases are a severe cause of crop losses in the agriculture globally. Detection of diseases in plants is difficult and challenging due to the lack of expert knowledge. Deep learning-based models provide promising ways to identify plant diseases using leaf images. However, need of larger training sets, computational complexity, and overfitting, etc. are the major issues with these techniques that still need to be addressed. In this work, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed that consists of smaller number of layers leading to lower computational burden. Some augmentation techniques such as shift, shear, scaling, zoom, and flipping are applied to generate additional samples increasing the training set without actually capturing more images. The CNN model is trained for apple crop using a publicly available dataset PlantVillage to identify Scab, Black rot, and Cedar rust diseases in apple leaves. The rigorous experimental results revealed that the proposed model is well fit to identify apple leaf diseases and achieves 98% classification accuracy. It is also evident from the results that it needs lesser amount of storage and takes smaller execution time than several existing deep CNN models. Although, there exist several CNN models for crop disease detection with comparable accuracy, but the proposed model needs lower storage and computational resources. Therefore, it is highly suitable for deploying in handheld devices.",

            "abstract": "Coconut cultivation is a promising agricultural activity. But to keep the coconut plants pest-free, the detection of various pest damage in coconut plants is of utmost importance for the cultivators. The processes that the cultivators use to detect pest damage in coconut plants are conventional methods, experts’ views, or some laboratory techniques. But these procedures are not adequate in the detection of coconut damage identification. In this study, 16 different color and texture features are reported for 1265 coconut pest damage images by extracting the color and texture features of the damage images in the color and grey domain after the damage segmentation using the thresholding technique. The Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) techniques are applied to extract the texture features of the damages and two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures are reported to classify the extracted data features of the damages into 5 different classes such as Eriophyid_Mite, Rhinoceros_Beetle, Red_Palm_Weevil, Rugose_Spiraling_White_fly, and Rugose_in_Mature with an average testing accuracy of almost 100% respectively. To compare the results with the other machine learning techniques, the Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Naïve Bayes (NB) are also introduced for damage identification where the SVM methods also report almost 100% accuracy on the fuse features of GLCM and GLRLM. The results of the ANN and SVM are compared by finding the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and f-1 score of the ANN model with the DT and NB classifier. The ANN and SVM outperform in all matrices and they can be used as the base model for further study of coconut pest damage identification using deep learning techniques.",

Digital image processing is a practice that can help in designing sophisticated high-end machines, which can hold the ophthalmic functionality of the human eye. In agriculture, leaf examination is important for disease identification and fair warning for any deficiency within the plant. Many prominent plant species are facing extinction because of a lack of knowledge. A proper realization of computer vision techniques aid in extracting a significant amount of information from leaf image. This necessitates the requirement of an automatic leaf disease detection method to diagnose disease occurrences and severity, for timely crop management, by spraying pesticides. This study focuses on techniques of digital image processing and machine learning rendered in plant leaf disease detection, which has great potential in precision agriculture.

            "abstract": "Diseases and insect pests of tea leaves cause huge economic losses to the tea industry every year, so the accurate identification of them is significant. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automatically extract features from images of tea leaves suffering from insect and disease infestation. However, photographs of tea tree leaves taken in a natural environment have problems such as leaf shading, illumination, and small-sized objects. Affected by these problems, traditional CNNs cannot have a satisfactory recognition performance. To address this challenge, we propose YOLO-Tea, an improved model based on You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5). Firstly, we integrated self-attention and convolution (ACmix), and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to YOLOv5 to allow our proposed model to better focus on tea tree leaf diseases and insect pests. Secondly, to enhance the feature extraction capability of our model, we replaced the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) module in the original YOLOv5 with the receptive field block (RFB) module. Finally, we reduced the resource consumption of our model by incorporating a global context network (GCNet). This is essential especially when the model operates on resource-constrained edge devices. When compared to YOLOv5s, our proposed YOLO-Tea improved by 0.3%–15.0% over all test data. YOLO-Tea’s AP0.5, APTLB, and APGMB outperformed Faster R-CNN and SSD by 5.5%, 1.8%, 7.0% and 7.7%, 7.8%, 5.2%. YOLO-Tea has shown its promising potential to be applied in real-world tree disease detection systems.",

In this aspect, leaf disease recognition method based on machine learning relies heavily on the size of the region of interest and the dispersion of lesions. Professional instrument for leaf disease detection remains a challenging task in accuracy and convenience. A new lightweight model based on advanced residual network and attention mechanism for extracting more accurate region of interest and the lesion, SE-VRNet, was proposed. The proposed SE-VRNet incorporated deep variant residual network (VRNet) and a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) module with attention mechanism, in order to solve the problem that the feature extraction was difficult due to the dispersed location of the leaf disease. The accuracy of top-1 and top-3 obtained by the model SE-VRNet on NewData is 99.73% and 99.98%, respectively, and the accuracy of top-1 and top-3 obtained by the model on SelfData is 95.71% and 99.89%, respectively.

            "abstract": "This article proposes StrawberryTalk, an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for image-based strawberry disease detection. StrawberryTalk reuses the wall-mounted monitoring cameras without extra hardware cost. The contributions of StrawberryTalk are the utilization of IoT for automatic photo shoot and the wind detection mechanism to eliminate the obscure photos due to the wind effects. Also, the data preprocessing and the infection detection models are manipulated as IoT devices to simplify the implementation of the multicascade artificial intelligence (AI) models. We derive the relationship between the camera zoom factor and the distance between the camera and the strawberries for optimal disease detection. Accuracy of detection may be affected by obscure photos. In terms of eliminating obscure photos due to wind effect, we analytically derive the relationship between the wind alert delay and the number of obscure photos that must be retaken. For the greenhouses in the Bao Mountain, we only need to retake one photo. Based on the experiments, the mean average precision (mAP) of StrawberryTalk (to detect exact spots in a leaf) can be up to 92.37%, which is better than the previous approaches. To detect if a pot has infected leaves, the accuracy of StrawberryTalk can be up to 97.92% at the zoom factor $30\\times $ . In commercial operation, it is important to detect all infected strawberry pots. StrawberryTalk is able to detect all infected pots (i.e., recall is 100%) with a camera of zoom factor of $12\\times $ . The accuracy is 96.88%.",

            "abstract": "As wheat is one of the major crops worldwide, therefore, accurate disease detection in wheat plants is critical for mitigating effects and halting disease spread. Nowadays, the detection of diseases through images using machine learning and deep learning has achieved state-of-art results. Yet these models suffer from two shortcomings, one is the data-hungry models of deep learning, and the second is the adaption of new classes with previous ones, i.e., if a new disease arrived, one must retrain the entire model with a new dataset which has led to the origination of few-shot learning that solves both problems. A wheat disease classification network is proposed based on a few-shot learning method for the classification of 18 wheat diseases using EfficientNet as a backbone. Also, the attention mechanism is incorporated to facilitate efficient feature selection. Our proposed network has achieved 93.19% accuracy on the 40 images of 18 disease classes manually collected from the internet while that of our backbone network EfficientNet has gained an accuracy of about 98.5% accuracy on CGIAR Dataset. The evaluation demonstrates that despite the presence of only a few images in both the training and query sets, the proposed model has achieved superior performance in terms of accuracy and computation cost. Furthermore, the evaluation also highlights the effectiveness of our model in terms of data and computation cost. The proposed method can be used for disease detection in wheat crops requiring less amount of data.",

Six different methods of data augmentation were utilized, including image inversion, gamma correction, noise injection, principal component analysis (PCA), color enhancement, rotation, and scaling. We came to the conclusion that adding more data to a model can improve its accuracy. The proposed model was trained using many epochs, batch sizes, and dropout percentages over the course of its development. When utilizing validation data, the suggested model performs better than methods of transfer learning that are commonly utilized. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of an astounding 83.12% accuracy in data classification. The proposed research is more accurate than the many machine learning technologies that are currently in use.

            "abstract": "Background Specific detection of the type and severity of plant abiotic stresses helps prevent yield loss by considering timely actions. This study introduces a novel method to detect the type and severity of stress in cucumber plants under salinity and drought conditions. Various features, i.e., morphological (image textural features), physiological/biochemical (relative water content, chlorophyll, catalase activity, anthocyanins, phenol content, and proline), as well as miRNA characteristics (the concentration of miRNA-156a, miRNA-166i, miRNA-399g, and miRNA-477b) were extracted from plant leaves, and machine learning methods were used to predict the type and severity of stress by having these features. Support vector machine (SVM) with parameters optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used for machine learning. Results The coefficient of determination of predicting the stress type and severity in plants under both stresses was 0.61, 0.82, and 0.99 using morphological, physiological/biochemical, and miRNA characteristics, respectively. This reveals machine learning methods optimized by metaheuristic optimization techniques can provide specific detection of salt and drought stresses in cucumber plants based on miRNA characteristics. Among the study miRNAs, miRNA-477b and miRNA-399g had the highest and lowest contribution to salt and drought stresses, respectively. Conclusions Comapred to conventional plant traits, miRNAs are more reliable features for providing us with valuable information about plant abiotic diseases at early stages. Using an electrochemical miRNA biosensor similar to one used in this work to measure the miRNA concentration in plant leaves and using a machine learning algorithm such as SVM enable farmers to detect the salt and drought stress at early stages in cucumber plants with very high accuracy.",

Automated extraction of diseased regions from rice leaves is essential for enhancing automated disease identification systems. In this study, we propose an innovative approach that enhances deep learning (DL) segmentation architecture (UNet) by incorporating dilated convolution, EfficientNetB4, and pixelwise logical AND operation. We focus on three prevalent rice diseases: bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, and leaf smut. Manual ground truth mask images are generated for each disease. A comparative analysis demonstrates the superior performance of the modified architectures over their unmodified counterparts. Notably, the modified UNet model stands out, achieving a mean loss of 0.3018 and a mean dice coefficient of 0.6785 which is a significant improvement compared to conventional UNet model.",

Systems for automatically detecting cotton could boost output and efficiency while decreasing costs and waste in cotton growing operations. New cotton detection systems have been developed as a result of recent developments in machine learning and computer vision. These devices can precisely identify and monitor cotton plants using images and sensor data. These systems assess and categorize cotton plants according to their many spectral signatures using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep learning algorithms, and hyperspectral imaging, among other methods. The use of cotton detection technologies can help with problems related to crop diseases, pests, and environmental factors in addition to enhancing crop management and production optimization. Farmers and researchers may spot possible issues early and take corrective action to decrease risks and promote healthy crop growth by offering real-time monitoring and data analytics. As cotton detecting technologies have the potential to alter the cotton farming sector and improve environmentally friendly farming techniques, they represent a promising area for research and development. The proposed pipeline demonstrates how cotton may be recognized quickly and reliably.",

        "abstract": "Crop productivity and food security in modern agriculture are largely dependent on efficient monitoring and early identification of plant diseases. With a focus on the identification of leaf diseases, this study investigates the use of machine learning algorithms in the context of plant health monitoring. To extract pertinent characteristics from photos of plant leaves, the study makes use of sophisticated image processing techniques. This results in a large dataset that can be used to train and assess machine learning models. The proposed approach makes use of a comparison study to assess how well different machine learning algorithms recognise and categorise distinct leaf disease kinds. High-resolution photos of plant leaves displaying disease signs are collected as part of the approach, which also include preprocessing the data to improve feature extraction and utilising labelled datasets to train machine learning models. After that, the models are evaluated on hypothetical data to see how well they generalise and perform in actual situations. In this paper an Ensembled CNN Leaf Disease Detection Classifier (ECNNLDD) used to predict the healthiness of a leaf which classifies whether is healthy or unhealthy which is a 2-class problem and compared with the existing classifier like Decision Tree and SVM algorithm in which the proposed classifier Ensembled CNN Leaf Disease Detection Classifier outperformed when compared with the existing classifiers. The findings of proposed classifier gave the best accuracy in agriculture by offering an intelligent and automated solution for early detection and diagnosis of plant leaf diseases. The integration of Deep learning into plant health monitoring systems holds the potential to revolutionize farming practices, enabling farmers to adopt timely and targeted interventions, thereby minimizing crop losses, and promoting sustainable agriculture.",

            "abstract": "Crop diseases are a major threat to food security, but their rapid identification remains difficult in many parts of the world due to the lack of the necessary infrastructure. The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path toward smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.",

            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

        "abstract": "Plant ailments can threaten farmers' livelihoods and their ability to produce enough food. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective management and control of plant diseases. As leaf is one of the essential part of plants, its analysis can lead to detection of any problem on the plant, its analysis is a promising approach for disease stage prediction, as it can be used to spot minute changes in leaf physiology and appearance that might happen even before the start of obvious symptoms. In this research a machine learning system is introduced that can accurately determine the stage of potato leaf diseases automatically. The model involves steps such, as gathering images preparing them for analysis identifying features combining them and making predictions. By blending features from established models using the suggested Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) the models’ capabilities are enhanced. The utilization of vision transformers aids in making predictions. The model has been tested using a dataset containing images of early blight, late blight and healthy leaves. Through the integration of segmentation and feature fusion techniques this method achieves an accuracy rate of 95.28%. These results validate that the combined framework significantly improves the detection and prediction accuracy of potato plant diseases showing promise, for real world applications.",

            "abstract": "One of Bangladesh’s primary agricultural products is the potato. In recent decades, Bangladesh has seen a surge in the popularity of potato farms. Nonetheless, farmer’s expenses in potato production are rising as a result of a number of illnesses. Nonetheless, the high cost of potato production is mostly attributable to a number of illnesses that are affecting the crop. Which is wreaking havoc on the farmer’s schedule. In order to modernize the potato industry and speed up disease diagnosis, automation has been implemented. In spite of the claims to the contrary, potato leaf disease is a serious problem that can severely reduce crop yields. The leaves of diseased potato plants will show symptoms of early blight, Septoria blight, late blight, and other diseases. If such outbreaks are discovered at the initial level and enough intervention is done, the farmer will not be at risk of incurring significant economic losses. Based on the results of this study, a new model is presented for accurately identifying and detecting illnesses in potato leaf stands using image processing. While there are several methods that may be utilized in machine learning, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is what’s being employed here to identify the disease in potato leaf photos. This work implements a CNN based sequential model to predict the disease of potato leaves. This research achieved 94.2% model accuracy on this model. The presented model was tested on both typical and disordered potato leaves in an effort to distinguish between the two. Next, the algorithm is applied to the images, and the potato tree’s leaf is classified as either healthy or unhealthy.",

            "abstract": "Tea production is a crucial agricultural sector in India that significantly contributes to the country's economy. India is recognized as the world's top tea consumer and the second-largest producer of tea. This industry provides both direct and indirect employment to millions of individuals, especially those residing in rural areas, where it serves as a primary source of income. The growing popularity of deep learning has led to a significant increase in research interest in image recognition technologies, particularly in fields such as computerized image classification and the detection of plant diseases. Each year India produces a huge amount of tea leading to an increase in the economy. However, there is also a vast volume of tea waste because of the tea leaf disease which is required to be resolved to keep the constant industry's success. Diseases affecting tea leaves can impact their growth rate, thus affecting the crop's overall yield. Therefore, this study aims to develop a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) model to diagnose tea plant diseases using a collection of leaf images. CNN is an ideal model for this application as it can effectively analyze both tea leaves and other plant leaves to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method has analyzed the tea leaf images which achieved an accuracy rate of 84% along with a very less error rate which is 16% by using the “ADAM” optimizer. Furthermore, in the future, the images can also be enhanced with augmentation methods to achieve better results.",

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used in this project's automated approach to better detect damaged tomato leaves using image processing. First, a sizable dataset with tagged photos of both healthy and diseased leaves is gathered from sources such as the Plant Village collection. To increase the diversity and quality of data, preprocessing techniques like data augmentation, scaling, and standardization are used. To guarantee accuracy and robustness, the CNN model is trained on well-labeled datasets after extracting complex features from the images. Techniques like batch normalization and dropout help reduce overfitting. Metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model's performance, showing significant improvements over conventional methods. With potential for wider uses in precision farming, the findings show that CNNs are a viable tool for the early and precise diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases. In order to enhance performance across a range of crops and diseases, future research will concentrate on transfer learning and growing datasets.

        "abstract": "This research describes the creation of a sophisticated system that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with traditional image processing methods to identify pests and illnesses on plant leaves. The primary goal is to increase agricultural output by facilitating early identification and offering prompt treatment suggestions, which will lower crop losses. The system initially employs traditional image processing methods to identify the edges of leaves, improve image contrast, and detect anomalies such as black spots, pests, and other foreign objects. These methods utilize various techniques, including color space conversion (from BGR to HSV), adaptive thresholding, morphological operations, and contour detection, which help the system isolate and highlight potential problem areas on the leaf. Although these traditional methods are effective, they have limitations in accurately detecting complex patterns, especially under varying lighting conditions and across different leaf types. To address these difficulties, the project incorporates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are advanced machine learning models that can autonomously acquire and extract characteristics from large collections of leaf pictures. The CNN model is trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes photos of both healthy and sick leaves. Data augmentation methods are used to enhance its resilience. The model’s architecture comprises convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for detection. A comparative analysis between the CNN-based approach and traditional image processing methods demonstrates significant enhancements in accuracy, robustness, and scalability. The CNN model is particularly effective in identifying even subtle disease patterns and pests, offering a more adaptable and thorough solution for real-time leaf disease detection. This system is valuable for farmers, facilitating early intervention and more effective pest and disease management in crops.",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi play essential roles in many application fields, like biotechnique, medical technique and industrial domain. Microorganism counting techniques are crucial in microorganism analysis, helping biologists and related researchers quantitatively analyze the microorganisms and calculate their characteristics, such as biomass concentration and biological activity. However, traditional microorganism manual counting methods, such as plate counting method, hemocytometry and turbidimetry, are time-consuming, subjective and need complex operations, which are difficult to be applied in large-scale applications. In order to improve this situation, image analysis is applied for microorganism counting since the 1980s, which consists of digital image processing, image segmentation, image classification and suchlike. Image analysis-based microorganism counting methods are efficient comparing with traditional plate counting methods. In this article, we have studied the development of microorganism counting methods using digital image analysis. Firstly, the microorganisms are grouped as bacteria and other microorganisms. Then, the related articles are summarized based on image segmentation methods. Each part of the article is reviewed by methodologies. Moreover, commonly used image processing methods for microorganism counting are summarized and analyzed to find common technological points. More than 144 papers are outlined in this article. In conclusion, this paper provides new ideas for the future development trend of microorganism counting, and provides systematic suggestions for implementing integrated microorganism counting systems in the future. Researchers in other fields can refer to the techniques analyzed in this paper.",

The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be used in smart farming to improve the standard of agriculture. The foundation of the Indian economy, agriculture, contributes to the country's overall economic growth. Yet, because of the usage of antiquated farming technology and the fact that individuals from rural areas now go to urban areas for more lucrative businesses rather than concentrating on agriculture, the obtained productivity is quite low compared to global standards. This artificial intelligence assists in increasing crop productivity and identifies or keeps track of crop illnesses. based on artificial intelligence to identify crop or leaf diseases, a robot or equipment has been created. It distinguishes or categorizes the plant as either disease-affected or unaffected. Image segmentation is a technique used to isolate the specific disease's affected area. This system's classification of diseased leaves offers farmers a better course of action.

Crop pests also disrupt agricultural production. So, this paper proposes leaf disease, disease severity stage, and pest detection strategies with suggestions for prevention strategies using five notable Convolutional Neural Network models (CNN) such as VGG16, Resnet50, AlexNet, EfficientNetB2, and EfficientNetB3. This paper uses a dataset of tomato leaves consisting of 41,763 images which cover 10 classes of tomato disease, and a dataset of pests consisting of 4,271 images which cover 8 classes of pests. Firstly, these models are used for the classification of diseases and pests. Then disease and pest prevention techniques are shown. For disease and pest detection, EfficientNetB3 gives the best accuracy for training (99.85%), (99.80%), and validation (97.85%), (97.45%) respectively. For severity stage identification, AlexNet gives the best accuracy for training (69.02%) and validation (72.49%).",

            "abstract": "The tomato crop is an important staple in the Indian market with high commercial value and is produced in large quantities. Diseases are detrimental to the plant's health which in turn affects its growth. To ensure minimal losses to the cultivated crop, it is crucial to supervise its growth. There are numerous types of tomato diseases that target the crop's leaf at an alarming rate. This paper adopts a slight variation of the convolutional neural network model called LeNet to detect and identify diseases in tomato leaves. The main aim of the proposed work is to find a solution to the problem of tomato leaf disease detection using the simplest approach while making use of minimal computing resources to achieve results comparable to state of the art techniques. Neural network models employ automatic feature extraction to aid in the classification of the input image into respective disease classes. This proposed system has achieved an average accuracy of 94–95 % indicating the feasibility of the neural network approach even under unfavourable conditions.",

Image segmentation can play an important role not only in image segmentation but also in plant leaf or fruit disease detection. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid intelligent algorithm (GAACO) including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACO) and Tabu list for different types of images segmentation as well as plant leaf or fruit image segmentation and transductive support vector machine (TSVM) is used to detect diseases of plant leaf or fruit. In this process, Genetic Algorithm is used to search for most optimal cluster centers in the problem space and then the Ant Colony Optimization is employed to achieve the best solution. Tabu list is used to save the image pixels into the memory. After image segmentation, the transductive support vector machine is used in testing phase and the obtained testing samples are compared with training samples. However, plant leaf disease or fruit disease detection is done by TSVM in accordance with leaf or fruit feature extraction. The result of the proposed algorithm shows that the hybrid GAACO algorithm gives high performance with a very low computational complexity, helps to enhance segmentation accuracy and supports TSVM to find the accurate diseases.",

Firstly, the method uses a two-dimensional filtering mask combined with a weighted multilevel median filter (2DFM-AMMF) for noise reduction, and uses a faster two-dimensional Otsu threshold segmentation algorithm (Faster 2D-Otsu) to reduce the interference of complex background with the detection of target blade in the image. Then the dynamic population firefly algorithm based on the chaos theory as well as the maximum and minimum distance algorithm is applied for optimization of the K-Means clustering algorithm (FCM-KM) to determine the optimal clustering class k value while addressing the tendency of the algorithm to fall into the local optimum problem. Combined with the R-CNN algorithm for the identification of rice diseases, FCM-KM analysis is conducted to determine the different sizes of the Faster R-CNN target frame. As revealed by the application results of 3010 images, the accuracy and time required for detection of rice blast, bacterial blight and blight were 96.71%/0.65s, 97.53%/0.82s and 98.26%/0.53s, respectively, indicating clearly that the method is more capable of detecting rice diseases and improving the identification accuracy of Faster R-CNN algorithm, while reducing the time required for identification.",

Early diagnosis of crop diseases is essential since they influence the growth of their species. Crop disease detection and classification has traditionally relied on a variety of Machine Learning (ML) models, and developments in a type of ML called Deep Learning (DL), this field of study seems to offer a lot of promise for increased accuracy. The suggested method effectively and precisely recognizes the symptoms of crop disease using a CNN and a deep neural network. Additionally, these solutions are evaluated using a variety of efficiency indicators. The DL models that are used to visualize agricultural diseases are fully described in this article.

Meanwhile, nutrition and the world economy depend on the growth of grains and vegetables. Many farmers are cultivating in remote areas of the world with the lack of accurate knowledge and disease detection, however, they rely on manual observation on grains and vegetables, as a result, they are suffering from a great loss. Digital farming practices can be an interesting solution for easily and quickly detecting plant diseases. To address such issues, this paper proposes plants leaf disease detection and preventive measures technique in the agricultural field using image processing and two well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) models as AlexNet and ResNet-50. Firstly, this technique is applied on Kaggle datasets of potato and tomato leaves to investigate the symptoms of unhealthy leaf. Then, the feature extraction and classification process are performed in dataset images to detect leaf diseases using AlexNet and ResNet-50 models with applying image processing. The experimental results elicit the efficiency of the proposed approach where it achieves the overall 97% and 96.1 % accuracy of ResNet-50 and the overall 96.5% and 95.3% accuracy of AlexNet for the classification of healthy-unhealthy leaf and leaf diseases, respectively. Finally, a graphical layout is also demonstrated to provide a preventive measures technique for the detected leaf diseases and to acquire a rich awareness about plant health.",

Recent significant deep learning progress for image recognition has raised strong research interest in medical image recognition. First of all, we found the prediction result using the VGG16 model on failed pneumonia X-ray images. Thus, this paper proposes IVGG13 (Improved Visual Geometry Group-13), a modified VGG16 model for classification pneumonia X-rays images. Open-source thoracic X-ray images acquired from the Kaggle platform were employed for pneumonia recognition, but only a few data were obtained, and datasets were unbalanced after classification, either of which can result in extremely poor recognition from trained neural network models. Therefore, we applied augmentation pre-processing to compensate for low data volume and poorly balanced datasets. The original datasets without data augmentation were trained using the proposed and some well-known convolutional neural networks, such as LeNet AlexNet, GoogLeNet and VGG16. In the experimental results, the recognition rates and other evaluation criteria, such as precision, recall and f-measure, were evaluated for each model. This process was repeated for augmented and balanced datasets, with greatly improved metrics such as precision, recall and F1-measure. The proposed IVGG13 model produced superior outcomes with the F1-measure compared with the current best practice convolutional neural networks for medical image recognition, confirming data augmentation effectively improved model accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Smart farming system using necessary infrastructure is an innovative technology that helps improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production in the country including tomato. Since tomato plant farming take considerations from various variables such as environment, soil, and amount of sunlight, existence of diseases cannot be avoided. The recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for camera-assisted disease diagnosis for tomato. This study developed the innovative solution that provides efficient disease detection in tomato plants. A motor-controlled image capturing box was made to capture four sides of every tomato plant to detect and recognize leaf diseases. A specific breed of tomato which is Diamante Max was used as the test subject. The system was designed to identify the diseases namely Phoma Rot, Leaf Miner, and Target Spot. Using dataset of 4,923 images of diseased and healthy tomato plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases or absence thereof. The system used Convolutional Neural Network to identify which of the tomato diseases is present on the monitored tomato plants. The F-RCNN trained anomaly detection model produced a confidence score of 80 % while the Transfer Learning disease recognition model achieves an accuracy of 95.75 %. The automated image capturing system was implemented in actual and registered a 91.67 % accuracy in the recognition of the tomato plant leaf diseases.",

            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves, with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge, this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images in order to create a database, assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe, a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre, was used to perform the deep CNN training. The experimental results on the developed model achieved precision between 91% and 98%, for separate class tests, on average 96.3%.",

Early detection and effective management of these diseases are essential for mitigating their detrimental effects on agricultural output. However, traditional methods of disease monitoring and diagnosis are often costly and require continuous expert intervention. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach that combines image processing techniques and advanced machine learning methodologies for the accurate identification and classification of rice leaf diseases. By utilizing datasets comprising images of diseased rice leaves, environmental data, and historical disease reports, the proposed system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis and feature extraction. Subsequently, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is employed for disease detection and classification based on the extracted features. The integration of image processing and machine learning technologies offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for early disease detection and management in agriculture. By automating the process of disease identification, the proposed system facilitates timely interventions, thereby minimizing crop losses and promoting agricultural sustainability.",

Deep learning, the latest breakthrough in computer vision, is promising for fine-grained disease severity classification, as the method avoids the labor-intensive feature engineering and threshold-based segmentation. Using the apple black rot images in the PlantVillage dataset, which are further annotated by botanists with four severity stages as ground truth, a series of deep convolutional neural networks are trained to diagnose the severity of the disease. The performances of shallow networks trained from scratch and deep models fine-tuned by transfer learning are evaluated systemically in this paper. The best model is the deep VGG16 model trained with transfer learning, which yields an overall accuracy of 90.4% on the hold-out test set. The proposed deep learning model may have great potential in disease control for modern agriculture.",

Blasts in paddy leaves are the most predominant disease which appears as brown spots on the leaves. If not treated on time, it may cause the great loss. Excessive use of pesticide for treatment of plant diseases increases the cost, environmental pollution and decreases the production. So their use must be optimized. This can be achieved by targeting the disease places, with the appropriate quantity and concentration of pesticide by estimating disease severity using image processing technique. In this paper K- means clustering method has been used to segment the image into three images based on color. Among these images unaffected leaf regions and disease affected regions are used to calculated percentage of affected pixels. By calculating percentage of affected pixels disease severity can be observed which leads to take appropriate measure for treatment.",

While many similar studies have been conducted on datasets of images to predict plant diseases, the main objective of this study is to suggest classification methods that can be used for disease classification and prediction in datasets that contain raw measurements instead of images. A fungus and a plant dataset, which had many differences, were chosen so that the findings in this paper could be applied to future research for disease prediction and classification in a variety of datasets which contain raw measurements. A key difference between the two datasets, other than one being a fungus and one being a plant, is that the mushroom dataset is balanced and only contained two classes while the soybean dataset is imbalanced and contained eighteen classes. All six algorithms performed well on the mushroom dataset, while the Artificial Neural Network and k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms performed best on the soybean dataset. The findings of this paper can be applied to future research on disease classification and prediction in a variety of dataset types such as fungi, plants, humans, and animals.",

Agriculture is hugely important to humans as a food source. As a result, plant diseases detection has become a major concern. Traditional methods for identifying plant disease are available. However, agriculture professionals or plant pathologists have traditionally employed empty eye inspection to detect leaf disease. This approach of detecting plant leaf disease traditionally can be subjective, time-consuming, as well as expensive, and requires a lot of people and a lot of information about plant diseases. It is also possible to detect plant leaf diseases using an experimentally evaluated software solution. Currently, machine learning and deep learning are using in recent years. The agriculture sector is also not a exception for machine learning. In this paper, we applied \"Convnets\" for plant disease detection and classification. We collected a PlantViallge dataset from Kaggle. It contains images of 15 different classes of plant leaves of three different plants potato, pepper, tomato. We divided the dataset into three datasets and applied Convnets on three datasets. We achieved an accuracy of 98.3%,98.5%,95% for potato plant disease detection, pepper plant disease detection, tomato plant disease detection. Experimental results have shown that our model achieved a good accuracy rate for plant leaf disease detection and classification.",

        "abstract": "Global Coconut (Cocos nucifera (L.)) cultivation faces significant challenges, including yield loss, due to pest and disease outbreaks. In particular, Weligama Coconut Leaf Wilt Disease (WCWLD) and Coconut Caterpillar Infestation (CCI) damage coconut trees, causing severe coconut production loss in Sri Lanka and nearby coconut-producing countries. Currently, both WCWLD and CCI are detected through on-field human observations, a process that is not only time-consuming but also limits the early detection of infections. This paper presents a study conducted in Sri Lanka, demonstrating the effectiveness of employing transfer learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Mask Region-based-CNN (Mask R-CNN) to identify WCWLD and CCI at their early stages and to assess disease progression. Further, this paper presents the use of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection model to count the number of caterpillars distributed on leaves with CCI. The introduced methods were tested and validated using datasets collected from Matara, Puttalam, and Makandura, Sri Lanka. The results show that the proposed methods identify WCWLD and CCI with an accuracy of 90% and 95%, respectively. In addition, the proposed WCWLD disease severity identification method classifies the severity with an accuracy of 97%. Furthermore, the accuracies of the object detection models for calculating the number of caterpillars in the leaflets were: YOLOv5-96.87%, YOLOv8-96.1%, and YOLO11-95.9%.",

This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves, with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge, this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images in order to create a database, assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe, a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre, was used to perform the deep CNN training. The experimental results on the developed model achieved precision between 91% and 98%, for separate class tests, on average 96.3%.",

Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition. Code will be made available.",

            "abstract": "Coconut palm (Cocos nucifera), is a major and economically important plantation crop widely cultivated in Sri Lanka. A sudden outbreak of a rapidly spreading non-lethal syndrome was first reported in coconut palms from southern Sri Lanka in 2006. This syndrome was named Weligama coconut leaf wilt disease (WCLWD) as it occurred in the Weligama area. WCLWD symptoms are flaccidity and marginal necrosis of leaflets and intense yellowing of the fronds, similar to the Kerala wilt disease of coconut in India. As the disease progresses the crown becomes smaller, the trunk begins to taper and the palm becomes unproductive. Abiotic factors and extra-cellular pathogens were discarded as the cause of WCLWD. Considering that a phytoplasma was previously associated with Kerala wilt disease, the possible phytoplasma aetiology of WCLWD was investigated. DNA extracted from midribs of spear leaves was subjected to nested PCR with phytoplasma universal primers R16F2n/R16R2 and R16mF2/R16R2 nested with fU5/rU3; P1/P7 nested with Chrfor/rU3; and direct PCR with Pc399/P1694. PCR products of expected sizes were obtained from diseased but not from healthy palms from a disease-free area. The sequences generated from the PCR products were submitted to similarity search (BlastN) in the NCBI database which confirmed that a phytoplasma belonging to the 16SrXI ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma oryzae’ group is associated with WCLWD. The phytoplasma was found to be highly similar but not identical to Sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma (99%), Sugarcane grassy shoot phytoplasma (99%) and Kerala wilt phytoplasma (99%).",

Similarly, in Sri Lanka, 6.9% of the national GDP is contributed by the agricultural sector and more than 25% of Sri Lankans are employed in the field of agriculture. But the frequent fluctuations of climate conditions have caused the spread of diseases such as late blight which eventually has led to the devastation of entire plantations of Sri Lankans. To this end, this paper proposes to forecast the possible dispersion pattern and assist the farmers in identifying the possibility of the disease getting dispersed to nearby crops to provide early warning. Eventually, it leads the farmers to take precautions to save the plants before reaching a critical stage. The yielded results show that the proposed method successfully performed disease diagnosis and disease progression level identification with 90-94% accuracy and dispersion pattern analysis.",

In this paper, an automatic extraction algorithm is proposed for crop images based on Mask RCNN. First, the Fruits 360 Dataset label is set with Labelme. Then, the Fruits 360 Dataset is preprocessed. Next, the data are divided into a training set and a test set. Additionally, an improved Mask RCNN network model structure is established using the PyTorch 1.8.1 deep learning framework, and path aggregation and features are added to the network design enhanced functions, optimized region extraction network, and feature pyramid network. The spatial information of the feature map is saved by the bilinear interpolation method in ROIAlign. Finally, the edge accuracy of the segmentation mask is further improved by adding a micro-fully connected layer to the mask branch of the ROI output, employing the Sobel operator to predict the target edge, and adding the edge loss to the loss function. Compared with FCN and Mask RCNN and other image extraction algorithms, the experimental results demonstrate that the improved Mask RCNN algorithm proposed in this paper is better in the precision, Recall, Average precision, Mean Average Precision, and F1 scores of crop image extraction results.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. Agriculture is a crucial sector for every country’s economy, as it provides livestock and crops that are essential for farmers and their families’ survival. Crop diseases significantly impact farmers’ livelihood, making early detection and accurate diagnosis essential for informed crop management decisions that can improve yield and crop quality. While the manual diagnosis of plant diseases has limitations, research on automatic plant disease identification and categorization using computer vision algorithms is a popular research topic. We focus on leaf disease recognition and compare classification techniques to object detection techniques. Classification techniques in leaf disease recognition involve assigning an input image of a leaf to one of the pre-defined classes or categories, such as “healthy” or “diseased.” Object detection techniques, on the other hand, involve identifying the presence of an object of interest (e.g., a leaf) in an image and locating its boundaries, in addition to classifying the object. The advantage of object detection techniques over classification techniques in leaf disease recognition is that they provide additional information about the location of the disease on the leaf, which can be useful for tasks such as disease diagnosis and monitoring. In our work, 5100 chilli leaf images of 6 different classes were collected and labeled using the makeSense artificial intelligence (AI) annotating tool; we applied the YOLOv5s object detection model, producing a precision of 0.951, recall of 0.926, mAP@0.5 of 0.959, mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.826, and accuracy of 95%. We also proposed an enhanced single-stage object detection model that employs the exponential linear unit activation function in the convolution layers and the sigmoid activation function at the output layer, resulting in a precision of 0.998, recall of 0.998, mAP@0.5 of 0.995, mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.975, and accuracy of 99.83% for the chilli leaf dataset.",

This fungus attacks the tender tea shoots, resulting in a direct negative impact on the tea harvest. This paper presents a system to identify the suspicious tea leaves and BB disease at its early stages along with an assessment of severity, offering a potential solution to this critical issue. By utilizing real-time object detection, the system filters out non-tea leaves from the captured initial image of a segment of a tea plant. The identified tea leaves are then subjected to BB identification and severity assessment based on differing visual symptoms of the BB stages. This approach enables the system to accurately identify BB in the initial stage and severity stage, allowing for timely and targeted intervention to minimize crop losses. The YOLOv8 model has been able to correctly identify 98% of the objects it has detected as relevant (precision), and it has been able to correctly identify 96% of all the relevant objects present in the scene (recall). The Residual Network 50 (Resnet50) convolutional neural network (CNN) model was selected as the final model, achieving an accuracy of 89.90% during the training phase and an accuracy of 88.26% during the testing phase.",

Pests and illnesses cause both qualitative and quantitative losses in crop production. While automatic in-field pest detection using a computer vision approach is an important part of modern intelligent agriculture, there are still significant challenges to be overcome. These include the complexity of the natural environment, the detection of tiny size pests, and the classification into several classes of pests. The proposed method consists of four stages: image preprocessing, segmentation, GLCM, and analysis. Model training and feature extraction. Image preprocessing techniques allow for the processing of a still image and the creation of an image improvement approach. The segmentation procedure makes use of grayscale insert images. A feature extraction tool that makes good use of the Gray level co-occurrence matrix. The models are then trained via Mask R-CNN, after information gain has been used to choose relevant features. CNN and RPN, two of the most common substitutes, are both outperformed by the proposed strategy.",

        "abstract": "—Farmers' primary concern is to reduce crop loss because of pests and diseases, which occur irrespective of the cultivation process used. Worldwide more than 40% of the agricultural output is lost due to plant pathogens, insects, and weed pests. Earlier farmers relied on agricultural experts to detect pests. Recently Deep learning methods have been utilized for insect pest detection to increase agricultural productivity. This paper presents two deep learning models based on Faster RCNN Efficient Net B4 and Faster R-CNN Efficient Net B7 for accurate insect pest detection and classification. We validated our approach for 5, 10, and 15 class insect pests of the IP102 dataset. The findings illustrate that our proposed Faster R-CNN Efficient Net B7 model achieved an average classification accuracy of 99.00 %, 96.00 %, and 93.00 % for 5, 10, and 15 class insect pests outperforming other existing models. To detect insect pests less computation time is required for our proposed Faster-R-CNN method. The investigation reveals that our proposed Faster R-CNN model can be used to identify crop pests resulting in higher agricultural yield and crop protection.",

            "abstract": "Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a widely used algorithm in pattern recognition, classification, and prediction fields. Among a number of neural networks, backpropagation neural network (BPNN) has become the most famous one due to its remarkable function approximation ability. However, a standard BPNN frequently employs a large number of sum and sigmoid calculations, which may result in low efficiency in dealing with large volume of data. Therefore to parallelize BPNN using distributed computing technologies is an effective way to improve the algorithm performance in terms of efficiency. However, traditional parallelization may lead to accuracy loss. Although several complements have been done, it is still difficult to find out a compromise between efficiency and precision. This paper presents a parallelized BPNN based on MapReduce computing model which supplies advanced features including fault tolerance, data replication, and load balancing. And also to improve the algorithm performance in terms of precision, this paper creates a cascading model based classification approach, which helps to refine the classification results. The experimental results indicate that the presented parallelized BPNN is able to offer high efficiency whilst maintaining excellent precision in enabling large-scale machine learning.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse crop production is growing throughout the world and early pest detection is of particular importance in terms of productivity and reduction of the use of pesticides. Conventional eye observation methods are nonefficient for large crops. Computer vision and recent advances in deep learning can play an important role in increasing the reliability and productivity. This paper presents the development and comparison of two different approaches for vision based automated pest detection and identification, using learning strategies. A solution that combines computer vision and machine learning is compared against a deep learning solution. The main focus of our work is on the selection of the best approach based on pest detection and identification accuracy. The inspection is focused on the most harmful pests on greenhouse tomato and pepper crops, Bemisia tabaci and Trialeurodes vaporariorum. A dataset with a huge number of infected tomato plants images was created to generate and evaluate machine learning and deep learning models. The results showed that the deep learning technique provides a better solution because (a) it achieves the disease detection and classification in one step, (b) gets better accuracy, (c) can distinguish better between Bemisia tabaci and Trialeurodes vaporariorum, and (d) allows balancing between speed and accuracy by choosing different models.",

Compared to traditional R-CNN, and its accelerated version SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains networks using a multi-task loss in a single training stage. The multi-task loss simplifies learning and improves detection accuracy. Unlike SPPnet, all network layers can be updated during fine-tuning. We show that this difference has practical ramifications for very deep networks, such as VGG16, where mAP suffers when only the fully-connected layers are updated. Compared to\"slow\"R-CNN, Fast R-CNN is 9x faster at training VGG16 for detection, 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a significantly higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate.

To construct video detection system for plant diseases and pests, and to build a real-time crop diseases and pests video detection system in the future, a deep learning-based video detection architecture with a custom backbone was proposed for detecting plant diseases and pests in videos. We first transformed the video into still frame, then sent the frame to the still-image detector for detection, and finally synthesized the frames into video. In the still-image detector, we used faster-RCNN as the framework. We used image-training models to detect relatively blurry videos. Additionally, a set of video-based evaluation metrics based on a machine learning classifier was proposed, which reflected the quality of video detection effectively in the experiments. Experiments showed that our system with the custom backbone was more suitable for detection of the untrained rice videos than VGG16, ResNet-50, ResNet-101 backbone system and YOLOv3 with our experimental environment.",

However, it is difficult for farmers to accurately identify each type of insect pest, and yet they have used a large number of pesticides indiscriminately, causing serious environmental pollution. Meanwhile, spraying pesticides is very expensive, and thus developing a system to identify crop-damaging pests early will help farmers save a lot of money while also contributing to the development of sustainable agriculture. This paper presents a new efficient deep learning system for real-time insect image recognition on mobile devices. Our system achieved an accuracy of mAP@0.5 with the YOLOv5-S model of 70.5% on the 10 insect dataset and 42.9% on the IP102 large-scale insect dataset. In addition, our system can provide more information to farmers about insects such as biological characteristics, distribution, morphology, and pest control measures. From there, farmers can take appropriate measures to prevent pests and diseases, helping reduce production costs and protecting the environment.",

        "abstract": "Agriculture is the mainstream to keep pace in the Bangladeshi economy. Plant disease became a threat to food security as it is a very important factor to deteriorate the quality and quantity of harvest. Therefore, it is important to detect the plant diseases early which results in interrupting from falling the massive destruction of harvest. But, an erroneous diagnosis of the disease results in the inappropriate use of pesticides. In order to enhance the production quality and quantity, a deep learning-based approach is proposed to detect the tomato leaf diseases, and then classify the types of the disease using image dataset. This proposed approach trained two model architectures: inception V3 and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Inception V3 performs well and reaches a success rate with a 96.11% in order to identify whether the specific plant leaf is infected or healthy. The success rate is significant and makes this approach as a very useful way or early forewarning tool, and this approach might be an essential system to operate real agriculture fields. As the detection accuracy is recorded as 94.72% for CNN. We confirm that it achieves the experimental results with 94.72% and 96.11% for the detection and classification of infected leaves from dataset for CNN and Inception V3 respectively. 1",

At the genomic level, advances in technologies for the high-throughput analysis of gene expression have made it possible to begin discriminating responses to different biotic and abiotic stressors and potential trade-offs in responses. At the scale of the individual plant, enough experiments have been performed to begin synthesizing the effects of climate variables on infection rates, though pathosystem-specific characteristics make synthesis challenging. Models of plant disease have now been developed to incorporate more sophisticated climate predictions. At the population level, the adaptive potential of plant and pathogen populations may prove to be one of the most important predictors of the magnitude of climate change effects. Ecosystem ecologists are now addressing the role of plant disease in ecosystem processes and the challenge of scaling up from individual infection probabilities to epidemics and broader impacts.",

We demonstrate a system capable of automatically identifying NLB lesions in field-acquired images of maize plants with high reliability. This approach uses a computational pipeline of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that addresses the challenges of limited data and the myriad irregularities that appear in images of field-grown plants. Several CNNs were trained to classify small regions of images as containing NLB lesions or not; their predictions were combined into separate heat maps, then fed into a final CNN trained to classify the entire image as containing diseased plants or not. The system achieved 96.7% accuracy on test set images not used in training. We suggest that such systems mounted on aerial- or ground-based vehicles can help in automated high-throughput plant phenotyping, precision breeding for disease resistance, and reduced pesticide use through targeted application across a variety of plant and disease categories.",

        "abstract": "Plant diseases pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity and food security in Bangladesh. In this research, we address the challenge of timely and accurate plant disease detection through the application of transfer learning with deep neural models. We curated a diverse dataset comprising 18 categories of plant leaf images, including Bell pepper Bacterial spot, Bell pepper Healthy, Peach Healthy, Potato Early Blight, Rice Leaf Blast, Rice Healthy, Rice Brown Spot, Potato Healthy, Peach Bacterial spot, Corn Blight, Potato Late blight, Corn Healthy, Tomato Bacterial spot, Strawberry Leaf Scorch, Tomato Early blight, Tomato Early blight, Strawberry Healthy, and Tomato Healthy. The dataset represents the most prevalent plant diseases observed in the Bangladeshi context. We employed three state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, EfficientNetV2M, VGG-19, and NASNetLarge, to develop robust plant disease detection models. Through transfer learning, these pre-trained models were fine-tuned on our specialized dataset to adapt them for the task at hand. The performance evaluation revealed impressive results, with EfficientNetV2M achieving an accuracy rate of 99%, VGG-19 achieving 93%, and NASNetLarge attaining 83% accuracy. The high accuracy of EfficientNetV2M showcases its exceptional capability in accurately classifying plant diseases prevalent in Bangladesh. The success of these deep neural models in detecting various plant diseases signifies their potential in revolutionizing plant disease management and enhancing agricultural practices. Our research contributes valuable insights into the effective use of transfer learning for plant disease detection and emphasizes the significance of dataset curation for improved model performance. The developed models hold promise in providing timely and precise disease diagnosis to farmers and agricultural professionals, thereby facilitating prompt interventions and minimizing crop losses. Future research can explore the integration of these deep neural models into practical agricultural tools, enabling real-time disease detection and offering substantial benefits to the agricultural industry in Bangladesh.",

The bacterial spot, late blight, septoria leaf spot and yellow curved leaf diseases affect the crop quality of tomatoes. Automatic methods for classification of plant diseases also help taking action after detecting the symptoms of leaf diseases. This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm based method for tomato leaf disease detection and classification. The dataset contains 500 images of tomato leaves with four symptoms of diseases. We have modeled a CNN for automatic feature extraction and classification. Color information is actively used for plant leaf disease researches. In our model, the filters are applied to three channels based on RGB components. The LVQ has been fed with the output feature vector of convolution part for training the network. The experimental results validate that the proposed method effectively recognizes four different types of tomato leaf diseases.",

Since tomato plant farming take considerations from various variables such as environment, soil, and amount of sunlight, existence of diseases cannot be avoided. The recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for camera-assisted disease diagnosis for tomato. This study developed the innovative solution that provides efficient disease detection in tomato plants. A motor-controlled image capturing box was made to capture four sides of every tomato plant to detect and recognize leaf diseases. A specific breed of tomato which is Diamante Max was used as the test subject. The system was designed to identify the diseases namely Phoma Rot, Leaf Miner, and Target Spot. Using dataset of 4,923 images of diseased and healthy tomato plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases or absence thereof. The system used Convolutional Neural Network to identify which of the tomato diseases is present on the monitored tomato plants. The F-RCNN trained anomaly detection model produced a confidence score of 80 % while the Transfer Learning disease recognition model achieves an accuracy of 95.75 %. The automated image capturing system was implemented in actual and registered a 91.67 % accuracy in the recognition of the tomato plant leaf diseases.",

Its contribution to the development of Indian economy has immense potential. So agriculture products may play vital role for economic growth. But the different kind of diseases in plant decreases the production of crops and growth rate of farmers. To identify and monitor the leaf diseases manually by farmers is very difficult. This is one of the reasons to develop an automatic leaf diseases detection model. The proposed model helps in automatic detection of different plant diseases at early stages. Thus, the production will increase in many folds. The main aim of this study is to identify different types of leaf diseases. Different feature extraction techniques have been used to enhance the classification accuracy. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Logistic Regression have been applied to classify different types of leaf diseases. When obtained results are compared SVM outperforms other two classifiers. Results show that, the model can be used in real life applications.",

Computer vision and machine learning based approaches have gained huge attraction in digital image processing field. Several visual computing based techniques have been presented in the past for early prediction of plant leaf diseases. However, detection accuracy is still considered as a challenging task. Hence, in order to overcome this issue, we introduce a novel hybrid approach carried out in three forms. During the first phase, image enhancement and image conversion scheme are incorporated, which helps to overcome the low-illumination and noise related issues. In the next phase, a combined feature extraction technique is developed by using GLCM, Complex Gabor filter, Curvelet and image moments. Finally, a Neuro-Fuzzy Logic classifier is trained with the extracted features. The proposed approach is implemented using MATLAB simulation tool where PlantVillage Database is considered for analysis. The average detection accuracy has been obtained as more than 90% for 2 test cases which shows that the proposed combination of feature extraction and image pre-processing process is able to obtain improved classification accuracy. This work is useful for the students of UG/PG programme to carry out Project-based learning.",

            "abstract": "In this research, we proposed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model for image-based plant leaf disease identification using data augmentation and hyperparameter optimization techniques. The DCNN model was trained on an augmented dataset of over 240,000 images of different healthy and diseased plant leaves and backgrounds. Five image augmentation techniques were used: Generative Adversarial Network, Neural Style Transfer, Principal Component Analysis, Color Augmentation, and Position Augmentation. The random search technique was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed DCNN model. This research shows the significance of choosing a suitable number of layers and filters in DCNN development. Moreover, the experimental outcomes illustrate the importance of data augmentation techniques and hyperparameter optimization techniques. The performance of the proposed DCNN was calculated using different performance metrics such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. The experimental results show that the proposed DCNN model achieves an average classification accuracy of 98.41% on the test dataset. Moreover, the overall performance of the proposed DCNN model was better than that of advanced transfer learning and machine learning techniques. The proposed DCNN model is useful in the identification of plant leaf diseases.",

        "abstract": "Farmer suicides in India had ranged between 1.4 and 1.8 per hundred thousand people, accounting to 11.2 % of all suicides in India due to reasons like debt, low produce prices, crops failure and alcohol addiction. Among these, crop failure is attributed to various factors including unpredictable weather conditions, poor farming practices, pests and diseases along withill use of fertilizers and late disease diagnosis. Various systems have been proposed and implemented for immediate identification of the disease, using mobile devices for disease identification and consequent action, but the majority of proposed approaches involve segmentation techniques coupled with classical machine learning algorithms, which focused on the entire plant or fruit image, not primarily on the diseased part, thus embedding pixels which introduce possible bias in each data point leading to an imprecise training dataset and consequently faulty training. In this paper we propose a method of leveraging a combination of clustering based segmentation for identification of the diseased part exclusively and consequent feature extraction over it along with using neural networks over classical algorithms, thereby increasing feature complexity and thus better training, increasing training accuracy and leaving scope for further integration of huge amount of data which can added later on.",

A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's (1982) algorithm. We present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation.",

It is characterized by silvery lesions on the tuber surface which result in a deterioration in skin quality. In addition to causing tuber blemish symptoms, C. coccodes also causes symptoms on stems and foliage, resulting in crop losses in some countries, and is implicated as a factor in the potato early dying disease complex. In the past, the incidence and severity of black dot might have been underestimated, as tuber symptoms were often mistaken for silver scurf (Helminthosporium solani). Inoculum of C. coccodes can be both seed tuber- and soilborne, and disease control is difficult as there are few chemical control methods and little resistance in commercial cultivars. Cultural control options offer the only potential means to control this disease at present.

Therefore, in the agriculture field, detection of plants disease plays a main role. If proper care of plants is not taken then it causes serious effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. In some countries farmers don’t have proper facilities or even idea that they can contact to experts. Due to this consulting experts costs high. Manual monitoring the plant leaf disease is very critical task and also time consuming too .The results obtained are also not satisfactory. Automatic disease detection technique is beneficial at initial stage for detecting disease. If automatic disease detection technique is used then it will take less effort, less time and also gives more accurate results. Disease detection system involves the steps like image acquisition, image pre-processing",

        "abstract": "Agriculture as a source of food is essential for humankind. Therefore, the diagnosis of plant diseases is a significant concern. Plant disease diagnosis through plant monitoring is necessary for maintainable agriculture. Observing plant diseases automatically is very challenging. Managing plant diseases requires a lot of effort and expertise. Traditionally, identifying plant foliar disease is subjective, inefficient, and expensive, requiring a large number of personnel and a large amount of information about plant disease. This novel uses a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach for plant disease identification to tackle this problem. First, collect the dataset from online Kaggle and pre-process images to remove noise in the first phase. Then Logistic Decision Regression (LDR) method was utilized for feature selection in the pre-processed plant image. After that, we apply segmentation based on selected features. Finally, our proposed method proficiently classifies the plant's disease based on segment images. Therefore, this approach produces high disease detection accuracy and specificity with a minimum error rate compared to different methods.",

            "abstract": "Data hiding, a form of steganography, is one of the emerging techniques that embeds secret data into a digital media and thus ensures secured data transfer. In this paper, the steganographic method used, is based on audio steganography which is concerned with embedding secret data in an audio file. The basic idea of proposed method is that the host signal (the sound wave cover media) undergoes preprocessing, and then the results takes the shape of an image in which the data can be securely hidden in the image layers. The secret data is then hidden in a preprocessed sound wave using a traditional steganographic technique. The least significant-bit (LSB) based technique are very popular for steganography in spatial domain. The simplest LSB technique simply replaces the LSB in the cover image with the bits from secret information. Further advanced techniques use some criteria to identify the pixels in which LSB(s) can be replaced with the bits of secret information. In DCT based technique insertion of secret information in carrier depends on the DCT coefficients. Any DCT coefficient value above proper threshold is a potential place for insertion of secret information .The proposed methods offers high quality of steganography process in terms of Peak Signal–to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Only minor changes in the contents of the audio file occur, which are indiscernible to human ears. In addition, several attacks on the sound wave were performed; the results showed that the hidden secret data can be retrieved with minimal distortion. An implementation of both these methods and their performance analysis has been done in this paper.",

These defects bring a tremendous negative influence on the quality and quantity of crop yield. In order to prevent the plant leaves from getting destroyed, a better solution is needed to protect them from the beginning stage. Several works have been proposed to recognize and plant diseases. In this paper, a review is conducted to analyze the results of works based on detection of plant leaf diseases using machine learning and deep learning models. Based on the results, a transfer learning model with better performance is to be implemented along with the Jetson Nano kit for faster and efficient processing.

            "abstract": "Crop plant diseases are a significant threat to productivity and sustainable development in agriculture. Early prediction of disease attacks is useful for the effective control of the disease by taking proactive actions against their attacks. Modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have a predominant role in Precision Agriculture (PA) applications to support sustainable developments. There is an immense need for solutions for the early prediction of the disease attack for proactive control against the plant disease attack. The present solution of disease detection using the computer vision approach can only detect the existence of the disease once the disease has already appeared. This study aims to propose a Machine Learning (ML) approach for the early prediction of the probability of disease attack based on Internet of Things (IoT) directly sensed crop field environmental conditions. Plant disease life cycles are strongly correlated with environmental conditions. The crop field environmental conditions are used to predict the occurrence of plant diseases. The Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is applied as the ML model due to the existence of a linear relationship between disease attack and environmental conditions. Internet of Things (IoT) based crop field environmental conditions help to accurately predict the occurrence of plant diseases using the ML approach. The proposed model is implemented for the prediction of blister blight (Exobasidium vexans) for tea (Camellia sinensis) plant to check the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The implementation of the proposed model from 2015 to 2019 reveals that the accuracy of prediction of occurrence of the disease reached up to 91% in 2019.",

        "title": "Image segmentation for pest detection of crop leaves by improvement of regional convolutional neural network",
        "abstract": "Pest detection is important for crop cultivation. Crop leaf is the main place of pest invasion. Current technologies to detect crop pests have constraints, such as low efficiency, storage demands and limited precision. Image segmentation is a fast and efficient computer-aided detection technology. High resolution image capture solidly supports the crucial processes in discerning pests from images. Study of analytical methods help parse information in the images. In this paper, a regional convolutional neural network (R-CNN) architecture is designed in combination with the radial bisymmetric divergence (RBD) method for enhancing the efficiency of image segmentation. As a special application of RBD, the hierarchical mask (HM) is produced to endorse detection and classification of the leaf-dwelling pests, offering enhanced efficiency and reduced storage requirements. Moreover, to deal with some mislabeled data, a threshold variable is introduced to adjust a fault-tolerant mechanism into HM, to generate a novel threshold-based hierarchical mask (TbHM). Consequently, the hierarchical mask R-CNN (HM-R-CNN) model and the threshold-based hierarchical mask R-CNN (TbHM-R-CNN) model are established to detect various types of healthy and pest-invasive crop leaves to select the regional image features that are rich in pest information. Then simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) method is incorporation to finish the image segmentation for the classification of pest invasion. The models are tuned and optimized, then validated. The most optimized modeling results are from the TbHM-R-CNN model, with the classification accuracy of 96.2%, the recall of 97.5% and the F1 score of 0.982. Additionally, the HM-R-CNN model observed appreciable results second only to the best model. These results indicate that the proposed methodologies are well-suited for training and testing a dataset of plant diseases, offering heightened accuracy in pest classification. This study revealed that the proposed methods significantly outperform the existing techniques, marking a substantial improvement over current methods.",

            "title": "Computational Deep Intelligence Vision Sensing for Nutrient Content Estimation in Agricultural Automation",
            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel computational intelligence vision sensing approach to estimate nutrient content in wheat leaves by analyzing color features of the leaves images captured on field with various lighting conditions. We propose the development of deep sparse extreme learning machines (DSELM) fusion and genetic algorithm (GA) to normalize plant images as well as to reduce color variability due to a variation of sunlight intensities. We also apply the DSELM in image segmentation to differentiate wheat leaves from a complex background. In this paper, four moments of color distribution of the leaves images (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) are extracted and utilized as predictors in the nutrient estimation. We combine a number of DSELMs with committee machine and optimize them using the GA to estimate nitrogen content in wheat leaves. The results have shown the superiority of the proposed method in the term of quality and processing speed in all steps, i.e., color normalization, image segmentation, and nutrient prediction, as compared with other existing methods. Note to Practitioners—In order to support precision farming technology and agricultural automation, it is very essential to estimate the nutrient content in plants to prevent over fertilizing that will harm environment. Furthermore, the existing method to determine nutrient content in leaves is destructive as well as time consuming and requires special expertise to operate expensive devices. A number of methods have been developed to estimate nutrient content in leaves nondestructively based on the color features of the leaves. Most of these methods, however, are conducted in a controlled environment with artificial lighting. Such methods are not practical and need various equipment. We propose a low-cost, simple, and accurate technique to estimate nitrogen content in wheat leaves by analyzing RGB color of the leaves images. In this paper, we found that the developed DSELMs fusion has enabled better performance in normalizing images and is faster than other neural network types, i.e., backpropagation-based multilayer perceptron and original extreme learning machine. In image segmentation step, the established DSELM shows good performance to recognize and distinguish wheat leaves from other undesired background images. Furthermore, the developed weighted DSELMs have demonstrated enhanced ability in estimating nutrient content.",

            "abstract": "Reliable estimation of the ventilation rate (VR) in intensive livestock buildings is necessary for studying building environmental control strategies and predicting indoor air quality and air emissions. As direct air exchange measurements are time-consuming and expensive, it is environmentally inefficient to measure livestock building VR continuously in practice. Hence, indirect VR estimation methods have been widely used in modelling environmental control and air emissions, and also to measure airflow in the field. The accuracy of indirect measurement methods needs to be evaluated by comparing with direct measurements. In this study, the direct and indirect methods of determining hourly and daily mean VRs were applied to a mechanically-ventilated dairy free stall barn monitored by the 24-month National Air Emissions Monitoring Study. The direct method was used to continuously monitor fan rotational speeds, and differential static pressures, coupled with periodic in-situ fan performance assessments, to calculate the VR. The indirect method consisted of estimating the VR using CO2 concentration measurements and the CO2 mass balance method. The average daily and hourly means (mean±SD) of directly measured barn ventilation rates for two years were (246±73) m3/s and (245±77) m3/s, respectively. The average daily and hourly means (mean±SD) of barn ventilation rates estimated by the CO2 mass balance method were (287±93.4) m3/s and (287±118) m3/s, respectively. Correlation analyses showed a strong correlation between the indirect CO2 mass balance method and direct measurement methods (r=0.93 for daily means and r=0.85 for hourly means). \nKeywords: dynamic ventilation rate, modern dairy, free stall barn, carbon dioxide, mass balance, dairy cow, direct and indirect determination, comparison \nDOI: 10.25165/j.ijabe.20201306.5767 \n \nCitation: Zou B, Heber A J, Shi Z X, Du S H, Jin Y, Lim T T.

            "abstract": "By combining the basics of self-similarity, scaling correlation, and statistical components, Benoit Mandelbrot formulated the idea of a natural fractal entity, an entity described by those fundamentals. As a result of these principles, fractal image codings are being used in many substantial applications already, such as image compression, image signature, image watermarking, image attribute extraction, and even image texture segmentation. Thus, while fractal image coding is relatively new in the field of image encoding, it has gained broad acceptance at a rapid pace. In light of its beneficial qualities, such as quick decomposition, high compression ratio, and the independence of resolution at any size make these applications conceivable. However, compared to its advantages, fractal image coding is extremely time-complex and so remarkably expensive, which hinders its prevalence. A wide hunting domain blocks for the relevant range blocks caused this difficulty. We proposed several improvements to the Jacquin design in this paper. We first used max-pooling as an alternative for the medium bonding of spatial contractions to validate the value of the edge textures of the block. Secondly, we construct the odd-size pixel block alternative to an even-size pixel block for validation of the symmetric central pixel (CP). Finally, before the search started, we proposed a shortening of block space, using the central pixel of the block to convert each eight-bit pixel to a two-bit pixel. As a consequence, the symmetrical CP of odd pixels block, reduction of block space, and edge pixel selection accomplished faster coding and competitive image quality than existing known exhaustive search algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Background: Field pea, Pisum sativum L. is an important winter-season pulse crop. It is subjected to damage by both field and storage insect pests and approximately 10-15 per cent reduction in yield was reported due to the infestation of different insect pests. Among these, pulse aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch.) affects plant physiology directly by removal of nutrients or indirectly by dispersal of various viral diseases. The present investigation has been aimed to study the seasonal fluctuations of aphids and their natural enemies as well as their correlation. Another objective was to know the effect of various weather parameters on pulse aphids and their natural enemies which ultimately would be helpful to develop a forewarning model.Methods: The field experiment was conducted at the A-B Block Farm of Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Nadia, West Bengal using two varieties of field pea (KPMR 935 and IFPD 122) during rabi seasons of two consecutive years of 2017-18 and 2018-19 following a Randomized Block Design with three replications. After recording the total population of both pests (nymphs and adults) and their natural enemies across the season, the mean population was worked out and used for correlation and regression studies along with the weather parameters. Result: Maximum aphid population was noticed during the peak pod formation stage of the crop irrespective of the varieties. The pest population was very strongly correlated with the incidence of coccinellid and ant population in both test varieties. Among the weather parameters, both maximum and minimum temperature and sunshine hour showed a positive correlation with the pest population and their natural enemies but relative humidity and rainfall showed a negative correlation. Regression studies indicated that temperature and relative humidity were the most influencing factors over the incidence of aphid in both the seasons.",

            "abstract": "Investment castings often have surface impurities, and pieces of shell moulds can remain on the surface after sandblasting. Identification of defects involves time-consuming manual inspections in working environments of high noise and poor air quality. To reduce labour costs and increase the health and safety of employees, automated optical inspection (AOI) combined with a deep learning framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was applied for the detection of sandblasting defects. Four classic CNN models, including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-34, were applied for training and predictive classification. A comprehensive comparison reveals that AlexNet, VGG-16, and GoogLeNet v1 could accurately determine whether there were defects. Among the four models, AlexNet and VGG-16 were the most accurate, with prediction accuracy of 99.53% and 99.07% for qualifying products and both 100% for defective products. GoogLeNet v4 and ResNet-34 did not perform as expected in defect prediction. The reasoning behind the poor performance of GoogLeNet v4 and ResNet-34 is attributed to the restrictedness of the investment casting dataset to use models with residual learning architectures. Finally, a direct detection technique based on the AOI and CNN structure with a fast and flexible computational interface was demonstrated.",

            "abstract": "Abstract. Recent technological development in the computer vision field has provided opportunities for agriculture applications. The field of computer vision allows a machine to “see,” providing an alternative to using the human eye to identify, measure, and track a target in image processing. Computer vision technology uses a sensor, camera, and computer. The carrot is one of the most important vegetables in the world, and a grading scale for carrots will improve market competitiveness. In marketing and carrot processing, carrot grading plays a major part. Existing approaches using the traditional carrot grading system, which requires manual involvement, are inefficient and labor-intensive. The computer vision feature parameters of the carrot, such as its length, average diameter, maximum diameter, aspect ratio, perimeter, and area, are extracted, along with RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color parameters. These 12 computer vision parameters are given as input to a recognition model using the proposed optimized cascaded graph convolutional neural network with Bayesian optimization. The statistical results of the experiments performed with this model show that the proposed recognition system with computer vision feature parameters can grade carrots accurately.",

            "abstract": "The present study aimed to estimate the antiviral activities of Ginkgo biloba (GB) leaves extract and eco-friendly free silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) against the MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) and HCoV-229E (human coronavirus 229E), as well as isolation and identification of phytochemicals from GB. Different solvents and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to extract and identify flavonoids and phenolic compounds from GB leaves. The green, silver nanoparticle synthesis was synthesized from GB leaves aqueous extract and investigated for their possible effects as anti-coronaviruses MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E using MTT assay protocol. To verify the synthesis of Ag NPs, several techniques were employed, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scan, transmission electron microscopy, FT-IR, and UV–visible spectroscopy. The highest contents of flavonoids and phenolic compounds were recorded for acetone, methanol, and ethanol as mixtures with water, in addition to pure water. HPLC flavonoids were detected as apegenin, luteolin, myricetin, and catechin, while HPLC phenolic compounds were pyrogallol, caffeic acid, gallic acid, and ellagic acid. In addition, our results revealed that Ag NPs were produced through the shift from yellow to dark brown. TEM examination of Ag NPs revealed spherical nanoparticles with mean sizes ranging from 5.46 to 19.40 nm and an average particle diameter of 11.81 nm. A UV–visible spectrophotometric investigation revealed an absorption peak at λ max of 441.56 nm. MTT protocol signified the use of GB leaves extract as an anti-coronavirus to be best from Ag NPs because GB extract had moderate anti-MERS-CoV with SI = 8.94, while had promising anti-HCov-229E, with an SI of 21.71. On the other hand, Ag NPs had a mild anti-MERS-CoV with SI = 4.23, and a moderate anti-HCoV-229E, with an SI of 7.51.",

            "abstract": "PurposeHistopathology biopsy imaging is currently the gold standard for the diagnosis of breast cancer in clinical practice. Pathologists examine the images at various magnifications to identify the type of tumor because if only one magnification is taken into account, the decision may not be accurate. This study explores the performance of transfer learning and late fusion to construct multi-scale ensembles that fuse different magnification-specific deep learning models for the binary classification of breast tumor slides.Design/methodology/approachThree pretrained deep learning techniques (DenseNet 201, MobileNet v2 and Inception v3) were used to classify breast tumor images over the four magnification factors of the Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification dataset (40×, 100×, 200× and 400×). To fuse the predictions of the models trained on different magnification factors, different aggregators were used, including weighted voting and seven meta-classifiers trained on slide predictions using class labels and the probabilities assigned to each class. The best cluster of the outperforming models was chosen using the Scott–Knott statistical test, and the top models were ranked using the Borda count voting system.FindingsThis study recommends the use of transfer learning and late fusion for histopathological breast cancer image classification by constructing multi-magnification ensembles because they perform better than models trained on each magnification separately.Originality/valueThe best multi-scale ensembles outperformed state-of-the-art integrated models and achieved an accuracy mean value of 98.82 per cent, precision of 98.46 per cent, recall of 100 per cent and F1-score of 99.20 per cent.",

This study aimed to construct deep learning models using mask regional convolutional neural network (Mask-RCNN) for AD identification in full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and evaluate the performance of models for malignant AD diagnosis. Methods This retrospective diagnostic study was conducted at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between January 2011 and December 2020. Patients with AD in the breast in FFDM were included. Machine learning models for AD identification were developed using the Mask RCNN method. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, their areas under the curve (AUCs), and recall/sensitivity were used to evaluate the models. Models with the highest AUCs were selected for malignant AD diagnosis. Results A total of 349 AD patients (190 with malignant AD) were enrolled. EfficientNetV2, EfficientNetV1, ResNext, and ResNet were developed for AD identification, with AUCs of 0.89, 0.87, 0.81 and 0.79. The AUC of EfficientNetV2 was significantly higher than EfficientNetV1 (0.89 vs. 0.78, P=0.001) for malignant AD diagnosis, and the recall/sensitivity of the EfficientNetV2 model was 0.93. Conclusion The Mask-RCNN-based EfficientNetV2 model has a good diagnostic value for malignant AD.",

Therefore, the accurate and automatic identification of pests is crucial for the agricultural industry. However, traditional methods of pest classification are limited, as they face difficulties in identifying pests with subtle differences and dealing with sample imbalances. To address these issues, we propose a pest classification model based on data enhancement and multi-feature learning. The model utilizes Mobile Inverted Residual Bottleneck Convolutional Block (MBConv) modules for multi-feature learning, enabling it to learn diverse and rich features of pests. To improve the model’s ability to capture fine-grained details and address sample imbalances, data enhancement techniques such as random mixing of pictures and mixing after region clipping are used to augment the training data. Our model demonstrated excellent performance not only on the large-scale pest classification IP102 dataset but also on smaller pest datasets.",

            "abstract": "Variations in monthly precipitation are associated with climate extremes having significant socio‐economic and eco‐environmental impacts. Knowledge of monthly precipitation information is therefore valuable for policy making. Extensive research has been conducted on dynamic prediction using state‐of‐the‐art coupled climate models. However, the skilful prediction of monthly precipitation with dynamical models remains a challenge. With the development of machine learning tools, statistical predictions show comparable performance with dynamic models, but they are limited to at‐site monthly prediction, due to the lack of ability for processing spatially connected geophysical data. To improve monthly precipitation forecasting and provide regional forecasts, we propose a model termed UNet‐RegPre based on convolutional neural network and U‐net architecture. The model shows comparable prediction skills with recurrent state‐of‐the‐art dynamic forecasts (CFSv2), and has the capability to capture spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and reproduce the main process of representative droughts. The key precursors for rainfall development identified by UNet‐RegPre shows that the constructed model can detect the climatic connection between rainfall in eastern China and summer monsoon, showing the potential to advance hydrometeorological understanding with a deep learning‐based model. These results suggest that the proposed model can be a potential tool for precipitation prediction.",

            "abstract": "Sooty mold is a common disease found in citrus plants and is characterized by black fungi growth on fruits, leaves, and branches. This mold reduces the plant’s ability to carry out photosynthesis. In small leaves, it is very difficult to detect sooty mold at the early stages. Deep learning-based image recognition techniques have the potential to identify and diagnose pest damage and diseases such as sooty mold. Recent studies used advanced and expensive hyperspectral or multispectral cameras attached to UAVs to examine the canopy of the plants and mid-range cameras to capture close-up infected leaf images. To bridge the gap on capturing canopy level images using affordable camera sensors, this study used a low-cost home surveillance camera to monitor and detect sooty mold infection on citrus canopy combined with deep learning algorithms. To overcome the challenges posed by varying light conditions, the main reason for using specialized cameras, images were collected at night, utilizing the camera’s built-in night vision feature. A total of 4200 sliced night-captured images were used for training, 200 for validation, and 100 for testing, employed on the YOLOv5m, YOLOv7, and CenterNet models for comparison. The results showed that YOLOv7 was the most accurate in detecting sooty molds at night, with 74.4% mAP compared to YOLOv5m (72%) and CenterNet (70.3%). The models were also tested using preprocessed (unsliced) night images and day-captured sliced and unsliced images. The testing on preprocessed (unsliced) night images demonstrated the same trend as the training results, with YOLOv7 performing best compared to YOLOv5m and CenterNet. In contrast, testing on the day-captured images had underwhelming outcomes for both sliced and unsliced images. In general, YOLOv7 performed best in detecting sooty mold infections at night on citrus canopy and showed promising potential in real-time orchard disease monitoring and detection. Moreover, this study demonstrated that utilizing a cost-effective surveillance camera and deep learning algorithms can accurately detect sooty molds at night, enabling growers to effectively monitor and identify occurrences of the disease at the canopy level.",

These technologies hold the promise of redefining sports performance analysis, automating data collection, creating immersive training environments, and enhancing decision-making processes. Traditionally, performance analysis in sports relied on manual data collection, subjective observations, and standard statistical models. These methods, while effective, had limitations in terms of time and subjectivity. However, recent advances in technology have ushered in a new era of objective and real-time performance analysis. AI has revolutionized sports analysis by streamlining data collection, processing vast datasets, and automating information synthesis. VR introduces highly realistic training environments, allowing athletes to train and refine their skills in controlled settings. AR overlays digital information onto the real sports environment, providing real-time feedback and facilitating tactical planning. DV techniques convert complex data into visual representations, improving the understanding of performance metrics. In this paper, we explore the potential of these emerging technologies to transform sports performance analysis, offering valuable resources to coaches and athletes. We aim to enhance athletes’ performance, optimize training strategies, and inform decision-making processes. Additionally, we identify challenges and propose solutions for integrating these technologies into current sports analysis practices. This narrative review provides a comprehensive analysis of the historical context and evolution of performance analysis in sports science, highlighting current methods’ merits and limitations.

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have had remarkable success in classifying a variety of plant diseases through deep learning. However, just a few researches have shed light on the inference process, leaving it as an unsolvable mystery. In addition to guaranteeing the learnt feature's dependability, revealing the CNN to extract it in an understandable form enables human intervention-based verification of the model's veracity and the training dataset. Using a CNN that had been trained using a public ally accessible collection of images depicting plant diseases, several neuron-wise and layer-wise visualisation techniques were used in this study. We demonstrated that neural networks can, when diagnosing an illness, capture the hues and textures of lesions particular to that disease, which is similar to human judgement. The most critical aspect of agriculture is striking a balance between produce and population. Due to a variety of issues, including natural disasters, unforeseen rainfall, nutrient deficiencies in the soil, etc., the majority of farmers failed to produce and balance the crops. The main issue, however, is pest infection, which is the root of all the issues. To learn about plant diseases, several researchers employed a variety of methods. Convolutional neural network-based deep learning techniques are frequently utilised to solve image-oriented problems. A powerful and successful method for image analysis is the CNN (ConvNet) neural network model of deep learning. In this study, various models for plant disease detection with CNN are compared. The research report concludes by summarising its findings, identifying its limitations, and making recommendations for classification",

            "abstract": "With the aggressive growth of the internet of things-based applications in the domestic and industrial domain, the embedded static memory is also under renovation stage to eliminate classical barriers such as soft errors, poor stability, and mediocre performance. In this work, a novel twelve transistors (12T) SRAM cell is presented that replaces the conventional inverter with Schmitt trigger-based inverter in core latch. The proposed SRAM circuit has been compared with four formerly reported designs for investigating the improvement in terms of various performance metrics. These designs include conventional six transistors (6T), tunable transistor 8T (T8T), PPN inverter-based 10T (PP10T), and stable low read power 11T (S11T) cells. The presented cell effectively minimizes the soft errors attributed to [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] enhancement of critical charge compared to 6T/T8T/PP10T/S11T cells. Also, the proposed bit-cell effectively mitigates multi-bit-cell upsets because it allows bit interleaving array structure. The presented bit-cell also shows reduction in leakage power by [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] in comparison to 6T/T8T/PP10T/S11T cells, respectively. The read and write stability of proposed bit-cell circuit is enhanced by [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text], respectively, in comparison to 6T/T8T/PP10T/S11T cells, respectively. In addition to this, proposed cell exhibits improvement in dynamic power, data retention voltage, and overall electrical quality matrix. Variability comparison of key design metrics such as read power and read current of the proposed SRAM circuit with 6T cell has also been presented in this work.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is crucial to the economic prosperity and development of India. Plant diseases can have a devastating influence towards food safety and a considerable loss in the production of agricultural products. Disease identification on the plant is essential for long-term agriculture sustainability. Manually monitoring plant diseases is difficult due to time limitations and the diversity of diseases. In the realm of agricultural inputs, automatic characterization of plant diseases is widely required. Based on performance out of all image-processing methods, is better suited for solving this task. This work investigates plant diseases in grapevines. Leaf blight, Black rot, stable, and Black measles are the four types of diseases found in grape plants. Several earlier research proposals using machine learning algorithms were created to detect one or two diseases in grape plant leaves; no one offers a complete detection of all four diseases. The photos are taken from the plant village dataset in order to use transfer learning to retrain the EfficientNet B7 deep architecture. Following the transfer learning, the collected features are down-sampled using a Logistic Regression technique. Finally, the most discriminant traits are identified with the highest constant accuracy of 98.7% using state-of-the-art classifiers after 92 epochs. Based on the simulation findings, an appropriate classifier for this application is also suggested. The proposed technique’s effectiveness is confirmed by a fair comparison to existing procedures.",

Convolutional neural network, particularly deep learning is used widely in machine vision and pattern recognition task. Researchers proposed different deep learning models in the identification of diseases in plants. However, the deep learning models require a large number of parameters, and hence the required training time is more and also difficult to implement on small devices. In this paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning model based on the inception layer and residual connection. Depthwise separable convolution is used to reduce the number of parameters. The proposed model has been trained and tested on three different plant diseases datasets. The performance accuracy obtained on plantvillage dataset is 99.39%, on the rice disease dataset is 99.66%, and on the cassava dataset is 76.59%. With fewer number of parameters, the proposed model achieves higher accuracy in comparison with the state-of-art deep learning models.",

            "abstract": "Plant diseases are unfavourable factors that cause a significant decrease in the quality and quantity of crops. Experienced biologists or farmers often observe plants with the naked eye for disease, but this method is often imprecise and can take a long time. In this study, we use artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques to achieve the goal of designing and developing an intelligent classification mechanism for leaf diseases. This paper follows two methodologies and their simulation outcomes are compared for performance evaluation. In the first part, data augmentation is performed on the PlantVillage data set images (for apple, corn, potato, tomato, and rice plants), and their deep features are extracted using convolutional neural network (CNN). These features are classified by a Bayesian optimized support vector machine classifier and the results attained in terms of precision, sensitivity, f-score, and accuracy. The above-said methodologies will enable farmers all over the world to take early action to prevent their crops from becoming irreversibly damaged, thereby saving the world and themselves from a potential economic crisis. The second part of the methodology starts with the preprocessing of data set images, and their texture and color features are extracted by histogram of oriented gradient (HoG), GLCM, and color moments. Here, the three types of features, that is, color, texture, and deep features, are combined to form hybrid features. The binary particle swarm optimization is applied for the selection of these hybrid features followed by the classification with random forest classifier to get the simulation results. Binary particle swarm optimization plays a crucial role in hybrid feature selection; the purpose of this Algorithm is to obtain the suitable output with the least features. The comparative analysis of both techniques is presented with the use of the above-mentioned evaluation parameters.",

            "abstract": "Cassava is a crucial food and nutrition security crop cultivated by small-scale farmers because it can survive in a brutal environment. It is a significant source of carbohydrates in African countries. Sometimes, Cassava crops can be infected by leaf diseases, affecting the overall production and reducing farmers’ income. The existing Cassava disease research encounters several challenges, such as poor detection rate, higher processing time, and poor accuracy. This research provides a comprehensive learning strategy for real-time Cassava leaf disease identification based on enhanced CNN models (ECNN). The existing Standard CNN model utilizes extensive data processing features, increasing the computational overhead. A depth-wise separable convolution layer is utilized to resolve CNN issues in the proposed ECNN model. This feature minimizes the feature count and computational overhead. The proposed ECNN model utilizes a distinct block processing feature to process the imbalanced images. To resolve the color segregation issue, the proposed ECNN model uses a Gamma correction feature. To decrease the variable selection process and increase the computational efficiency, the proposed ECNN model uses global average election polling with batch normalization. An experimental analysis is performed over an online Cassava image dataset containing 6256 images of Cassava leaves with five disease classes. The dataset classes are as follows: class 0: “Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)”; class 1: “Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)”; class 2: “Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)”; class 3: “Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)”; and class 4: “Healthy”. Various performance measuring parameters, i.e., precision, recall, measure, and accuracy, are calculated for existing Standard CNN and the proposed ECNN model. The proposed ECNN classifier significantly outperforms and achieves 99.3% accuracy for the balanced dataset. The test findings prove that applying a balanced database of images improves classification performance.",

Therefore, we propose an architectural model with four layers, including sensor, network, service, and application, aid in deploying a smart farming system with limited energy consumption. Moreover, focusing on the application layer, we implement a deep learning approach to build a fertilizer recommendation system that matches the expert's opinion. Finally, the whole system outcomes are presented as a single mobile application for farmers’ ease of use.",

In order to extract useful features, we first prepared a 1-Dimensional Hadamard transform wavelet and a 1-Dimensional Local Binary Pattern-dependent extraction technique. Over two benchmark datasets, the University of Southern California-Human Activities Dataset, and the IM-Sporting Behaviors datasets, we employed sequential minimum optimization together with Random Forest to classify activities.

        "abstract": "With the continued penetration of smartphones among the current populace, tasks that were previously assigned to humans can now be done by our mobile devices with better efficiency. One such use case is found in the field of agriculture, from simple tasks like transferring farming news to meticulous ones like reading soil moisture, smartphones are on a clear path to becoming indispensable companions to our farmers. Contributing to nearly 20% of India's GDP (as of 2021), agriculture and its allied activities remain a relevant and powerful area of research, one such research is on the application of smartphones in the detection of crop plant diseases. One of the largest challenges faced by the agricultural industry is that of the onslaught of plant diseases and pests, It has been estimated that around 30-40% of global crop production is lost due to disease and pest attacks, so, rapid identification of crop diseases still remains a prevalent task in many parts of the world. With the advent of better and more efficient machine learning architectures, we are now ever so closer to the future of mobile crop disease diagnosis. Although, due to the limited processing powers of smartphones, especially in the budget category, image classification via more demanding, yet accurate deep learning models still seems to be impractical. In this paper, we research and propose the use of the EfficientNet family of deep learning models for the task of detecting crop plant diseases in a mobile setting, receiving an all-time high accuracy of 98.64% with significantly fewer model parameters than the other currently available deep learning models, we believe we are on a clear path towards a more practical mobile crop disease diagnosis.",

Optical techniques, such as RGB imaging, multi- and hyperspectral sensors, thermography, or chlorophyll fluorescence, have proven their potential in automated, objective, and reproducible detection systems for the identification and quantification of plant diseases at early time points in epidemics. Recently, 3D scanning has also been added as an optical analysis that supplies additional information on crop plant vitality. Different platforms from proximal to remote sensing are available for multiscale monitoring of single crop organs or entire fields. Accurate and reliable detection of diseases is facilitated by highly sophisticated and innovative methods of data analysis that lead to new insights derived from sensor data for complex plant-pathogen systems. Nondestructive, sensor-based methods support and expand upon visual and/or molecular approaches to plant disease assessment. The most relevant areas of application of sensor-based analyses are precision agriculture and plant phenotyping.",

In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. \nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

            "abstract": "A novel method for improving plant disease classification, a challenging and time-consuming process, is proposed. First, using as baseline EfficientNet, a recent and advanced family of architectures having an excellent accuracy/complexity trade-off, we have introduced, devised, and applied refined techniques based on transfer learning, regularization, stratification, weighted metrics, and advanced optimizers in order to achieve improved performance. Then, we go further by introducing adaptive minimal ensembling, which is a unique input to the knowledge base of the proposed solution. This represents a leap forward since it allows improving the accuracy with limited complexity using only two EfficientNet-b0 weak models, performing ensembling on feature vectors by a trainable layer instead of classic aggregation on outputs. To the best of our knowledge, such an approach to ensembling has never been used before in literature. Our method was tested on PlantVillage, a public reference dataset used for benchmarking models' performances for crop disease diagnostic, considering both its original and augmented versions. We noticeably improved the state of the art by achieving 100% accuracy in both the original and augmented datasets. Results were obtained using PyTorch to train, test, and validate the models; reproducibility is granted by providing exhaustive details, including hyperparameters used in the experimentation. A Web interface is also made publicly available to test the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "Tomato leaf disease poses a significant challenge as it can reduce crop yield and degrade fruit quality. To facilitate automatic and precise detection, this study leverages a deep learning approach combined with feature extraction techniques, namely Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) for texture analysis and Hue, Saturation, Value (HSV) for color representation. The dataset utilized in this research comprises 17,146 tomato leaf images affected by various diseases. The classification process employs the Inception-ResNet-V2 architecture, a convolutional neural network known for its superior performance in image classification tasks. Initially, GLCM is applied to extract texture characteristics, while HSV is used to capture detailed color information. These extracted features are subsequently fed into the Inception-ResNet-V2 model, which is trained on the processed dataset. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize model performance. Experimental results indicate that integrating GLCM and HSV features with the Inception-ResNet-V2 model yields an accuracy of 98.65%. The training process is conducted using the Adam optimizer over 10 epochs, with data split into 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing. The findings demonstrate that this approach is highly effective in accurately predicting tomato leaf diseases, making it a viable early detection system. By implementing this method, early intervention strategies can be enhanced to curb the spread of diseases in tomato plants, thereby improving agricultural productivity.",

Agriculture is the cultivation of plants for food , fiber , biofuel , medicinals and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture is the most essential and foremost economic activity of all times. Until the Industrial Revolution , the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture. Pre-industrial agriculture was typically subsistence agriculture / self-sufficiency in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own consumption instead of cash crops for trade. But now, agriculture is undergoing a structural change leading to a crisis situation. The rate of growth of agricultural output is gradually declining in the recent years due to labor scarcity and more expensive. Seed and chemical prices are rising too, creating the need for their efficient use. The recent survey shows that the world should double their agriculture productivity to feed the entire booming population by 2050. At that time with efficient management of natural resources will meet increasing demand by adopting modern technology in farming to improve agricultural productivity. Hence, as the farmers are struggle with higher seed and chemical prices, the prospect of labor shortages and growing world demand for food will drive to think an innovative and more efficient farming method. These problems in agriculture led us to propose an automated design “AGRIBOT” which can perform most of the farming activities.",

Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21:2% top-1 and 5:6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.

            "abstract": "Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) is an important member of the Solanaceae family. It is mainly used as food and cash crop globally. Tomato also serves as an ornamental plant in some parts of the world. In urban areas, this crop is included in the foodscaping systems where it is grown in hanging baskets, growing pots and aquaponics for aesthetic and food purposes. Tomato production is mainly done for fresh and processing market niches. Most developed countries process a larger portion of tomato than is offered in fresh form. Cultivation of tomato is practiced on the open field and inside greenhouses. Greenhouse production has gained popularity recently. Determinate varieties are produced outdoor while indeterminate ones are produced in greenhouses and tunnels. Due to good adaptability, heirloom tomato varieties are becoming popular especially where farmers practice tomato grafting using the indigenous varieties as rootstocks. High cost of inputs, pest and diseases, postharvest losses and marketing are the major challenges facing tomato production globally. Organic tomato production is an emerging market niche. This is due to the increased consumer awareness, environmental conservation requirements and globalization. Thus, farmers have been making strides towards compliance to organic and other sustainable standards. These standards require adoption of the requisite practices, documentation, verification and certification by a third party. Value addition in tomato is an important aspect in addressing the postharvest challenges, product diversification and ultimately profitability. This review paper is expected to provide the requisite information in tomato value chain to ensure sustainable production of tomato globally.",

            "abstract": "Heat stress is one of the production constraints for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) due to unfavorable, above optimum temperatures. This research was undertaken to evaluate growth and fruit yield of tomato genotypes under three contrasting growing conditions (i.e., optimal temperature in field-, high temperature in field- and high temperature in greenhouse conditions) to determine their relative heat tolerance. Eleven tomato genotypes, including two local check varieties, were evaluated, and data on growth and yield were measured and analyzed. The interactions between the genotypes and growing conditions for all yield traits were significant. In general, the performance of tomato under optimal temperature field conditions was better than under high temperature field- and greenhouse conditions. Genotypes CLN1621L, CLN2026D, CLN3212C, and KK1 had consistently greater fruit yield per plant in all growing conditions. Although the local genotype, Neang Tamm, had lower yield under optimal conditions, it performed moderately well under high temperature field- and high temperature greenhouse conditions, and yield decrease under high temperature condition was minimal. Genotype CLN1621L had stable fruit setting compared to other genotypes under high temperature conditions. Since fruit setting and yield are important traits for heat tolerance, genotypes CLN1621L and Neang Tamm are potential candidates for breeding programs focused on improved yield and heat stress tolerance.",

In this paper, we present a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for text-independent automatic speaker identification. The primary purpose is to identify a speaker, among many others, using a short speech segment. Most of the current researches focus on deep CNNs, which were initially designed for computer vision tasks. Besides, most of the existing speaker identification methods require audio samples longer than 3 seconds in the query phase for achieving a high accuracy. We created a CNN architecture appropriate for voice and speech-related classification tasks. We propose an optimum model that achieves 99.5% accuracy on LibriSpeech and 90% accuracy on VoxCeleb 1 dataset using only 1-second test utterances in our experiments.",

It then explains how to load and prepare the MNIST dataset, a common choice for testing image classification methods. Additionally, it introduces a custom CNN designed specifically for recognizing MNIST digits, outlining its architecture, which includes convolutional layers, activation functions, and fully connected layers for capturing handwritten numbers' details. The paper also guides starting the model, running it on sample data, reviewing outputs, and assessing the accuracy of predictions. Furthermore, it delves into training the custom CNN and evaluating its performance by comparing it with established benchmarks, utilizing loss functions and optimization techniques to fine-tune the model and assess its classification accuracy.

For accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score evaluation, many metrics are in use for comparison with the traditional machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM) and other deep learning models such as the standalone CNN and LSTM vis-à-vis the CNN-LSTM model. The CNN-LSTM model showed the highest performances across all metrics: accuracy of 0.91, precision of 0.90, recall of 0.90, and an F1 score of 0.90. Detailed error analysis has shown the problems in sarcasm detection and, to a small extent, the detection of subtly formulated sentiment, while confusion matrix analysis also shows that the neutral class has systematically been mislabeled as positive or negative. These findings point out possible areas one needs to look at for improvements by the inclusion of attention mechanisms. The results of this study emphasize the CNN-LSTM model’s practical applicability to customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, and market research. Advanced techniques and diverse datasets can be used in further research to improve the robustness of the model and its generalizability.",

However, these practices have economic and environmental implications for farmers, which must be considered. In the present study, eight technical itineraries were compared in tomato cultivation. These differed in how reduced and no-tillage practices were used to manage four soil cover types and to control weeds. The itinerary’s gross salable production (GSP), gross income (GI), and CO2 emissions were evaluated. In the second growing season, the no-tillage itinerary values of both GSP and GI were lower than those based on reduced tillage (34,681.03 and 71,891.58 EUR ha−1, respectively). The use of cover crops tendentially resulted in an increase in GSP in both growing seasons compared to cultivation on bare soil (8190.00 and 41,959.89 EUR ha−1 in 2020 and 2021, respectively), particularly with clover monoculture and a clover–rye mix in 2020 (25,326.60 and 25,818.97 EUR ha−1, respectively) and with clover monoculture in 2021 (69,310.18 EUR ha−1). A similar trend was also observed for GI. Cover crop adoption was related to a higher CO2 emissions (642.73 and 234.84 kg ha−1 in 2020 and 353.23 and 213.30 kg ha−1 in 2021, for itineraries based on reduced-tillage and no-tillage, respectively). Further studies could focus on the economic and environmental evaluation of these systems in the same pedoclimatic conditions but over the long term, quantifying the various environmental benefits of cover crops.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks can be used to diagnose and detect plant diseases, helping to avoid the plant health-related crop production losses ranging from 20 to 50% annually. However, the data collection and annotation required to achieve high accuracies can be expensive and sometimes very difficult to obtain in specific use-cases. To this end, this work proposes a synthetic data generation pipeline based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), allowing users to artificially generate images to augment their small datasets through its web interface. The image-generation pipeline is tested on a home-collected dataset of whitefly pests, Bemisia tabaci, on different crop types. The data augmentation is shown to improve the performance of lightweight object detection models when the dataset size is increased from 140 to 560 images, seeing a jump in recall at 0.50 IoU from 54.4 to 93.2%, and an increase in the average IoU from 34.6 to 70.9%, without the use of GANs. When GANs are used to increase the number of source object masks and further diversify the dataset, there is an additional 1.4 and 2.6% increase in recall and average IoU, respectively. The authenticity of the generated data is also validated by human reviewers, who reviewed the GANs generated data and scored an average of 56% in distinguishing fake from real insects for low-resolutions sets, and 67% for high-resolution sets.",

The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path toward smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.",

Climate change is expected to disproportionately affect smallholder farmers and make their livelihoods even more precarious; however, there is limited information on their overall vulnerability and adaptation needs. We conducted surveys of 600 households in Madagascar to characterize the vulnerability of smallholder farmers, identify how farmers cope with risks and explore what strategies are needed to help them adapt to climate change. Malagasy farmers are particularly vulnerable to any shocks to their agricultural system owing to their high dependence on agriculture for their livelihoods, chronic food insecurity, physical isolation and lack of access to formal safety nets. Farmers are frequently exposed to pest and disease outbreaks and extreme weather events (particularly cyclones), which cause significant crop and income losses and exacerbate food insecurity. Although farmers use a variety of risk-coping strategies, these are insufficient to prevent them from remaining food insecure. Few farmers have adjusted their farming strategies in response to climate change, owing to limited resources and capacity. Urgent technical, financial and institutional support is needed to improve the agricultural production and food security of Malagasy farmers and make their livelihoods resilient to climate change.",

        "title": "Maize-YOLO: A New High-Precision and Real-Time Method for Maize Pest Detection",
        "abstract": "Simple Summary Maize is one of the world’s most important crops, and pests can seriously damage its yield and quality. Detection of maize pests is vital to ensuring the excellent productivity of maize. Traditional methods of pest detection are generally complex and inefficient. In recent years, there have been many cases of plant pest detection through deep learning. In this paper, we propose a new real-time pest detection method based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), which not only offers higher accuracy but also faster efficiency and less computational effort. Experimental results on a maize pest dataset show that the proposed method outperforms other methods and that it can balance well between accuracy, efficiency, and computational effort. Abstract The frequent occurrence of crop pests and diseases is one of the important factors leading to the reduction of crop quality and yield. Since pests are characterized by high similarity and fast movement, this poses a challenge for artificial intelligence techniques to identify pests in a timely and accurate manner. Therefore, we propose a new high-precision and real-time method for maize pest detection, Maize-YOLO. The network is based on YOLOv7 with the insertion of the CSPResNeXt-50 module and VoVGSCSP module. It can improve network detection accuracy and detection speed while reducing the computational effort of the model. We evaluated the performance of Maize-YOLO in a typical large-scale pest dataset IP102. We trained and tested against those pest species that are more damaging to maize, including 4533 images and 13 classes. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art YOLO family of object detection algorithms and achieves suitable performance at 76.3% mAP and 77.3% recall. The method can provide accurate and real-time pest detection and identification for maize crops, enabling highly accurate end-to-end pest detection.",

However, as the basis of text classification, most existing corpus are imbalanced and often result in the classifier tending its performance to those categories with more texts. In this paper, we propose a background knowledge based multi-stream neural network to make up for the imbalance or insufficient information caused by the limitations of training corpus. The multi-stream network mainly consists of the basal stream, which retained original sequence information, and background knowledge based streams. Background knowledge is composed of keywords and co-occurred words which are extracted from external corpus. Background knowledge based streams are devoted to realizing supplemental information and reinforce basal stream. To better fuse the features extracted from different streams, early-fusion and two after-fusion strategies are employed. According to the results obtained from both Chinese corpus and English corpus, it is demonstrated that the proposed background knowledge based multi-stream neural network performs well in classification tasks.",

            "abstract": "Insect pests are one of the main factors affecting agricultural product yield. Accurate recognition of insect pests facilitates timely preventive measures to avoid economic losses. However, the existing datasets for the visual classification task mainly focus on common objects, e.g., flowers and dogs. This limits the application of powerful deep learning technology on specific domains like the agricultural field. In this paper, we collect a large-scale dataset named IP102 for insect pest recognition. Specifically, it contains more than 75, 000 images belonging to 102 categories, which exhibit a natural long-tailed distribution. In addition, we annotate about 19, 000 images with bounding boxes for object detection. The IP102 has a hierarchical taxonomy and the insect pests which mainly affect one specific agricultural product are grouped into the same upperlevel category. Furthermore, we perform several baseline experiments on the IP102 dataset, including handcrafted and deep feature based classification methods. Experimental results show that this dataset has the challenges of interand intra- class variance and data imbalance. We believe our IP102 will facilitate future research on practical insect pest control, fine-grained visual classification, and imbalanced learning fields. We make the dataset and pre-trained models publicly available at https://github.com/xpwu95/IP102.",

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.",

To construct video detection system for plant diseases and pests, and to build a real-time crop diseases and pests video detection system in the future, a deep learning-based video detection architecture with a custom backbone was proposed for detecting plant diseases and pests in videos. We first transformed the video into still frame, then sent the frame to the still-image detector for detection, and finally synthesized the frames into video. In the still-image detector, we used faster-RCNN as the framework. We used image-training models to detect relatively blurry videos. Additionally, a set of video-based evaluation metrics based on a machine learning classifier was proposed, which reflected the quality of video detection effectively in the experiments. Experiments showed that our system with the custom backbone was more suitable for detection of the untrained rice videos than VGG16, ResNet-50, ResNet-101 backbone system and YOLOv3 with our experimental environment.",

How to control the diseases and pests effectively and help the vegetable farmers to improve the yield of tomato is very important, and the most important thing is to accurately identify the diseases and insect pests. Compared with the traditional pattern recognition method, the diseases and pests recognition method based on deep learning can directly input the original image. Instead of the tedious steps such as image preprocessing, feature extraction and feature classification in the traditional method, the end-to-end structure is adopted to simplify the recognition process and solve the problem that the feature extractor designed manually is difficult to obtain the feature expression closest to the natural attribute of the object. Based on the application of deep learning object detection, not only can save time and effort, but also can achieve real-time judgment, greatly reduce the huge loss caused by diseases and pests, which has important research value and significance. Based on the latest research results of detection theory based on deep learning object detection and the characteristics of tomato diseases and pests images, this study will build the dataset of tomato diseases and pests under the real natural environment, optimize the feature layer of Yolo V3 model by using image pyramid to achieve multi-scale feature detection, improve the detection accuracy and speed of Yolo V3 model, and detect the location and category of diseases and pests of tomato accurately and quickly. Through the above research, the key technology of tomato pest image recognition in natural environment is broken through, which provides reference for intelligent recognition and engineering application of plant diseases and pests detection.",

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.",

            "abstract": "People ``understand'' the world via vision, hearing, tactile, and also the past experience. Human experience can be learned through normal learning (we call it explicit knowledge), or subconsciously (we call it implicit knowledge). These experiences learned through normal learning or subconsciously will be encoded and stored in the brain. Using these abundant experience as a huge database, human beings can effectively process data, even they were unseen beforehand. In this paper, we propose a unified network to encode implicit knowledge and explicit knowledge together, just like the human brain can learn knowledge from normal learning as well as subconsciousness learning. The unified network can generate a unified representation to simultaneously serve various tasks. We can perform kernel space alignment, prediction refinement, and multi-task learning in a convolutional neural network. The results demonstrate that when implicit knowledge is introduced into the neural network, it benefits the performance of all tasks. We further analyze the implicit representation learnt from the proposed unified network, and it shows great capability on catching the physical meaning of different tasks.

However, pay less attention to critical issues such as the similarity between the two input images, features that participate in the Image Fusion. This paper addresses these two issues by deliberately attempting a new Image Fusion framework with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN has features like pre-training and similarity score, but functionalities are limited. A CNN model with classification prediction and similarity estimation are introduced as Classification Similarity Networks (CSN) to address these issues. ResNet50 and GoogLeNet are modified as the classification branches of CSN v1, CSN v2, respectively, to reduce feature dimensions. IF rules depend on the input dataset to fusion the extracted features. The output of the fusion process is fed into CSN v3 to improve the output image quality. The proposed CSN model is pre-trained and Fully Convolutional. At the time of IF, consider the similarities between the input images. This model applies to Multi-Focus, Multi-Modal Medical, Infrared-Visual and Multi-Exposure image datasets, and analyzed outcomes. The suggested model shows a significant improvement than the modern IF algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing agricultural practices has become essential in mitigating global hunger. Over the years, significant technological advancements have been introduced to improve the quality and quantity of harvests by effectively managing weeds, pests, and diseases. Many studies have focused on identifying plant diseases, as this information aids in making informed decisions about applying fungicides and fertilizers. Advanced systems often employ a combination of image processing and deep learning techniques to identify diseases based on visible symptoms. However, these systems typically rely on pre-existing datasets or images captured in controlled environments. This study showcases the efficacy of utilizing multispectral images captured in visible and Near Infrared (NIR) ranges for identifying plant diseases in real-world environmental conditions. The collected datasets were classified using popular Vision Transformer (ViT) models, including ViT- S16, ViT-BI6, ViT-LI6 and ViT-B32. The results showed impressive training and test accuracies for all the data collected using diverse Kolari vision lenses with 93.71 % and 90.02 %, respectively. This work highlights the potential of utilizing advanced imaging techniques for accurate and reliable plant disease identification in practical field conditions.",

            "abstract": "Since hardware resources are limited, the objective of training deep learning models is typically to maximize accuracy subject to the time and memory constraints of training and inference. We study the impact of model size in this setting, focusing on Transformer models for NLP tasks that are limited by compute: self-supervised pretraining and high-resource machine translation. We first show that even though smaller Transformer models execute faster per iteration, wider and deeper models converge in significantly fewer steps. Moreover, this acceleration in convergence typically outpaces the additional computational overhead of using larger models. Therefore, the most compute-efficient training strategy is to counterintuitively train extremely large models but stop after a small number of iterations. \nThis leads to an apparent trade-off between the training efficiency of large Transformer models and the inference efficiency of small Transformer models. However, we show that large models are more robust to compression techniques such as quantization and pruning than small models. Consequently, one can get the best of both worlds: heavily compressed, large models achieve higher accuracy than lightly compressed, small models.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing is a useful tool for monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crop morphological and physiological status and supporting practices in precision farming. In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for different applications (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties’ mapping, soil characteristics, and crop classification) were also evaluated. This review is intended to assist agricultural researchers and practitioners to better understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications and promote the adoption of this valuable technology. Recommendations for future hyperspectral imaging research for precision agriculture are also presented.",

However the optimization of vision transformers has been little studied so far. In this work, we build and optimize deeper transformer networks for image classification. In particular, we investigate the interplay of architecture and optimization of such dedicated transformers. We make two architecture changes that significantly improve the accuracy of deep transformers. This leads us to produce models whose performance does not saturate early with more depth, for in-stance we obtain 86.5% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet when training with no external data, we thus attain the current sate of the art with less floating-point operations and parameters. Our best model establishes the new state of the art on Imagenet with Reassessed labels and Imagenet-V2 / match frequency, in the setting with no additional training data.

The main goal of this work is to provide visual information for the farmers to enable them to take the necessary preventive measures. A lightweight deep learning approach is proposed based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) for real-time automated plant disease classification. In addition to the ViT, the classical convolutional neural network (CNN) methods and the combination of CNN and ViT have been implemented for the plant disease classification. The models have been trained and evaluated on multiple datasets. Based on the comparison between the obtained results, it is concluded that although attention blocks increase the accuracy, they decelerate the prediction.

Improving productivity is crucial to India’s economy. Consequently, the detection of disease in greeneries plays a key role in the development sector. The accuracy and precision of diagnosing diseases in plants and animals have also been enhanced by the increased use of expertise in modern times. One solution to the problem of classifying different populations is the prospect of grouping in AI techniques. We aim to provide insight into the present state of the illnesses and how to detect them rapidly using computational reasoning. The article suggests thinking about how to use AI techniques to automatically detect plant diseases. This research paper uses the O-RPN (Optimized District Proposition Network) to isolate and control the leaves in a complicated ecosystem. The O-RPN computation incorporates the signs component using Chan-Vese (CV) techniques. The district-based CV calculation yields encouraging results for noise- and weak-edge-free image segmentation.

In this paper, a tool for early detection of banana diseases by using a deep learning approach is proposed. Five deep learning architectures, namely Vgg16, Resnet18, Resnet50, Resnet152 and InceptionV3 were used to develop models for banana disease detection, achieving all high accuracies, varying from 95.41% for InceptionV3 to 99.2% for Resnet152. InceptionV3 was selected for mobile deployment because it demands much less memory. The developed tool was capable of detecting diseases with a confidence of 99% of the captured leaves from the real environment. This tool will help smallholder farmers conduct early detection of banana diseases and improve their productivity.",

        "abstract": "Plant pests and diseases are a significant threat to almost all major types of plants and global food security. Traditional inspection across different plant fields is time-consuming and impractical for a wider plantation size, thus reducing crop production. Therefore, many smart agricultural practices are deployed to control plant diseases and pests. Most of these approaches, for example, use vision-based artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), or deep learning (DL) methods and models to provide disease detection solutions. However, existing open issues must be considered and addressed before AI methods can be used. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) and present a detailed survey of the studies employing data collection techniques and publicly available datasets. To begin the review, 1349 papers were chosen from five major academic databases, namely Springer, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ACM library. After deploying a comprehensive screening process, the review considered 176 final studies based on the importance of the method. Several crops, including grapes, rice, apples, cucumbers, maize, tomatoes, wheat, and potatoes, have tested mainly on the hyperspectral imagery and vision-centered approaches. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic regression (LR) classifiers demonstrated an increased accuracy in experiments compared to traditional classifiers. Besides the image taxonomy, disease localization is depicted in these approaches as a bottle neck to disease detection. Cognitive CNNs with attention mechanisms and transfer learning are showing an increasing trend. There is no standard model performance assessment though the majority use accuracy, recall, precision, F1 Score, and confusion matrix. The available 11 datasets are laboratory and in-field based, and 9 are publicly available. Some laboratory-based datasets are considerably small, making them impractical in experiments. Finally, there is a need to avail models with fewer parameters, implementable on small devices and large datasets accommodating several crops and diseases to have robust models.",

            "abstract": "The contribution of a plant is highly important for both human life and environment. Plants do suffer from diseases, like human beings and animals. There is the number of plant diseases that occur and affects the normal growth of a plant. These diseases affect complete plant including leaf, stem, fruit, root, and flower. Most of the time when the disease of a plant has not been taken care of, the plant dies or may cause leaves drop, flowers, and fruits drop. Appropriate diagnosis of such diseases is required for accurate identification and treatment of plant diseases. Plant pathology is the study of plant diseases, their causes, procedures for controlling and managing them. But, the existing method encompasses human involvement for classification and identification of diseases. This procedure is time-consuming and costly. Automatic segmentation of diseases from plant leaf images using soft computing approach can be reasonably useful than the existing one. In this paper, we have introduced a method named as bacterial foraging optimization based radial basis function neural network (BRBFNN) for identification and classification of plant leaf diseases automatically. For assigning optimal weight to radial basis function neural network we use bacterial foraging optimization that further increases the speed and accuracy of the network to identify and classify the regions infected of different diseases on the plant leafs. The region growing algorithm increases the efficiency of the network by searching and grouping of seed points having common attributes for feature extraction process. We worked on fungal diseases like common rust, cedar apple rust, late blight, leaf curl, leaf spot, and early blight. The proposed method attains higher accuracy in identification and classification of diseases.",

            "abstract": "Developing an automatic detector of plant diseases is one of application fields in machine learning. Ground-truth diagnoses of plant diseases which are conducted by experts in laboratory tests are often inapplicable for fast and cheap implementations. Using machine learning approaches, the images of leaves or fruits are used as input data. From the data, we design discriminative features that are good for diseases classification. However, finding suitable features from the images are often challenging due to high intra-variability and inter-variability of the data. In this paper, we present an unsupervised feature learning algorithm using the convolutional autoencoder for detection of plant diseases. The use of convolutional autoencoder has two main advantages. First, the use of handcrafted features is not necessary as the network itself may learn to produce discriminative features. Secondly, the procedure is conducted in an unsupervised manner and hence, no labeling of the data are required. Here, we use the output of the autoencoder as inputs to SVM-based classifiers for automatic detection of plant diseases. The method indicates to be better than conventional autoencoder with more hidden layers.",

            "abstract": "Early childhood is a significant period when transitions take place in children. This period is a hot topic among researchers who pursue this domain across different scientific disciplines. Many studies addressed social, scientific, medical, and technical topics during early childhood. Researchers also utilized different analysis measures to conduct experiments on the different types of data related to the early childhood to produce research articles. This paper aims to review and analyze the literature related to early childhood in addition to the data analyses and the types of data used. The factors that were considered to boost the understanding of contextual aspects in the published studies related to early childhood were considered as open challenges, motivations, and recommendations of researchers who aimed to advance the study in this area of science. We systematically searched articles on topics related to early childhood, the data analysis approaches used, and the types of data applied. The search was conducted on five major databases, namely, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed from 2013 to September 2017. These indices were considered sufficiently extensive and reliable to cover our field of the literature. Articles were selected on the basis of our inclusion and exclusion criteria ( $n=233$ ). The first portion of studies ( $n=103$ /233) focused on the different aspects related to the development of children in early age. They discussed different topics, such as the body growth development of children, psychology, skills, and other related topics that overlap between two or more of the previous topics or do not fall into any of the categories but are still under development. The second portion of studies ( $n=107$ /233) focused on different aspects associated with health in early childhood. A number of topics were discussed in this regard, such as those related to family health, medical procedures, interventions, and risk that address the health-related aspects, in addition to other related topics that overlap between two or more of the previous topics or do not fall into any of the categories but are still under health. The remaining studies ( $n=23$ /233) were categorized to the other main category because they overlap between the previous two major categories, namely, development and health, or they do not fall into any of the previous main categories. Early childhood is a sensitive period in every child’s life. This period was studied using different means of data analysis and with the aid of different data types to produce different findings from the previous studies. Research areas on early childhood vary, but they are equally significant. This paper emphasizes the current standpoint and opportunities for research in this area and boosts additional efforts toward the understanding of this research field.",

Chlorantraniliprole showed a mean emergence of approximately 79˗˗82 and 87˗˗91% at both 6.25x and 9.4x doses when host eggs (Sitotroga cerealella Olivier) were treated at larval and pupal stage of parasitoids, respectively. Helicoverpa armigera NucleoPolyhedroses Virus (HaNPV) revealed mean emergence ranging from 80 to 84% at both 12.5x and 6.25x doses in the pupal stage treatment. Spiromesifen demonstrated mean emergence approximately ranging from 82.35 to 88.55% at 5x, x, and 0.5x doses in both the egg and pupal stage treatments, and in addition at 8.3X dose in the pupal stage treatment. Spiromesifen led to mean emergence of 88.20 and 79.52% at 2x and 5x doses, respectively, when parasitoid was treated at larval stage. When individual T. chilonis females were exposed to the previously treated host eggs (S. cerealella), chlorantraniliprole resulted in mean parasitism ranging from 17.88 to 20.88 parasitized host eggs at both 5x and 3.13x doses, while spiromesifen led to mean parasitism of 7.20 parasitized host eggs at 10.4x dose and showed significant effect on parasitism by parasitoid. The results indicated that the pesticides tested against emergence exhibited no significant toxic effects on the parasitoid.",

In this paper, we proposed a new and simple structure based on the original residual block and named as feature reuse residual block which combines feature from the input signal of a residual block with the residual signal. In each feature reuse residual block, it enhances the capacity of representation by learning half and reuse half feature. By stacking the feature reuse residual block, we obtained the feature reuse residual network (FR-ResNet) and evaluated the performance on IP102 benchmark dataset. The experimental results showed that FR-ResNet can achieve significant performance improvement in terms of insect pest classification. Moreover, to demonstrate the adaptive of our approach, we applied it to various kinds of residual networks, including ResNet, Pre-ResNet, and WRN, and we tested the performance on a series of benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. The experimental results showed that the performance can be improved obviously than original networks. Based on these experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and IP102 benchmark datasets, it demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",

Accurate detection of plant disease can control the spread of disease early and prevent unnecessary loss. Strawberry verticillium wilt is a soil-borne, multi-symptomatic disease. To detect strawberry verticillium wilt accurately, we first propose a disease detection network based on Faster R-CNN and multi-task learning to detect strawberry verticillium wilt. Then, the strawberry verticillium wilt detection network (SVWDN), which uses attention mechanisms in the feature extraction of the disease detection network, is proposed. SVWDN detects verticillium wilt according to the symptoms of detected plant components (i.e.,young leaves and petioles). Compared with other existing methods for detecting disease from the whole plant appearance, the SVWDN automatically classifies the petioles and young leaves while determining whether the strawberry has verticillium wilt. To provide a dataset for evaluating and testing our method, we construct a large dataset that contains 3, 531 images with 4 categories (Healthy_leaf, Healthy_petiole, Verticillium_leaf and Verticillium_petiole). Each image also has a label to indicate whether the strawberry is suffering from verticillium wilt. With the proposed strawberry verticillium wilt detection network, we achieved a mAP of 77.54% on object detection of 4 categories and 99.95% accuracy for strawberry verticillium wilt detection.",

            "abstract": "Many applications for the automated diagnosis of plant disease have been developed based on the success of deep learning techniques. However, these applications often suffer from overfitting, and the diagnostic performance is drastically decreased when used on test data sets from new environments. In this article, we propose LeafGAN, a novel image-to-image translation system with own attention mechanism. LeafGAN generates a wide variety of diseased images via transformation from healthy images, as a data augmentation tool for improving the performance of plant disease diagnosis. Due to its own attention mechanism, our model can transform only relevant areas from images with a variety of backgrounds, thus enriching the versatility of the training images. Experiments with five-class cucumber disease classification show that data augmentation with vanilla CycleGAN cannot help to improve the generalization, i.e., disease diagnostic performance increased by only 0.7% from the baseline. In contrast, LeafGAN boosted the diagnostic performance by 7.4%. We also visually confirmed that the generated images by our LeafGAN were much better quality and more convincing than those generated by vanilla CycleGAN. The code is available publicly at https://github.com/IyatomiLab/LeafGAN. Note to Practitioners Automated plant disease diagnosis systems play an important role in the agricultural automation field. Building a practical image-based automatic plant diagnosis system requires collecting a wide variety of disease images with reliable label information. However, it is quite labor-intensive. Conventional systems have reported relatively high diagnosis performance, but most of their scores were largely biased due to the “latent similarity” between training and test images, and their true diagnosis capabilities were much lower than claimed. To address this issue, we propose LeafGAN, which generates countless diverse and high-quality training images; it works as an efficient data augmentation for the diagnosis classifier. Such generated images can be used as useful resources for improving the performance of the cucumber disease diagnosis systems.",

            "title": "Northern Maize Leaf Blight Detection Under Complex Field Environment Based on Deep Learning",
            "abstract": "Northern maize leaf blight is one of the major diseases that endanger the health of maize. The complex background of the field and different light intensity make the detection of diseases more difficult. A multi-scale feature fusion instance detection method, based on convolutional neural network, is proposed to detect maize leaf blight. The proposed technique incorporates three major steps of data set preprocessing part, fine-tuning network and detection module. In the first step, the improved retinex is used to process data sets, which successfully solves the problem of poor detection effects caused by high-intensity light. In the second step, the improved RPN is utilized to adjust the anchor box of diseased leaves. The improved RPN network identifies and deletes negative anchors, which reduces the search space of the classifier and provides better initial information for the detection network. In this paper, a transmission module is designed to connect the fine-tuning network with the detection module. On the one hand, the transmission module fuses the features of the low-level and high-level to improve the detection accuracy of small target diseases. On the other hand, the transmission module converts the feature map associated with the fine-tuning network to the detection module, thus realizing the feature sharing between the detection module and the fine-tuning network. In the third step, the detection module takes the optimized anchor as input, focuses on detecting the diseased leaves. By sharing the features of the transmission module, the time-consuming process of using candidate regions layer by layer to detect is eliminated. Therefore, the efficiency of the whole model has reached the efficiency of the one-stage model. In order to further optimize the detection effect of the model, we replace the loss function with generalized intersection over union (GIoU). After 60000 iterations, the highest mean average precision (mAP) reaches 91.83%. The experimental results indicate that the improved model outperforms several existing methods in terms of greater precision and frames per second (FPS).",

            "abstract": "The identification of maize leaf diseases will meet great challenges because of the difficulties in extracting lesion features from the constant-changing environment, uneven illumination reflection of the incident light source and many other factors. In this paper, a novel maize leaf disease recognition method is proposed. In this method, we first designed a maize leaf feature enhancement framework with the capability of enhancing the features of maize under the complex environment. Then a novel neural network is designed based on backbone Alexnet architecture, named DMS-Robust Alexnet. In the DMS-Robust Alexnet, dilated convolution and multi-scale convolution are combined to improve the capability of feature extraction. Batch normalization is performed to prevent network over-fitting while enhancing the robustness of the model. PRelu activation function and Adabound optimizer are employed to improve both convergence and accuracy. In experiments, it is validated from different perspectives that the maize leaf disease feature enhancement algorithm is conducive to improving the capability of the DMS-Robust Alexnet identification. Our method demonstrates strong robustness for maize disease images collected in the natural environment, providing a reference for the intelligent diagnosis of other plant leaf diseases.",

Key benefits and challenges of SI for plant disease detection on robotic platforms are highlighted. SI is becoming a potential tool for autonomous platforms for non-destructive plant assessment. This is because it can provide information on the plant pigments such as chlorophylls, anthocyanins and carotenoids and supports quantification of biochemical parameters such as sugars, proteins, different nutrients, water and fat content. A plant suffering from diseases will exhibit different physicochemical parameters compared with a healthy plant, allowing the SI to capture those differences as a function of reflected or absorbed light. Potential of SI to non-destructively capture physicochemical parameters in plants makes it a key technique to support disease detection on autonomous platforms. SI can be broadly used for crop disease detection by quantification of physicochemical changes in the plants.",

            "title": "Early recognition of tomato gray leaf spot disease based on MobileNetv2-YOLOv3 model",
            "abstract": "Background Tomato gray leaf spot is a worldwide disease, especially in warm and humid areas. The continuous expansion of greenhouse tomato cultivation area and the frequent introduction of foreign varieties in recent years have increased the severity of the epidemic hazards of this disease in some tomato planting bases annually. This disease is a newly developed one. Thus, farmers generally lack prevention and control experience and measures in production; the disease is often misdiagnosed or not prevented and controlled timely; this condition results in tomato production reduction or crop failure, which causes severe economic losses to farmers. Therefore, tomato gray leaf spot disease should be identified in the early stage, which will be important in avoiding or reducing the economic loss caused by the disease. The advent of the era of big data has facilitated the use of machine learning method in disease identification. Therefore, deep learning method is proposed to realise the early recognition of tomato gray leaf spot. Tomato growers need to develop the app of image detection mobile terminal of tomato gray leaf spot disease to realise real-time detection of this disease. Results This study proposes an early recognition method of tomato leaf spot based on MobileNetv2-YOLOv3 model to achieve a good balance between the accuracy and real-time detection of tomato gray leaf spot. This method improves the accuracy of the regression box of tomato gray leaf spot recognition by introducing the GIoU bounding box regression loss function. A MobileNetv2-YOLOv3 lightweight network model, which uses MobileNetv2 as the backbone network of the model, is proposed to facilitate the migration to the mobile terminal. The pre-training method combining mixup training and transfer learning is used to improve the generalisation ability of the model. The images captured under four different conditions are statistically analysed. The recognition effect of the models is evaluated by the F1 score and the AP value, and the experiment is compared with Faster-RCNN and SSD models. Experimental results show that the recognition effect of the proposed model is significantly improved. In the test dataset of images captured under the background of sufficient light without leaf shelter, the F1 score and AP value are 94.13% and 92.53%, and the average IOU value is 89.92%. In all the test sets, the F1 score and AP value are 93.24% and 91.32%, and the average IOU value is 86.98%. The object detection speed can reach 246 frames/s on GPU, the extrapolation speed for a single 416 × 416 picture is 16.9 ms, the detection speed on CPU can reach 22 frames/s, the extrapolation speed is 80.9 ms and the memory occupied by the model is 28 MB. Conclusions The proposed recognition method has the advantages of low memory consumption, high recognition accuracy and fast recognition speed. This method is a new solution for the early prediction of tomato leaf spot and a new idea for the intelligent diagnosis of tomato leaf spot.",

Although no major food shortages have emerged as yet, agricultural and food markets are facing disruptions because of labor shortages created by restrictions on movements of people and shifts in food demand resulting from closures of restaurants and schools as well as from income losses. Export restrictions imposed by some countries have disrupted trade flows for staple foods such as wheat and rice. The pandemic is affecting all four pillars of food security (1): availability (is the supply of food adequate?), access (can people obtain the food they need?), utilization (do people have enough intake of nutrients?), and stability (can people access food at all times?). COVID-19 is most directly and severely impacting access to food, even though impacts are also felt through disruptions to availability; shifts in consumer demand toward cheaper, less nutritious foods; and food price instability. We outline the main threats COVID-19 poses to food security and suggest critical responses that policy-makers should consider to prevent this global health crisis from becoming a global food crisis.",

            "abstract": "Recently, many Deep Learning models have been employed to classify different kinds of plant diseases, but very little work has been done for disease severity detection. However, it is more important to master the severities of plant diseases accurately and timely, as it helps to make effective decisions to protect the plants from being further infected and reduce financial loss. In this paper, based on the Huanglongbing (HLB)-infected leaf images obtained from PlantVillage and crowdAI, we created a dataset with 5,406 citrus leaf images infected by HLB. Then six different kinds of popular models were trained to perform the severity detection of citrus HLB with the goal to find which types of models are more suitable to detect HLB severity with the same training circumstance. The experimental results show that the Inception_v3 model with epochs=60 can achieve higher accuracy than that of other models for severity detection with an accuracy of 74.38% due to its highly computational efficiency and small number of parameters. Additionally, aiming for evaluating whether GANs-based data augmentation can contribute to improve the model learning performance, we adopted DCGANs (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) to augment the original training dataset up to two times itself. Finally, a new training dataset with 14,056 leaf images composed by the original training images and the augmented ones were used to train the Inception_v3 model. As a result, we achieved an accuracy of 92.60%, about 20% higher than that of the Inception_v3 model trained by the original training dataset, which suggested that the GANs-based data augmentation is very useful to improve the model learning performance.",

Recently, many DL architectures have been implemented accompanying visualisation techniques that are essential for determining symptoms and classifying plant diseases. This review investigates and analyses the most recent methods, developed over three years leading up to 2020, for training, augmentation, feature fusion and extraction, recognising and counting crops, and detecting plant diseases, including how these methods can be harnessed to feed deep classifiers and their effects on classifier accuracy.",

This paper introduces the innovative idea of the Internet-of-Agro-Things (IoAT) with an explanation of the automatic detection of plant disease for the development of ACPS. Majority of the crops were infected by microbial diseases in conventional agriculture. Also, the constantly mutating pathogens cannot be known to the knowledge of the farmer, due to which, there arises a demand to develop a disease prediction system. To prevent this, we use a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to perform an analysis of the crop image captured by a health maintenance system. The image capturing along with continuous sensing and intelligent automation is performed by the solar sensor node. The sensor node houses a developed soil moisture sensor which has a high longevity compared to its peers. A real time implementation of the proposed system is demonstrated using a solar sensor node with a camera module, a microcontroller and a smartphone application using which a farmer can monitor the field. The prototype was deployed for three months and has achieved a robust performance by remaining rust-free and sustaining the varied weather conditions. An accuracy of 99.24% is achieved by the proposed plant disease prediction framework.",

For tomato disease images, it is difficult to find small discriminative features between different tomato diseases, which can bring challenges to fine-grained visual categorization of tomato leaf-based images. Therefore, we propose a novel model, which consists of 3 networks, including a Location network, a Feedback network, and a Classification network, named LFC-Net. At the same time, a self-supervision mechanism is proposed in the model, which can effectively detect informative regions of tomato image without the need for manual annotation such as bounding boxes/parts. Based on the consideration of the consistency between category of the image and informativeness of the image, we design a novel training paradigm. The Location network of the model first detects informative regions in the tomato image, and optimizes iterations under the guidance of the Feedback network. Then, the Classification network uses informative regions proposed by the Location network and the full image of the tomato for classification. Our model can be regarded as a multi-network collaboration, and networks can progress together. Compared with the pre-trained model on ImageNet, our model achieves the most advanced performance in the tomato dataset, with accuracy up to 99.7%. This work demonstrates that our model has a high accuracy and has the potential to be applied to other vegetable and fruit datasets, which can provide a reference for the prevention and control of tomato diseases.",

            "abstract": "Plant disease is a major factor in yield reduction. Thus, plant breeders currently rely on selecting disease-resistant plant cultivars, which involves disease severity rating of a large variety of cultivars. Traditional visual screening of these cultivars is an error-prone process, which necessitates the development of an automatic framework for disease quantification based on field-acquired images using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to augment the throughput. Since these images are impaired by complex backgrounds, uneven lighting, and densely overlapping leaves, state-of-the-art frameworks formulate the processing pipeline as a dichotomy problem (i.e. presence/absence of disease). However, additional information regarding accurate disease localization and quantification is crucial for breeders. This paper proposes a deep framework for simultaneous segmentation of individual leaf instances and corresponding diseased region using a unified feature map with a multi-task loss function for an end-to-end training. We test the framework on field maize dataset with Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) disease and the experimental results show a disease severity correlation of 73% with the manual ground truth data and run-time efficiency of 5fps.",

            "abstract": "Plant disease diagnosis is very critical for agriculture due to its importance for increasing crop production. Recent advances in image processing offer us a new way to solve this issue via visual plant disease analysis. However, there are few works in this area, not to mention systematic researches. In this paper, we systematically investigate the problem of visual plant disease recognition for plant disease diagnosis. Compared with other types of images, plant disease images generally exhibit randomly distributed lesions, diverse symptoms and complex backgrounds, and thus are hard to capture discriminative information. To facilitate the plant disease recognition research, we construct a new large-scale plant disease dataset with 271 plant disease categories and 220,592 images. Based on this dataset, we tackle plant disease recognition via reweighting both visual regions and loss to emphasize diseased parts. We first compute the weights of all the divided patches from each image based on the cluster distribution of these patches to indicate the discriminative level of each patch. Then we allocate the weight to each loss for each patch-label pair during weakly-supervised training to enable discriminative disease part learning. We finally extract patch features from the network trained with loss reweighting, and utilize the LSTM network to encode the weighed patch feature sequence into a comprehensive feature representation. Extensive evaluations on this dataset and another public dataset demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method. We expect this research will further the agenda of plant disease recognition in the community of image processing.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) have been characterized by complex implementation and coordination gaps, related to uneven framings in domestic contexts. This study analyzes these framing processes in Brazil and Colombia by examining the translation of global prescriptions into tangible policy instruments. It combines a policy translation analytical framework with the processes of layering, drift, conversion, and replacement. It draws on semi-structured interviews with institutional actors and it examines (i) agenda-setting and elaboration of the NAPs, (ii) the different roles and interactions of sector-based actors in agriculture and land-use, and (iii) the distinct concepts of adaptation put forward and their subsequent policy outputs in relation to national institutional trajectories. In Brazil and Colombia, the initial ambition of mainstreaming climate adaptation into sector-based policies resulted in a divergent patchwork of policies, which is characterized by limited means, capacity and other resources dedicated to coordination and implementation. Key policy insights The study examines the processes through which international prescriptions influence concrete policy outcomes. The ambition of establishing new climate policies resulted in a patchwork of policies, characterized by low levels of coordination and limited means of implementation. In Brazil, adaptation goals were layered in with existing sector-based policies with some operational capacity, while in Colombia the national adoption of several adaptation goals has not translated into implementation. The article addresses the politics of policy transfer, knowledge interpretation, and policy change. It considers the possibility of actors interacting to reframe concepts according to their ideas and interests, while also aiming to assure stability. Climate policy requires efforts to alter policy priorities at the sector level, to create cross-sectoral balances, and strengthen the means of implementation, actions which intimately relate to power relations and institutional settings.",

        "abstract": "The coconut plant plays a significant role in the Sri Lankan domestic and export industries. It is a major livelihood crop of which more than 65% is consumed locally. However, most coconut trees suffer from various pest and disease outbreaks, which have an impact on the economy of coconut production. Out of them, infestations of Whiteflies, Plesispa Beetle, and Red Palm Weevil are destructive to the coconut plant at different stages, so early detection of those infections is a major task. To this end, the paper describes an IoT-based prediction system for detecting and classifying infections in the coconut industry.; Internet of Things (IoT), image processing, audio processing, and deep learning were used as techniques to utilize for the detection of those infestations. Audio and Image-capturing devices are developed to collect audio and image data. Additionally, there’s a knowledge dissemination system to identify the main coconut pests in Sri Lanka and share this knowledge with farmers. With the audio and image datasets gathered from the mentioned diseases, performance evaluation of the Deep Learning (DL) models revealed that the accuracy of the identifications of Red Palm Weevil infestation Plesispa beetle and Whitefly infestations is 88, 96, and 98% respectively.",

        "abstract": "Plant diseases cause large output decreases and financial losses, making them a major barrier to global food security, especially in developing nations like Nepal, where corn is a staple crop. Early and accurate detection is critical to mitigating these impacts and improving crop management. Traditional diagnostic methods, reliant on manual inspection, are often time-consuming, subjective, and impractical for large-scale agricultural applications. This paper explores the automatic categorization of corn leaf diseases using deep learning-driven Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically DenseNet 201 and Xception architectures. Convolutional layers in these models learn and extract distinctive features automatically from images, enabling accurate and efficient classification of corn disease types. A freely accessible dataset comprising images of both healthy and diseased corn leaves was utilized, with data augmentation strategies used to enhance model generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DenseNet201 achieved a test accuracy of 98.69%, outperforming Xception, which attained 96.61%. These results demonstrate the highlights of CNN-based approaches for scalable, non-invasive, and accurate disease detection in corn crops. The proposed method offers a viable tool to support precision agriculture and contribute to enhancing global food security.",

In this light, a depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and significantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classification dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efficient use of model parameters.",

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections&#x2014;one between each layer and its subsequent layer&#x2014;our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance.

The person driving a car needs to be alert, especially when travelling through high traffic volumes that permit high-speed transit since a slight distraction can cause a fatal accident. Even though semiautomated checks, such as speed detecting cameras and speed barriers, are deployed, controlling human errors is an arduous task. The key causes of driver’s distraction include drunken driving, conversing with co-passengers, fatigue, and operating gadgets while driving. If these distractions are accurately predicted, the drivers can be alerted through an alarm system. Further, this research develops a deep convolutional neural network (deep CNN) models for predicting the reason behind the driver’s distraction. The deep CNN models are trained using numerous images of distracted drivers. The performance of deepCNNmodels, namely theVGG16,ResNet, andXception network, is assessed based on the evaluation metrics, such as the precision score, the recall/sensitivity score, the F1 score, and the specificity score. The ResNet model outperformed all other models as the best detection model for predicting and accurately determining the drivers’ activities.",

            "title": "A Robust Deep-Learning-Based Detector for Real-Time Tomato Plant Diseases and Pests Recognition",
            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of deep neural networks has allowed the development of fully automated and efficient diagnostic systems for plant disease and pest phenotyping. Although previous approaches have proven to be promising, they are limited, especially in real-life scenarios, to properly diagnose and characterize the problem. In this work, we propose a framework which besides recognizing and localizing various plant abnormalities also informs the user about the severity of the diseases infecting the plant. By taking a single image as input, our algorithm is able to generate detailed descriptive phrases (user-defined) that display the location, severity stage, and visual attributes of all the abnormalities that are present in the image. Our framework is composed of three main components. One of them is a detector that accurately and efficiently recognizes and localizes the abnormalities in plants by extracting region-based anomaly features using a deep neural network-based feature extractor. The second one is an encoder–decoder network that performs pixel-level analysis to generate abnormality-specific severity levels. Lastly is an integration unit which aggregates the information of these units and assigns unique IDs to all the detected anomaly instances, thus generating descriptive sentences describing the location, severity, and class of anomalies infecting plants. We discuss two possible ways of utilizing the abovementioned units in a single framework. We evaluate and analyze the efficacy of both approaches on newly constructed diverse paprika disease and pest recognition datasets, comprising six anomaly categories along with 11 different severity levels. Our algorithm achieves mean average precision of 91.7% for the abnormality detection task and a mean panoptic quality score of 70.78% for severity level prediction. Our algorithm provides a practical and cost-efficient solution to farmers that facilitates proper handling of crops.",

It's a little bigger than last time but more accurate. It's still fast though, don't worry. At 320x320 YOLOv3 runs in 22 ms at 28.2 mAP, as accurate as SSD but three times faster. When we look at the old .5 IOU mAP detection metric YOLOv3 is quite good. It achieves 57.9 mAP@50 in 51 ms on a Titan X, compared to 57.5 mAP@50 in 198 ms by RetinaNet, similar performance but 3.8x faster. As always, all the code is online at this https URL",

            "abstract": "Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections&#x2014;one between each layer and its subsequent layer&#x2014;our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance.

But pyramid representations have been avoided in recent object detectors that are based on deep convolutional networks, partially because they are slow to compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.",

            "abstract": "Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

            "abstract": "Tremendous progress has been made in object recognition with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), thanks to the availability of large-scale annotated dataset. With the ability of learning highly hierarchical image feature extractors, deep CNNs are also expected to solve the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) target classification problems. However, the limited labeled SAR target data becomes a handicap to train a deep CNN. To solve this problem, we propose a transfer learning based method, making knowledge learned from sufficient unlabeled SAR scene images transferrable to labeled SAR target data. We design an assembled CNN architecture consisting of a classification pathway and a reconstruction pathway, together with a feedback bypass additionally. Instead of training a deep network with limited dataset from scratch, a large number of unlabeled SAR scene images are used to train the reconstruction pathway with stacked convolutional auto-encoders (SCAE) at first. Then, these pre-trained convolutional layers are reused to transfer knowledge to SAR target classification tasks, with feedback bypass introducing the reconstruction loss simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that transfer learning leads to a better performance in the case of scarce labeled training data and the additional feedback bypass with reconstruction loss helps to boost the capability of classification pathway.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental problem that confronts deep neural networks is the requirement of a large amount of data for a system to be efficient in complex applications. Promising results of this problem are made possible through the use of techniques such as data augmentation or transfer learning of pre-trained models in large datasets. But the problem still persists when the application provides limited or unbalanced data. In addition, the number of false positives resulting from training a deep model significantly cause a negative impact on the performance of the system. This study aims to address the problem of false positives and class unbalance by implementing a Refinement Filter Bank framework for Tomato Plant Diseases and Pests Recognition. The system consists of three main units: First, a Primary Diagnosis Unit (Bounding Box Generator) generates the bounding boxes that contain the location of the infected area and class. The promising boxes belonging to each class are then used as input to a Secondary Diagnosis Unit (CNN Filter Bank) for verification. In this second unit, misclassified samples are filtered through the training of independent CNN classifiers for each class. The result of the CNN Filter Bank is a decision of whether a target belongs to the category as it was detected (True) or not (False) otherwise. Finally, an integration unit combines the information from the primary and secondary units while keeping the True Positive samples and eliminating the False Positives that were misclassified in the first unit. By this implementation, the proposed approach is able to obtain a recognition rate of approximately 96%, which represents an improvement of 13% compared to our previous work in the complex task of tomato diseases and pest recognition. Furthermore, our system is able to deal with the false positives generated by the bounding box generator, and class unbalances that appear especially on datasets with limited data.",

The user touches the application's display screen to select up to eight different colors that represent healthy tissues. The user then moves a threshold slider until only the symptomatic tissues have been transformed into a blue hue. The pixelated image is then analyzed to calculate the disease percentage. This study reports the accuracy, precision, and robustness of Leaf Doctor using six different diseases with typical lesions of varying severity. Estimates of disease severity from Leaf Doctor were highly accurate (R2 ≥ 0.79; Cb ≥ 0.959) compared with estimates obtained from the discipline-standard, Assess. Precision was operationally defined as the ability of a rater to use Leaf Doctor and repeatedly obtain similar percentages of disease severity for the same image. Coefficients of variation were low (0.51 to 14.1%) across all disease datasets but a significant negative relationship was found between the coefficient of variation of estimates and mean disease severity. Other advantages of Leaf Doctor included comparatively less time for image processing, low cost, ease of use, ability to send results by e-mail, and the ability to create realistic standard area diagrams. Leaf Doctor is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch and is optimized for iPhone 5. It is available as a free download at the iTunes Store.",

In order to boost the representational power of a network, several recent approaches have shown the benefit of enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the \"Squeeze-and-Excitation\" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We demonstrate that by stacking these blocks together, we can construct SENet architectures that generalise extremely well across challenging datasets. Crucially, we find that SE blocks produce significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures at minimal additional computational cost. SENets formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and significantly reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, achieving a ~25% relative improvement over the winning entry of 2016.

I argued last lecture that such a scale space will give local maxima and local minima over (x, y, σ) when there is a box-like intensity pattern present (sometimes called a \" blob \"). The box either can be brighter than its background (this gives a local minimum) or darker than its local background (this gives a local maximum). The maxima and minima occur at specific scales which are related to the size of the box. As we saw with the examples in the slides from last lecture, local maxima and minima arise from other image intensity patterns – not just 2D boxs (squares). It is common to refer to such local maxima and minima of the filtered image as keypoints. These are similar to Harris corner points, but now we are specifically defining them to be local maxes and mins of the filtered image in a 3D scale space. Keypoints have a position and a scale. Note: With Harris corners, we examined maxima of the Harris measure in 2D for a particular scale σ. For Harris corners, we did not argue that the maxima over scale should be characteristic of the \" size \" of the image pattern in any sense. Neither a corner nor a step edge has a natural scale. By contrast shapes like bars, boxes, disks, etc do have a naturarl scale, namely the width (or half-width). For each keypoint, we have a position (x, y) and a scale σ. It is common to define a descriptor of the image in the neighborhood of each keypoint. Each keypoint has a scale σ so we use the intensity structure in the scale space at that scale σ and in a local neighborhood of the keypoint position, where the definition of \" local \" depends on σ. How can we describe the local intensity structure ? Let's sketch out one method, called SIFT, which was invented about 10 years ago by Dave Lowe and his students at UBC and which has been very popular. Assume we have found a keypoint at (x 0 , y 0 , σ 0) which is a local maximum (or minimum) in the ∇ 2 g σ (x, y) * I(x, y). We ensure that this …",

            "abstract": "Tomato is affected by various diseases and pests during its growth process. If the control is not timely, it will lead to yield reduction or even crop failure. How to control the diseases and pests effectively and help the vegetable farmers to improve the yield of tomato is very important, and the most important thing is to accurately identify the diseases and insect pests. Compared with the traditional pattern recognition method, the diseases and pests recognition method based on deep learning can directly input the original image. Instead of the tedious steps such as image preprocessing, feature extraction and feature classification in the traditional method, the end-to-end structure is adopted to simplify the recognition process and solve the problem that the feature extractor designed manually is difficult to obtain the feature expression closest to the natural attribute of the object. Based on the application of deep learning object detection, not only can save time and effort, but also can achieve real-time judgment, greatly reduce the huge loss caused by diseases and pests, which has important research value and significance. Based on the latest research results of detection theory based on deep learning object detection and the characteristics of tomato diseases and pests images, this study will build the dataset of tomato diseases and pests under the real natural environment, optimize the feature layer of Yolo V3 model by using image pyramid to achieve multi-scale feature detection, improve the detection accuracy and speed of Yolo V3 model, and detect the location and category of diseases and pests of tomato accurately and quickly. Through the above research, the key technology of tomato pest image recognition in natural environment is broken through, which provides reference for intelligent recognition and engineering application of plant diseases and pests detection.",

            "abstract": "Autonomous harvesters can be used for the timely cultivation of high-value crops such as strawberries, where the robots have the capability to identify ripe and unripe crops. However, the real-time segmentation of strawberries in an unbridled farming environment is a challenging task due to fruit occlusion by multiple trusses, stems, and leaves. In this work, we propose a possible solution by constructing a dynamic feature selection mechanism for convolutional neural networks (CNN). The proposed building block namely a dense attention module (DAM) controls the flow of information between the convolutional encoder and decoder. DAM enables hierarchical adaptive feature fusion by exploiting both inter-channel and intra-channel relationships and can be easily integrated into any existing CNN to obtain category-specific feature maps. We validate our attention module through extensive ablation experiments. In addition, a dataset is collected from different strawberry farms and divided into four classes corresponding to different maturity levels of fruits and one is devoted to background. Quantitative analysis of the proposed method showed a 4.1% and 2.32% increase in mean intersection over union, over existing state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models and other attention modules respectively, while simultaneously retaining a processing speed of 53 frames per second.",

Convolutional Neural Networks, one of the deep learning tools, have attained an impressive outcome in this area. Applications such as identifying objects, faces, bones, handwritten digits, and traffic signs signify the importance of Convolutional Neural Networks in the real world. The effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks in image recognition motivates the researchers to extend its applications in the field of agriculture for recognition of plant species, yield management, weed detection, soil, and water management, fruit counting, diseases, and pest detection, evaluating the nutrient status of plants, and much more. The availability of voluminous research works in applying deep learning models in agriculture leads to difficulty in selecting a suitable model according to the type of dataset and experimental environment. In this manuscript, the authors present a survey of the existing literature in applying deep Convolutional Neural Networks to predict plant diseases from leaf images. This manuscript presents an exemplary comparison of the pre-processing techniques, Convolutional Neural Network models, frameworks, and optimization techniques applied to detect and classify plant diseases using leaf images as a data set. This manuscript also presents a survey of the datasets and performance metrics used to evaluate the efficacy of models. The manuscript highlights the advantages and disadvantages of different techniques and models proposed in the existing literature. This survey will ease the task of researchers working in the field of applying deep learning techniques for the identification and classification of plant leaf diseases.",

To detect plant disease at early stages, selecting appropriate techniques is imperative as it affects the cost, diagnosis time, and accuracy. This research gives a comprehensive review of various plant disease detection methods based on the images used and processing algorithms applied. It systematically analyzes various traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms used for processing visible and spectral range images, and comparatively evaluates the work done in literature in terms of datasets used, various image processing techniques employed, models utilized, and efficiency achieved. The study discusses the benefits and restrictions of each method along with the challenges to be addressed for rapid and accurate plant disease detection. Results show that for plant disease detection, deep learning outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms while visible range images are more widely used compared to spectral images.",

Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

Experiments on ImageNet classification and MS COCO object detection demonstrate the superior performance of ShuffleNet over other structures, e.g. lower top-1 error (absolute 7.8%) than recent MobileNet [12] on ImageNet classification task, under the computation budget of 40 MFLOPs.

This is fundamental in the driving sector of Remote Sensing where hyperspectral technology was born and has mostly developed, but it is perhaps even more true in the multitude of current and evolving application sectors that involve these imaging technologies. The present review develops on two fronts: on the one hand, it is aimed at domain professionals who want to have an updated overview on how hyperspectral acquisition techniques can combine with deep learning architectures to solve specific tasks in different application fields. On the other hand, we want to target the machine learning and computer vision experts by giving them a picture of how deep learning technologies are applied to hyperspectral data from a multidisciplinary perspective. The presence of these two viewpoints and the inclusion of application fields other than Remote Sensing are the original contributions of this review, which also highlights some potentialities and critical issues related to the observed development trends.",

            "abstract": "Yellow rust in winter wheat is a widespread and serious fungal disease, resulting in significant yield losses globally. Effective monitoring and accurate detection of yellow rust are crucial to ensure stable and reliable wheat production and food security. The existing standard methods often rely on manual inspection of disease symptoms in a small crop area by agronomists or trained surveyors. This is costly, time consuming and prone to error due to the subjectivity of surveyors. Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mounted with hyperspectral image sensors have the potential to address these issues with low cost and high efficiency. This work proposed a new deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based approach for automated crop disease detection using very high spatial resolution hyperspectral images captured with UAVs. The proposed model introduced multiple Inception-Resnet layers for feature extraction and was optimized to establish the most suitable depth and width of the network. Benefiting from the ability of convolution layers to handle three-dimensional data, the model used both spatial and spectral information for yellow rust detection. The model was calibrated with hyperspectral imagery collected by UAVs in five different dates across a whole crop cycle over a well-controlled field experiment with healthy and rust infected wheat plots. Its performance was compared across sampling dates and with random forest, a representative of traditional classification methods in which only spectral information was used. It was found that the method has high performance across all the growing cycle, particularly at late stages of the disease spread. The overall accuracy of the proposed model (0.85) was higher than that of the random forest classifier (0.77). These results showed that combining both spectral and spatial information is a suitable approach to improving the accuracy of crop disease detection with high resolution UAV hyperspectral images.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundBanana (Musa spp.) is the most popular marketable fruit crop grown all over the world, and a dominant staple food in many developing countries. Worldwide, banana production is affected by numerous diseases and pests. Novel and rapid methods for the timely detection of pests and diseases will allow to surveil and develop control measures with greater efficiency. As deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and transfer learning has been successfully applied in various fields, it has freshly moved in the domain of just-in-time crop disease detection. The aim of this research is to develop an AI-based banana disease and pest detection system using a DCNN to support banana farmers.ResultsLarge datasets of expert pre-screened banana disease and pest symptom/damage images were collected from various hotspots in Africa and Southern India. To build a detection model, we retrained three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using a transfer learning approach. A total of six different models were developed from 18 different classes (disease by plant parts) using images collected from different parts of the banana plant. Our studies revealed ResNet50 and InceptionV2 based models performed better compared to MobileNetV1. These architectures represent the state-of-the-art results of banana diseases and pest detection with an accuracy of more than 90% in most of the models tested. These experimental results were comparable with other state-of-the-art models found in the literature. With a future view to run these detection capabilities on a mobile device, we evaluated the performance of SSD (single shot detector) MobileNetV1. Performance and validation metrics were also computed to measure the accuracy of different models in automated disease detection methods.ConclusionOur results showed that the DCNN was a robust and easily deployable strategy for digital banana disease and pest detection. Using a pre-trained disease recognition model, we were able to perform deep transfer learning (DTL) to produce a network that can make accurate predictions. This significant high success rate makes the model a useful early disease and pest detection tool, and this research could be further extended to develop a fully automated mobile app to help millions of banana farmers in developing countries.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging is emerging as a promising approach for plant disease identification. The large and possibly redundant information contained in hyperspectral data cubes makes deep learning based identification of plant diseases a natural fit. Here, we deploy a novel 3D deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) that directly assimilates the hyperspectral data. Furthermore, we interrogate the learnt model to produce physiologically meaningful explanations. We focus on an economically important disease, charcoal rot, which is a soil borne fungal disease that affects the yield of soybean crops worldwide. Based on hyperspectral imaging of inoculated and mock-inoculated stem images, our 3D DCNN has a classification accuracy of 95.73% and an infected class F1 score of 0.87. Using the concept of a saliency map, we visualize the most sensitive pixel locations, and show that the spatial regions with visible disease symptoms are overwhelmingly chosen by the model for classification. We also find that the most sensitive wavelengths used by the model for classification are in the near infrared region (NIR), which is also the commonly used spectral range for determining the vegetative health of a plant. The use of an explainable deep learning model not only provides high accuracy, but also provides physiological insight into model predictions, thus generating confidence in model predictions. These explained predictions lend themselves for eventual use in precision agriculture and research application using automated phenotyping platforms.",

The experimental results give an enhanced performance with a classification accuracy of 99.93% for the whole leaf images and 99.74% for the images with individual lesions.

Since humans cannot provide a fully reliable inspection compared to a machine, an intelligent system can complement the human inspection process in many industrial applications. Therefore, this paper provides a real industrial case-study for applications of deep learning and computer vision in increasing the quality of inspection by providing a monitoring system for managers to detect inspection flaws in the automotive industry. To achieve this, an enhanced deep neural network approach is proposed to detect different classes of objects in each frame of an inspection video stream. The sequence of the detected classes is then compared to the manufacturer’s inspection process to identify potential flaws in inspection process compliance. A comprehensive comparison of the proposed approach’s performance to other object detection methods for training speed and detection accuracy proves its superiority Compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.",

In agriculture, the search for automatic detection of leaf characteristics is essential for monitoring large fields and automatically detects the symptoms of the leaves as soon as they appear on the leaves of the plants. The proposed decision-making system uses the characterization of the content of the image and a network of supervised classification neurons. Image processing techniques for this type of decision analysis include pretreatment, feature extraction and classification steps. During processing, the size of an input image will be resized and the region of interest will be selected. Here, the characteristics of color and texture are extracted from an input for the formation and classification of the network. Color characteristics as an average, standard deviation of the HSV color space and texture characteristics such as energy, contrast, homogeneity and correlation. The system will be used to automatically classify the test images to determine the characteristics of the leaf. For this approach, the automatic Neural Network classifier can be used for classification based on learning with examples of learning in this category. This network uses the sigmoid tangent function as a function of the kernel. Finally, the simulated result shows that the network classifier used provides a minimum error during training and better classification accuracy .",

            "abstract": "The detection of plant disease is of vital importance in practical agricultural production. It scrutinizes the plant's growth and health condition and guarantees the regular operation and harvest of the agricultural planting to proceed successfully. In recent decades, the maturation of computer vision technology has provided more possibilities for implementing plant disease detection. Nonetheless, detecting plant diseases is typically hindered by factors such as variations in the illuminance and weather when capturing images and the number of leaves or organs containing diseases in one image. Meanwhile, traditional deep learning-based algorithms attain multiple deficiencies in the area of this research: (1) Training models necessitate a significant investment in hardware and a large amount of data. (2) Due to their slow inference speed, models are tough to acclimate to practical production. (3) Models are unable to generalize well enough. Provided these impediments, this study suggested a Tranvolution detection network with GAN modules for plant disease detection. Foremost, a generative model was added ahead of the backbone, and GAN models were added to the attention extraction module to construct GAN modules. Afterward, the Transformer was modified and incorporated with the CNN, and then we suggested the Tranvolution architecture. Eventually, we validated the performance of different generative models' combinations. Experimental outcomes demonstrated that the proposed method satisfyingly achieved 51.7% (Precision), 48.1% (Recall), and 50.3% (mAP), respectively. Furthermore, the SAGAN model was the best in the attention extraction module, while WGAN performed best in image augmentation. Additionally, we deployed the proposed model on Hbird E203 and devised an intelligent agricultural robot to put the model into practical agricultural use.",

Moreover, India, in the fiscal year 2021, produced over 50 million metric tons of potatoes out of which _ percent was wasted due to late blight and early blight diseases. The traditional methods to detect diseases in the plants involve manual inspection. This method is very expensive, time-consuming and does not provide satisfactory results. So as to identify the infected leaves at the beginning of their growth cycle which will help to increase the yield and thereby decrease the losses incurred by the farmers, we propose a web application to do the same with the help of deep learning models like InceptionNet, ResNet50, MobileNet and CNN trained on the PlantVillage dataset available on kaggle.

Diseases can diminish total yields and farmers' income if they are not identified early enough. Reducing plant diseases and enhancing the quality and yield of food crops can both benefit from early and accurate analysis and identification of plant diseases. Since there aren't any potato disease experts in remote places, an automated, affordable, usable, and trustworthy method is needed to diagnose plant diseases without the use of laboratory testing or expert judgement. To overcome this problem, many researchers have presented approaches based on deep learning and machine learning. However, most of these systems either use millions of training parameters or have poor classification accuracy. In this paper, we provide a model for automatic plant disease identification based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). To categories potato leaves into his three classes-healthy leaves, early blight and late blight. CNN devised a methodology. This work makes use of 5162 original image dataset and 82,592 augmented images. CNN models have a classification accuracy of 98.07% and can automatically learn features from raw photos. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and other deep learning techniques can be used to detect plant illnesses.",

However, many diseases that affect crop quality and yield can interfere with tea production. Machine learning techniques such as deep learning are making it easier to identify and classify these diseases in tea leaves. The presence of disease symptoms in tea leaves can be used to classify and identify various diseases using deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This strategy helps detect disease early and maintain good health. Both of these are essential to sustainable agricultural practices. As manual detection can be time-consuming and require specialized personnel, applying image processing models can greatly aid in identifying diseases in a large number of tea leaves.

        "abstract": "The soybean, which is a fundamental component of worldwide agriculture, plays a crucial role in meeting the global need for protein and oil. Nevertheless, the spread of many diseases poses a significant risk to both the quantity and quality of soybean harvests. The timely and accurate categorization of diseases is crucial for the successful implementation of crop management strategies. This study aims to enhance the categorization of soybean diseases by addressing ten different disease classes using the ResNet50V2 deep learning model. In order to accomplish this objective, the Soybean Disease Leaf Image Classification Dataset has been employed for both the purposes of training as well as evaluating the model. The ResNet50V2 model's architectural depth and inclusion of skip connections augment its capacity to grasp complicated patterns present in leaf images, hence bolstering its efficacy in performing robust categorization. The experimental findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of our methodology since the model attains a notable training accuracy of 97% and validation accuracy rate of 96% when diagnosing illnesses in soybean plant leaves with a minimum loss of 0.05 and 0.38. Moreover, this research endeavor makes a valuable contribution to the expanding domain of computer vision in the agricultural sector, facilitating the automation and enhancement of plant disease diagnosis processes.",

HAM10000 image dataset has been deployed for conducting the task of categorizing the skin lesions for seven classes; MNV, MLN, BKT, DFM, BCC, ACTK, and VSL. The quantity of photos has also increased by applying various techniques such as image augmentation. The model has shown satisfactory results and the final accuracy achieved was 90.34% and the validation accuracy of 90.87%. The loss was nominal and the model is capable of classifying the skin lesions in the correct category. This model can be used in the medical area along with the research area for the classification of other skin issues.",

        "title": "mPD-APP: a mobile-enabled plant diseases diagnosis application using convolutional neural network toward the attainment of a food secure world",
        "abstract": "The devastating effect of plant disease infestation on crop production poses a significant threat to the attainment of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) of food security, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This has been further exacerbated by the lack of effective and accessible plant disease detection technologies. Farmers' inability to quickly and accurately diagnose plant diseases leads to crop destruction and reduced productivity. The diverse range of existing plant diseases further complicates detection for farmers without the right technologies, hindering efforts to combat food insecurity in the region. This study presents a web-based plant diagnosis application, referred to as mobile-enabled Plant Diagnosis-Application (mPD-App). First, a publicly available image dataset, containing a diverse range of plant diseases, was acquired from Kaggle for the purpose of training the detection system. The image dataset was, then, made to undergo the preprocessing stage which included processes such as image-to-array conversion, image reshaping, and data augmentation. The training phase leverages the vast computational ability of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to effectively classify image datasets. The CNN model architecture featured six convolutional layers (including the fully connected layer) with phases, such as normalization layer, rectified linear unit (RELU), max pooling layer, and dropout layer. The training process was carefully managed to prevent underfitting and overfitting of the model, ensuring accurate predictions. The mPD-App demonstrated excellent performance in diagnosing plant diseases, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.91%. The model was able to classify 14 different types of plant diseases with high precision and recall values. The ROC curve showed a promising area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.946, indicating the model's reliability in detecting diseases. The web-based mPD-App offers a valuable tool for farmers and agricultural stakeholders in Sub-Saharan Africa, to detect and diagnose plant diseases effectively and efficiently. To further improve the application's performance, ongoing efforts should focus on expanding the dataset and refining the model's architecture. Agricultural authorities and policymakers should consider promoting and integrating such technologies into existing agricultural extension services to maximize their impact and benefit the farming community.",

            "abstract": "Fruits significantly impact everyday living, i.e., Citrus fruits. Numerous fruits have a solid nutritious value and are packed with multivitamins and trace components. Citrus fruits are delicate and susceptible to many diseases and infections. Many researchers have suggested deep and machine learning-based fruit disease detection and classification models. This research presents a precise fruit disease identification model based on context data fusion with Faster-CNN in an edge computing environment. The goal is to develop an accurate, efficient, and trustable fruit disease detection model, a critical component of autonomous food production in a robotic edge platform. This research examines and explores four different diseases of Citrus fruits using CNN deep learning models to be adopted as edge computing solutions. Identification of citrus diseases such as cankers black spot, greening, scab, melanosis, and healthy citrus fruits are implemented using the proposed sequential model without pruning, with pruning having different sparsity levels followed by post quantization. Through the transfer learning method, this model is optimized for the assignment of fruit disease detection employing visuals from two patterns: Near-infrared (NIFR) and RGB. Early and late data fusion techniques for integrating multi-model (NIFR and RGB) facts are evaluated. The accuracy obtained from the proposed model for the canker disease is 97%, scab 95%, melanosis 99%, Greening 97%, Black spot 97% and healthy 97%. In this paper, the results of the proposed model are compared and evaluated with the sparsity levels of 50–80%, 60–90%, 70–90%, and 80–90% pruning and also obtained the results of post-quantization on each level. The results show that the model size with 60–90% pruning can be counteracted to the 47.64 of the baseline model without significant loss of accuracy. Moreover, post-quantization can reduce the 60–90% pruning from 28.16 to 8.72. In addition to enhanced precision, the above initiative is much faster to implement for new fruit diseases because it needs bounding box annotation instead of pixel-level annotation.",

        "abstract": "The threat of plant disease is a significant problem affecting the world, when untreated these diseases can affect food production. Diagnosis of these diseases in an un-delayed manner is very important, however, methods described in current use that only involve the use of sight are inefficient and are also subject to errors. This paper tackles the problem by using Cycle-Consistent General Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) to create artificial images of diseased plant leaves. The advantage of this approach is that augmenting the training data with images that do not exist in the real world helps improve the performance of disease classifications. The research takes into consideration the apple leaves diseased images, is of various pathogens, and CycleGAN creates images to even it. The results indicate that CycleGAN is indeed able to generate artificial images for the less complicated sicknesses associated with a mere shift in color, with an achieved micro-average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of .98 and macro-average AUC of 0.94. On the contrary, this model has problems in striking a balance while dealing with more complex diseases that have problems that are underlying structural deformation. However, adding such images in training datasets increases the classification accuracy in total. Future work should involve making the model more robust to complex and rich visual details as well as employing more sophisticated models for better applicability in real farming settings.",

            "abstract": "Plant diseases are a critical threat to the agricultural sector. Therefore, accurate plant disease classification is important. In recent years, some researchers have used synthetic images of GAN to enhance plant disease recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial classified network (GACN) to further improve plant disease recognition accuracy. The GACN comprises a generator, discriminator, and classifier. The proposed model can not only enhance convolutional neural network performance by generating synthetic images to balance plant disease datasets but the GACN classifier can also be directly applied to plant disease recognition tasks. Experimental results on the PlantVillage and AI Challenger 2018 datasets show that the contribution of the proposed method to improve the discriminability of the convolution neural network is greater than that of the label-conditional methods of CGAN, ACGAN, BAGAN, and MFC-GAN. The accuracy of the trained classifier for plant disease recognition is also better than that of the plant disease recognition models studied on public plant disease datasets. In addition, we conducted several experiments to observe the effects of different numbers and resolutions of synthetic images on the discriminability of convolutional neural network.",

        "abstract": "Rice leaf infections are a common hazard to rice production, affecting many farmers all over the world. Early detection and treatment of rice leaf infection are critical for promoting healthy rice plant growth and ensuring adequate supply for the fast-growing population. Computer-assisted rice leaf disease diagnoses are hampered due to strong image backgrounds. Popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture extracts the features from images and diagnoses the disease to address the issues above. However, this method is best suitable for segmented images and gives low accuracy with real-time images. In this case, the Internet of Things is a paradigm shift that collects agro-meteorological information that effectively helps diagnose rice diseases. Motivated by the usefulness of CNN models and agricultural IoT, a novel multimodal data fusion framework named Rice-Fusion is proposed to diagnose rice disease. Rice disease diagnosis based on a single modality may not be accurate, and hence the fusion of heterogeneous modalities is essential for robust and reliable disease diagnosis. This gives a new dimension to the domain of rice disease diagnosis. The dataset was collected manually with 3200 rice health category samples using two modalities, namely agro-meteorological sensors and a camera. The Rice-Fusion framework initially extracts the numerical features from agro-meteorological data collected from sensors. Next, it extracts the visual features from the captured rice images. These extracted features are further fused using a concatenation layer followed by a dense layer, which provides single output for diagnosing the rice disease. The testing accuracy of Rice-Fusion is 95.31% as opposed to other unimodal framework accuracies of 82.03% and 91.25% based on CNN and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures, respectively. Experimental results analysis demonstrates that the proposed Rice-Fusion multimodal data fusion framework outperforms the outcome of unimodal frameworks.",

In order to help the farmers, it is a vital role to prevent the crop disease. If not done then huge amount of loss will happen to them. To address this problem a naïve model is designed for the monitoring of crop disease with help of the sensors. Internet of things (IoT) is a promising technology which provides efficient and relevant solutions towards the modernization of agricultural domains. Humidity and Temperature sensor is deployed to verify the humidity and the atmospheric temperature of the plant. Similarly soil moisture sensor is deployed and to get status of the soil. Sensors, webcam, GSM and Controllers are used for receiving the data from the groundnut farm. The received data is analyzed using machine learning models (XG boost) and so the prediction of crop disease is done. Thus a novel approach for preventing the crop disease (Groundnut Crop) is proposed and the prediction is intimated to farmers through SMS/E-mail.",

This makes it easier to take proactive steps to reduce losses before they occur.

The four major diseases that occur on rice crops are focused on this paper (namely Rice Blast, False Smut, Bacterial Blight and Brown Spot) as these diseases spread rapidly and lead to economic loss. This research paper demonstrates the usage of artificial neural network (ANN) to detect, classify and predict the occurrence of rice diseases based on diverse agro-meteorological conditions. The results were carried out on two cases of dataset split that is 70–30% and 80–20%. The various types of activation function (AF) such as sigmoid, tanH, ReLU and softmax are implemented and compared based on various evaluation metrics such as overall Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score. It can be concluded that the softmax AF applied to 70–30% split of dataset gives the highest accuracy of 92.15% in rice disease prediction.",

This work provides a method for reducing dimensionality using a median-based discriminatory analysis, which considers the adverse impact on the class mean caused by outliers, referred to as an enhanced linear discriminant analysis (ELDA). ELDA is based on a point-to-median distance, used as a measure metric to describe the within-class and between-class median scatter. The standard LDA algorithm may not be effective when the class distribution is uneven, and the limited sample size for inequality datasets and outliers persists. To address all issues, the proposed ELDA method is applied for cashew leaf disease identification on the cashew crop disease database (CCDDB), and it is more accurate at identifying and classifying cashew leaf illnesses in different sets of training and testing samples on three datasets. Research exhibits greater accuracy on CCDDB with 97.7%, on image database of plant disease symptoms dataset with 99.8%, and on dataset for crop pest and disease detection with 81.7%.",

        "title": "Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using Efficient Image Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms",
        "abstract": "India is often described as a country of villages, where a majority of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. The landscape of Indian agriculture is approximately 159.7 million hectares. Agriculture plays a pivotal role in India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounting for about 18% of the nation's economic output. Diseases and pests can have detrimental effects on crops, leading to reduced yields. These challenges can include the spread of plant diseases, infestations by insects or other pests, and the overall degradation of crop health. Early detection of diseases in crops is crucial for several reasons. Detecting diseases at an early stage allows for prompt intervention, such as applying appropriate pesticides or taking preventive measures. The main aim of this study is to develop a highly effective method for plant leaf disease detection using computer vision techniques. Here, leaf disease detection comprises histogram equalization, denoising, image color threshold masking, feature descriptors such as Haralick textures, Hu moments, and color histograms to extract the salient features of leaf images. These features are then used to classify the images by training Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms using K-fold validation. K-fold validation is used to separate the validation samples from the training samples, and the K indicates the number of times this is repeated for the generalization. The training and validation processes are performed in two approaches. The first approach uses default hyperparameters with segmented and non-segmented images. In the second approach, all hyperparameters of the models are optimized to train segmented datasets. The classification accuracy improved by 2.19% by utilizing segmentation and hyperparameter tuning further improved by 0.48%. The highest average classification accuracy of 97.92% is achieved using the Random Forest classifier to classify 40 classes of 10 different plant species. Accurate detection of plant disease leads to the sustained growth of plants throughout the growing span of the plants.",

The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path toward smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.",

FE is the process of extracting relevant information from raw data. However, the problem of extracting appropriate features that can reflect the intrinsic content of a piece of data or dataset as complete as possible is still a challenge for most FE techniques. In this paper, we present a survey of the existing FE techniques used in recent times. In this study, it was observed that the most unique features that can be extracted when using GLDS features on images are contrast, homogeneity, entropy, mean and energy. In addition, it was observed that FE techniques are not mainly application specific but can be applied to several applications.",

However, existing works in this field only perform simple image transformation methods. These simple transformations have not considered color encoding and pixel rendering techniques on the performance of machine learning classifiers. In this article, we propose a novel approach to encoding and arranging bytes from binary files into images. These developed images contain statistical (eg, entropy) and syntactic artifacts (eg, strings), and their pixels are filled up using space‐filling curves. Thanks to these features, our encoding method surpasses existing methods demonstrated by extensive experiments. In particular, our proposed method achieved 93.01% accuracy using the combination of the entropy encoding and character class scheme on the Hilbert curve.",

Plant disease may cause significant losses in food production and eradicate diversity in species. Early diagnosis of plant diseases using accurate or automatic detection techniques can enhance the quality of food production and minimize economic losses. In recent years, deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in the recognition accuracy of image classification and object detection systems. Hence, in this paper, we utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pre-trained models for efficient plant disease identification. We focused on fine tuning the hyperparameters of popular pre-trained models, such as DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4. The experiments were carried out using the popular PlantVillage dataset, which has 54,305 image samples of different plant disease species in 38 classes. The performance of the model was evaluated through classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. A comparative analysis was also performed with similar state-of-the-art studies. The experiments proved that DenseNet-121 achieved 99.81% higher classification accuracy, which was superior to state-of-the-art models.",

            "abstract": "The identification of corn leaf diseases in a real field environment faces several difficulties, such as complex background disturbances, variations and irregularities in the lesion areas, and large intra-class and small inter-class disparities. Traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have a low recognition accuracy and a large number of parameters. In this study, a lightweight corn disease identification model called DFCANet (Double Fusion block with Coordinate Attention Network) is proposed. The DFCANet consists mainly of two components: The dual feature fusion with coordinate attention and the Down-Sampling (DS) modules. The DFCA block contains dual feature fusion and Coordinate Attention (CA) modules. In order to completely fuse the shallow and deep features, these features were fused twice. The CA module suppresses the background noise and focuses on the diseased area. In addition, the DS module is used for down-sampling. It reduces the loss of information by expanding the feature channel dimension and the Depthwise convolution. The results show that DFCANet has an average recognition accuracy of 98.47%. It is more efficient at identifying corn leaf diseases in real scene images, compared with VGG16 (96.63%), ResNet50 (93.27%), EffcientNet-B0 (97.24%), ConvNeXt-B (94.18%), DenseNet121 (95.71%), MobileNet-V2 (95.41%), MobileNetv3-Large (96.33%), and ShuffleNetV2-1.0× (94.80%) methods. Moreover, the model’s Params and Flops are 1.91M and 309.1M, respectively, which are lower than heavyweight network models and most lightweight network models. In general, this study provides a novel, lightweight, and efficient convolutional neural network model for corn disease identification.",

A significant portion of the economy is dependent on agricultural output, thus when a disease is incorrectly identified, there will be a significant loss in crop yield and the economic value of food. The cost of traditional procedures is quite low, but they need human labour to visually inspect the plant's leaf patterns and identify the disease, as well as more time and laborious effort from farmers. Software-based methods for detecting leaf illnesses involve a significant amount of work, expertise in leaf diseases, and longer processing times for the diagnosis. Based on the KNN Classifier, we have suggested image processing for identifying leaf disease. The procedure for identifying a disease includes image preprocessing, contrast enhancement, RGB conversion, feature extraction, segmentation, and classification using K-nearest neighbour algorithms. The quality of the splint samples is improved by using Histogram Equalization, which is initially applied to the samples of leaves after they have been shrunk to 256x256 pixels and image-preprocessed. The instructional characteristics of the splint samples are valued using a matrix called the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix. Using machine learning techniques akin to K-Nearest Neighbor, the characteristics are categorized (K- NN). K- NN is used to evaluate the proposed model's quality.",

There has been a lot of work done by researchers to categorize tomato plant illnesses, but it is still difficult to quickly identify many tomato leaf diseases since healthy and diseased regions of the plant's leaves seem so similar. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful deep learning (DL) approach for disease classification in tomato plant leaves that we have developed to overcome the concerns mentioned above. The Plant Village Kaggle dataset, which is often used and readily accessible, was utilized. The proposed method provides a low-cost, image-resilient solution for tomato leaf disease classification that holds up under different lighting conditions, different colors, and different orientations of the affected area. Upon evaluating the suggested CNN model across many parameters, it attains an accuracy rate of 95%.",

            "abstract": "Hyperspectral sensors enable the study of the chemical properties of scene materials remotely for the purpose of identification, detection, and chemical composition analysis of objects in the environment. Hence, hyperspectral images captured from earth observing satellites and aircraft have been increasingly important in agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning, mining, and defense. Machine learning algorithms due to their outstanding predictive power have become a key tool for modern hyperspectral image analysis. Therefore, a solid understanding of machine learning techniques have become essential for remote sensing researchers and practitioners. This paper reviews and compares recent machine learning-based hyperspectral image analysis methods published in literature. We organize the methods by the image analysis task and by the type of machine learning algorithm, and present a two-way mapping between the image analysis tasks and the types of machine learning algorithms that can be applied to them. The paper is comprehensive in coverage of both hyperspectral image analysis tasks and machine learning algorithms. The image analysis tasks considered are land cover classification, target detection, unmixing, and physical parameter estimation. The machine learning algorithms covered are Gaussian models, linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, Gaussian mixture model, latent linear models, sparse linear models, Gaussian mixture models, ensemble learning, directed graphical models, undirected graphical models, clustering, Gaussian processes, Dirichlet processes, and deep learning. We also discuss the open challenges in the field of hyperspectral image analysis and explore possible future directions.",

In this paper, deep convolutional-neural-network (CNN) models are implemented to identify and diagnose diseases in plants from their leaves, since CNNs have achieved impressive results in the field of machine vision. Standard CNN models require a large number of parameters and higher computation cost. In this paper, we replaced standard convolution with depth=separable convolution, which reduces the parameter number and computation cost. The implemented models were trained with an open dataset consisting of 14 different plant species, and 38 different categorical disease classes and healthy plant leaves. To evaluate the performance of the models, different parameters such as batch size, dropout, and different numbers of epochs were incorporated. The implemented models achieved a disease-classification accuracy rates of 98.42%, 99.11%, 97.02%, and 99.56% using InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0, respectively, which were greater than that of traditional handcrafted-feature-based approaches. In comparison with other deep-learning models, the implemented model achieved better performance in terms of accuracy and it required less training time. Moreover, the MobileNetV2 architecture is compatible with mobile devices using the optimized parameter. The accuracy results in the identification of diseases showed that the deep CNN model is promising and can greatly impact the efficient identification of the diseases, and may have potential in the detection of diseases in real-time agricultural systems.",

            "abstract": ": The tomato holds significant global significance as a crop, fulfilling crucial roles in agriculture and meeting essential human dietary requirements. The persistent presence of diseases poses a significant risk to tomato crops, compromising their productivity and economic viability. This study presents a novel approach that combines the vision transformer (ViT) with deep neural networks (DNN) to identify tomato leaf diseases. This research aims to develop a methodology for identifying tomato leaf diseases, specifically focusing on enhancing the model's performance and interpretability. The proposed technique integrates an improved multi-head self attention mechanism with L1-norm attention, enhancing its ability to capture essential image features. The capability of ViT to process images as sequences of patches is harnessed and integrated with the interpretative and classifying prowess of DNN. To train and test the model, we utilize a comprehensive dataset of 18,160 tomato leaf images classified into ten different disease types. According to the experimental findings, the proposed model achieved an exceptional accuracy rate of 99.74%. The proposed method surpasses other contemporary techniques in terms of both accuracy and precision (99.66%), recall (99.39%), and F1-score (99.53%) for disease classification. The model's exceptional performance highlights its potential for practical implementation in diagnosing tomato diseases. In conclusion, this study presents a novel and efficient method for detecting tomato leaf diseases, which fulfills the current agricultural need for scalable and precise techniques. The fusion of vision transformers and deep neural networks offers a robust solution with exceptional accuracy and interpretability, contributing to the sustainable cultivation of this crucial crop.",

However, farmers' dependence on traditional manual methods sometimes makes it difficult to diagnose certain illnesses with accuracy. The application of the the VGG16 model, also known as CNN, for the detection then identification of plant leaf diseases is investigated in this study. In order to create sophisticated disease prediction algorithms for agriculture, the study makes use of the extensive Plant Village A database, which contains more than 70,000 images of both healthy then sick leaves of crops from fourteen distinct species. Data augmentation methods including horizontal flipping and histogram equalization remained castoff to improve the dataset then increase the model's flexibility. The performance of the VGG16 model had been thoroughly assessed by contrasting it with well-known CNN designs including ResNet, Inception-V3 and VGG-19. With the help of the Plant Village dataset, proposed work produced an impressive 99.12% accuracy rate. With values near 0.99, evaluation criteria such as recall, precision, F1-score, then accuracy continuously showed excellent performance, confirming the effectiveness of the suggested strategy. The study's discoveries determine the usefulness of VGG16 as a potent tool for precise disease diagnosis and point to important developments in plant disease detection. Because they make it possible to use better crop protection and disease control techniques, these advancements are extremely valuable to all parties involved in agriculture, including farmers including researchers.",

            "abstract": "Apple leaf disease is one of the main factors to constrain the apple production and quality. It takes a long time to detect the diseases by using the traditional diagnostic approach, thus farmers often miss the best time to prevent and treat the diseases. Apple leaf disease recognition based on leaf image is an essential research topic in the field of computer vision, where the key task is to find an effective way to represent the diseased leaf images. In this research, based on image processing techniques and pattern recognition methods, an apple leaf disease recognition method was proposed. A color transformation structure for the input RGB (Red, Green and Blue) image was designed firstly and then RGB model was converted to HSI (Hue, Saturation and Intensity), YUV and gray models. The background was removed based on a specific threshold value, and then the disease spot image was segmented with region growing algorithm (RGA). Thirty-eight classifying features of color, texture and shape were extracted from each spot image. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and improve the accuracy of the apple leaf disease identification, the most valuable features were selected by combining genetic algorithm (GA) and correlation based feature selection (CFS). Finally, the diseases were recognized by SVM classifier. In the proposed method, the selected feature subset was globally optimum. The experimental results of more than 90% correct identification rate on the apple diseased leaf image database which contains 90 disease images for there kinds of apple leaf diseases, powdery mildew, mosaic and rust, demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible and effective. \nKeywords: apple leaf disease, diseased leaf recognition, region growing algorithm (RGA), genetic algorithm and correlation based feature selection (GA-CFS) \nDOI: 10.3965/j.ijabe.20171002.2166",

            "abstract": "In response to the difficulty of plant leaf disease detection and classification, this study proposes a novel plant leaf disease detection method called deep block attention SSD (DBA_SSD) for disease identification and disease degree classification of plant leaves. We propose three plant leaf detection methods, namely, squeeze-and-excitation SSD (Se_SSD), deep block SSD (DB_SSD), and DBA_SSD. Se_SSD fuses SSD feature extraction network and attention mechanism channel, DB_SSD improves VGG feature extraction network, and DBA_SSD fuses the improved VGG network and channel attention mechanism. To reduce the training time and accelerate the training process, the convolutional layers trained in the Image Net image dataset by the VGG model are migrated to this model, whereas the collected plant leaves disease image dataset is randomly divided into training set, validation set, and test set in the ratio of 8:1:1. We chose the PlantVillage dataset after careful consideration because it contains images related to the domain of interest. This dataset consists of images of 14 plants, including images of apples, tomatoes, strawberries, peppers, and potatoes, as well as the leaves of other plants. In addition, data enhancement methods, such as histogram equalization and horizontal flip were used to expand the image data. The performance of the three improved algorithms is compared and analyzed in the same environment and with the classical target detection algorithms YOLOv4, YOLOv3, Faster RCNN, and YOLOv4 tiny. Experiments show that DBA_SSD outperforms the two other improved algorithms, and its performance in comparative analysis is superior to other target detection algorithms.",

These proposed methods were used to improve the target recognition effect of the network model. In the experimental phase, to verify the effectiveness of the model, sample images were randomly selected from the constructed rubber tree disease database to form training and test sets. The test results showed that the mean average precision of the improved YOLOv5 network reached 70%, which is 5.4% higher than that of the original YOLOv5 network. The precision values of this model for powdery mildew and anthracnose detection were 86.5% and 86.8%, respectively. The overall detection performance of the improved YOLOv5 network was significantly better compared with those of the original YOLOv5 and the YOLOX_nano network models. The improved model accurately identified plant diseases under natural conditions, and it provides a technical reference for the prevention and control of plant diseases.",

Plant disease may cause significant losses in food production and eradicate diversity in species. Early diagnosis of plant diseases using accurate or automatic detection techniques can enhance the quality of food production and minimize economic losses. In recent years, deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in the recognition accuracy of image classification and object detection systems. Hence, in this paper, we utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pre-trained models for efficient plant disease identification. We focused on fine tuning the hyperparameters of popular pre-trained models, such as DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4. The experiments were carried out using the popular PlantVillage dataset, which has 54,305 image samples of different plant disease species in 38 classes. The performance of the model was evaluated through classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. A comparative analysis was also performed with similar state-of-the-art studies. The experiments proved that DenseNet-121 achieved 99.81% higher classification accuracy, which was superior to state-of-the-art models.",

Most critical and challenging problem in farming is the early detection of plant diseases. In this research, an AI-Deep learning based automated plant disease detection method using FPN with Faster R-CNN architecture is proposed. In this work, we evaluated our proposed method on disease detection with main outcome measure of Intersection over Union (IoU) ratio (ratio of overlap between predicted and annotated bounding boxes), precision (ratio of true predictions to total predictions), recall (ratio of true predictions to annotated bounding boxes) and disease spread direction. Our method is experimented on Bacterial Spot detection in bell-pepper plant leaf images obtained from the PlantVillage dataset. The proposed model achieved average precision 100% and average recall 99.7% for an IoU ratio of 0.5; mean average precision was 99.5% and mean average recall was 99.1% for an IoU of 0.5-0.95. We then evaluated our DeepTrac module using video data which is then plot the disease spread directions to understand the pattern of bacterial spot spread in bell-pepper leaf. Our future work may include the application of our AI method to detect plant diseases on the drone-obtained plant images.",

But pyramid representations have been avoided in recent object detectors that are based on deep convolutional networks, partially because they are slow to compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.",

Such innovations will help overcome the complexities of disease identification under the challenging real field conditions and lead to improved accuracy of diagnoses in disease management for enhanced crop yields. A research architecture called ResNet-50 pre-trained using the ImageNet dataset was fine-tuned for the PlantVillage dataset-consisting of more than 54,000 healthy and diseased images in 38 classes. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling were also applied for enhancing the robustness of the model. The training and validation of the model were performed in an 80-20 dataset split, and the performance evaluation was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. The ResNet-50 model achieved an accuracy of 98.7% on the test set. Thus, it outperformed conventional machine learning strategies and simple CNN architectures employed. High precision and recall values were achieved, especially for clearly distinguishable diseases with visual symptoms like tomato early blight and potato late blight. However, the precision and recall of the model were lower concerning diseases with similar or subtle symptoms; therefore, future works required further improvement. Results demonstrate that ResNet-based deep learning models effectively detect and classify plant disease very accurately.

An accurate and automatic identification of leaf diseases could help to develop an early response to reduce economic losses. Recent research in plant diseases has adopted deep neural networks. However, such research has used the models as a black-box passing the labeled images through the networks. This letter presents an analysis of the network weights for the automatic recognition of soybean leaf diseases applied to images taken straight from a small and cheap unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To achieve high accuracy, we evaluated four deep neural network models trained with different parameters for fine-tuning (FT) and transfer learning. Data augmentation and dropout were used during the network training to avoid overfitting. Our methodology consists of using the SLIC method to segment the plant leaves in the top-view images obtained during the flight. We tested our data set created from real flight inspections in an end-to-end computer vision approach. Results strongly suggest that the FT of parameters substantially improves the identification accuracy.",

This article throws light upon such techniques in the form of a survey that had been carried out comprehensively covering various image based plant leaf diseases. Such diseases are mostly grievous and they strike at any part of the plant. There are huge accumulated losses due to such diseases that bring down the productivity and increase the economic losses in the agricultural industry. Agriculture industry needs to sustain and evolve from such obstacles to be highly profitable. This can be done by precisely monitoring the health and detecting the diseases at appropriate stages of the plant’s life time. Technology has spread its wings in every field of day to day life but still its reach in the field of agriculture is not up to the mark. Agriculture industry is still thriving on outdated technical methodologies. Improper diagnosis of plant disease may lead to huge losses in terms of production, time, cost and product quality. The condition of the plant needs to be tracked throughout its growing stages leading to successful cultivation. As part of technological innovation, researchers had been applying the image processing techniques for monitoring as well as diagnosing the plant diseases in its various stages. Appropriate machine learning algorithms are being designed and applied for precisely identifying the various infections on plants throughout its life cycle and the type of treatment that can be afforded for overcoming loss.",

            "abstract": "Recently, many Deep Learning models have been employed to classify different kinds of plant diseases, but very little work has been done for disease severity detection. However, it is more important to master the severities of plant diseases accurately and timely, as it helps to make effective decisions to protect the plants from being further infected and reduce financial loss. In this paper, based on the Huanglongbing (HLB)-infected leaf images obtained from PlantVillage and crowdAI, we created a dataset with 5,406 citrus leaf images infected by HLB. Then six different kinds of popular models were trained to perform the severity detection of citrus HLB with the goal to find which types of models are more suitable to detect HLB severity with the same training circumstance. The experimental results show that the Inception_v3 model with epochs=60 can achieve higher accuracy than that of other models for severity detection with an accuracy of 74.38% due to its highly computational efficiency and small number of parameters. Additionally, aiming for evaluating whether GANs-based data augmentation can contribute to improve the model learning performance, we adopted DCGANs (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) to augment the original training dataset up to two times itself. Finally, a new training dataset with 14,056 leaf images composed by the original training images and the augmented ones were used to train the Inception_v3 model. As a result, we achieved an accuracy of 92.60%, about 20% higher than that of the Inception_v3 model trained by the original training dataset, which suggested that the GANs-based data augmentation is very useful to improve the model learning performance.",

            "abstract": "Plant diseases compose a great threat to global food security. However, the rapid identification of plant diseases remains challenging and time-consuming. It requires experts to accurately identify if the plant is healthy or not and identify the type of infection. Deep learning techniques have recently been used to identify and diagnose diseased plants from digital images to help automate plant disease diagnosis and help non-experts identify diseased plants. While many deep learning applications have been used to identify diseased plants and aims to increase the detection rate, the limitation of the large parameter size in the models persist. In this paper, an end-to-end deep learning model is developed to identify healthy and unhealthy corn plant leaves while taking into consideration the number of parameters of the model. The proposed model utilizes two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), EfficientNetB0, and DenseNet121, to extract deep features from the corn plant images.The deep features extracted from each CNN are then fused using the concatenation technique to produce a more complex feature set from which the model can learn better about the dataset. In this paper, data augmentation techniques were used to add variations to the images in the dataset used to train the model, increasing the variety and number of the images and enabling the model to learn more complex cases of the data. The obtained result of this work is compared with other pre-trained CNN models, namely ResNet152 and InceptionV3, which have a larger number of parameters than the proposed model and require more processing power. The proposed model is able to achieve a classification accuracy of 98.56% which shows the superiority of the proposed model over ResNet152 and InceptionV3 that achieved a classification accuracy of 98.37% and 96.26% respectively.",

            "abstract": "The global generation of renewable energy has rapidly increased, primarily due to the installation of large-scale renewable energy power plants. However, monitoring renewable energy assets in these large plants remains challenging due to environmental factors that could result in reduced power generation, malfunctioning, and degradation of asset life. Therefore, the detection of surface defects on renewable energy assets is crucial for maintaining the performance and efficiency of these plants. This paper proposes an innovative detection framework to achieve an economical surface monitoring system for renewable energy assets. High-resolution images of the assets are captured regularly and inspected to identify surface or structural damages on solar panels and wind turbine blades. {Vision transformer (ViT), one of the latest attention-based deep learning (DL) models in computer vision, is proposed in this work to classify surface defects.} The ViT model outperforms other DL models, including MobileNet, VGG16, Xception, EfficientNetB7, and ResNet50, achieving high accuracy scores above 97\\% for both wind and solar plant assets. From the results, our proposed model demonstrates its potential for monitoring and detecting damages in renewable energy assets for efficient and reliable operation of renewable power plants.",

Identification and detection are essential components of contemporary agro technology. In this case, AI technology was utilized to identify a disease in rose plants, although plant disease detection is difficult for sustainable agriculture. There are several instances of rose plant disease, and as a result, fascinating decoration is being lost. Due to this situation, which is getting worse every day in Bangladesh, the economy of agricultural sector is suffering. Bangladesh's population relies heavily on agriculture industry for their revenue. This study includes some disease detection of rose plants, albeit not all plants are affected equally by the illness. The plant leaf provides the plant with vital sustenance. When a leaf is ill, the plant is at its most vulnerable. Due to the accessibility of the sick leaf, disease identification is difficult. Agriculture field must be properly assessed to see significant improvements in proposed work. The best resource for creating this kind of disease detection model is deep learning technology. Image pre-processing and model analysis are steps in the disease detection construction process. Few CNN architectures are used in this study, including ResNet50, VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group), MobileNetV2, and Inception V3. Four diseases have been identified in rose plant leaves. Here, image processing is investigated using a discovered approach and obtain a MobileNetV2 model accuracy of 96.11%.",

            "abstract": "Plant pests and diseases are a significant threat to almost all major types of plants and global food security. Traditional inspection across different plant fields is time-consuming and impractical for a wider plantation size, thus reducing crop production. Therefore, many smart agricultural practices are deployed to control plant diseases and pests. Most of these approaches, for example, use vision-based artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), or deep learning (DL) methods and models to provide disease detection solutions. However, existing open issues must be considered and addressed before AI methods can be used. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) and present a detailed survey of the studies employing data collection techniques and publicly available datasets. To begin the review, 1349 papers were chosen from five major academic databases, namely Springer, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ACM library. After deploying a comprehensive screening process, the review considered 176 final studies based on the importance of the method. Several crops, including grapes, rice, apples, cucumbers, maize, tomatoes, wheat, and potatoes, have tested mainly on the hyperspectral imagery and vision-centered approaches. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic regression (LR) classifiers demonstrated an increased accuracy in experiments compared to traditional classifiers. Besides the image taxonomy, disease localization is depicted in these approaches as a bottle neck to disease detection. Cognitive CNNs with attention mechanisms and transfer learning are showing an increasing trend. There is no standard model performance assessment though the majority use accuracy, recall, precision, F1 Score, and confusion matrix. The available 11 datasets are laboratory and in-field based, and 9 are publicly available. Some laboratory-based datasets are considerably small, making them impractical in experiments. Finally, there is a need to avail models with fewer parameters, implementable on small devices and large datasets accommodating several crops and diseases to have robust models.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is vital to the success of India's economy. Loss of crops and future disease propagation can be avoided if plant diseases are detected early. For the sake of human health worldwide, early identification of plant diseases is essential. In the past, a pathologist would have to physically inspect each plant to make a diagnosis. However, due to lower precision and limited availability of human resources, manual examination for agricultural diseases is restricted. Automated methods for spotting and labelling plant diseases are in high demand as a solution to this kind of problem. The recent achievements of DL in computer vision for plant disease categorization have served as inspiration for several publications. Unfortunately, the deficit translucence in these end-to-end deep classifiers can limit their practical application. We presented convolutional neural networks using the Resnet50 network to address the issues mentioned earlier. In this study, we use DL for the problem of disease classification in plants. Due to its immense success in image-based classification, the convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used. We can look at ResNet50 with Adam Optimizer to improve the system's accuracy. In this case, crop leaf images are used as input, and the system will “stumble on” the presence of disorder after processing the image. If a disease is found, the results will specify its kind and may suggest solutions like insecticides or other chemicals. The dataset is used to train the CNN model and previously trained models like VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet. The Resnet50 Network model is the most accurate of these. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art approaches by producing a 99.02% accuracy rate.",

High utility itemset mining finds the high utility itemsets from the dataset, the high itemset discovers the profitable and useful patterns. Mining high utility itemset is challenging compared to mining association rule mining algorithm since the downward closure property is not satisfied in high utility itemset mining. Various state-of-the algorithms have been proposed to mine high utility itemset. In this paper a novel tree based data structure to mine high utility itemset is proposed and different pruning strategies is employed to effectively mine high utility itemset. The proposed idea is evaluated on 4 real time datasets. The result shows that the proposed algorithm performs better than the state-of –the-art algorithms in terms of memory and execution time.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the world, bananas are grown as a staple crop that contributes significantly to the economy. However, diseases like banana leaf wilt pose serious hazards that, if left unchecked, might lead to devastating crop losses. In this study, we introduce a fresh method for dealing with this issue by creating a model that combines features of both a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our model uses deep learning (DL) to categorize the severity of banana leaf wilt, empowering farmers to take preventative measures as soon as the disease is detected. We started by compiling a large collection of banana leaf photos, which were then labeled by domain experts according to severity. The quality and diversity of the dataset were guaranteed by employing data pretreatment and augmentation strategies. As the feature extractor, the selected pre-trained CNN architecture captured subtle patterns that are highly predictive of illness severity. In addition to a remarkable 94.77% overall accuracy, our hybrid model also offered a sophisticated evaluation of illness development. To provide farmers with accurate insights regarding the state of their crops, performance parameters such as precision, recall, and Fl-score were calculated for each severity level. In addition, a comparison with state-of-the-art models in the field confirmed the model's superiority. Its potential as a game-changing tool for illness severity classification was reaffirmed by its repeated outperformance of previous techniques.",

Developing an automatic pneumonia detection system is crucial to detect and treat pneumonia disease. Hence, an innovative approach is proposed to detect pneumonia by utilizing the ensemble of deep learning models, specifically VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3. The ensemble method integrates predictions from these various architectures to enhance overall classification performance. Rather than starting the training of each model from the beginning, transfer learning techniques are utilized to fine-tune Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using a pre-existing knowledge base. This involves leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them specifically for the disease diagnose on Chest X-ray image dataset. The features are extracted from VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 models and the classes of disease are predicted by using softmax layers. Finally, ensemble learning is employed to fuse the predictions of multiple neural network architectures within Tri-UnityNet, enhancing its accuracy and robustness in pneumonia detection. By leveraging the complementary strengths of diverse models, the ensemble approach achieves superior performance, contributing to more reliable diagnostic outcomes.",

To study plant illnesses, one must examine the outward symptoms produced by the plant in question. It is also essential for long-term husbandry that plant health be monitored and complaints about diseases made. Disease auditing in plants is tedious work that requires special equipment. It takes a huge commitment of time, courage when dealing with plant illnesses, and fortitude to endure the devilishly long processing time. As a result, landing the photos of the leaves and comparing it with the data sets is how image processing is employed for the detection of plant conditions. To learn to distinguish between photos of unhealthy and healthy leaves, a group of computers is trained on datasets of both types.

            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

However, plant diseases are threatening the livelihood of this important source. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated great performance (beating that of humans) in object recognition and image classification problems. This paper describes the feasibility of CNN for plant disease classification for leaf images taken under the natural environment. The model is designed based on the LeNet architecture to perform the soybean plant disease classification. 12,673 samples containing leaf images of four classes, including the healthy leaf images, were obtained from the PlantVillage database. The images were taken under uncontrolled environment. The implemented model achieves 99.32% classification accuracy which show clearly that CNN can extract important features and classify plant diseases from images taken in the natural environment.",

            "title": "Adaptive Thresholding of CNN Features for Maize Leaf Disease Classification and Severity Estimation",
            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the gold standard in the machine learning (ML) community. As a result, most of the recent studies have relied on CNNs, which have achieved higher accuracies compared with traditional machine learning approaches. From prior research, we learned that multi-class image classification models can solve leaf disease identification problems, and multi-label image classification models can solve leaf disease quantification problems (severity analysis). Historically, maize leaf disease severity analysis or quantification has always relied on domain knowledge—that is, experts evaluate the images and train the CNN models based on their knowledge. Here, we propose a unique system that achieves the same objective while excluding input from specialists. This avoids bias and does not rely on a “human in the loop model” for disease quantification. The advantages of the proposed system are many. Notably, the conventional system of maize leaf disease quantification is labor intensive, time-consuming and prone to errors since it lacks standardized diagnosis guidelines. In this work, we present an approach to quantify maize leaf disease based on adaptive thresholding. The experimental work of our study is in three parts. First, we train a wide variety of well-known deep learning models for maize leaf disease classification, then we compare the performance of the deep learning models and finally extract the class activation heatmaps from the prediction layers of the CNN models. Second, we develop an adaptive thresholding technique that automatically extracts the regions of interest from the class activation maps without any prior knowledge. Lastly, we use these regions of interest to estimate image leaf disease severity. Experimental results show that transfer learning approaches can classify maize leaf diseases with up to 99% accuracy. With a high quantification accuracy, our proposed adaptive thresholding method for CNN class activation maps can be a valuable contribution to quantifying maize leaf diseases without relying on domain knowledge.",

Early detection and accurate diagnosis of leaf diseases can help prevent their spread and minimize crop losses. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great potential in image classification tasks, including disease detection in plants. In this study, we propose a CNN-based approach for the prediction of potato leaf diseases. The proposed method uses a pre-trained CNN model, which is fine-tuned on a dataset of potato leaf images. The dataset includes images of healthy leaves and leaves infected with different diseases such as early blight and late blight. The trained model is then used to classify new images of potato leaves into healthy or diseased categories. The proposed approach achieves 97.4% accuracy in the classification of potato leaf diseases such as early blight potato leaf disease and late blight potato leaf disease, and can be used as an effective tool for early detection and management of these diseases in potato crops.",

Our approach encompasses a comprehensive embedded electronic system, incorporating sensor data acquisition and image capturing from the plants.

The research introduces a novel model, ResNet9-SE, a modified ResNet architecture featuring two squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks strategically positioned within the network to enhance performance. The key advantage gained is achieving fewer parameters and occupying less memory while preserving a high diagnosis accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated using in-house collected data and a publicly available dataset. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the exceptional classification accuracy of the ResNet9-SE model (99.7%), coupled with significantly reduced computation costs, affirming its suitability for deployment in embedded systems.",

So to detect the plant diseases in advance and to detect the diseases with the help of modern computer technology, we proposed a model for the efficient distinguishing plant diseases.

            "abstract": "Plant health is the basis of agricultural development. Plant diseases are a major factor for crop losses in agriculture. Plant diseases are difficult to diagnose correctly, and the manual disease diagnosis process is time consuming. For this reason, it is highly desirable to automatically identify the diseases in strawberry plants to prevent loss of crop quality. Deep learning (DL) has recently gained popularity in image classification and identification due to its high accuracy and fast learning. In this research, deep learning models were used to identify the leaf scorch disease in strawberry plants. Four convolutional neural networks (SqueezeNet, EfficientNet-B3, VGG-16 and AlexNet) CNN models were trained and tested for the classification of healthy and leaf scorch disease infected plants. The performance accuracy of EfficientNet-B3 and VGG-16 was higher for the initial and severe stage of leaf scorch disease identification as compared to AlexNet and SqueezeNet. It was also observed that the severe disease (leaf scorch) stage was correctly classified more often than the initial stage of the disease. All the trained CNN models were integrated with a machine vision system for real-time image acquisition under two different lighting situations (natural and controlled) and identification of leaf scorch disease in strawberry plants. The field experiment results with controlled lightening arrangements, showed that the model EfficientNet-B3 achieved the highest classification accuracy, with 0.80 and 0.86 for initial and severe disease stages, respectively, in real-time. AlexNet achieved slightly lower validation accuracy (0.72, 0.79) in comparison with VGGNet and EfficientNet-B3. Experimental results stated that trained CNN models could be used in conjunction with variable rate agrochemical spraying systems, which will help farmers to reduce agrochemical use, crop input costs and environmental contamination.",

Based on the smart system management mechanism, cryptographic functions can be adapted to varying and real-time requirements, while the actuators can be controlled to interact with the physical world to ensure the healthy growth of crops. Experiments show when all the four cryptographic hardware modules, including RTEA32, RTEA64, XTEA32 and XTEA64, are supported, using the adaptive cryptography engine, 72.4% of slice LUTs and 68.4% of slice registers in terms of the Xilinx Zynq-7000 XC7Z020 chip can be saved. Through the smart system management mechanism, a power consumption of 0.009 watts can be reduced. Furthermore, using the binarized neural network (BNN) hardware module of the PDS estimator, the recognition accuracy of target crops i.e. dragon fruits can achieve 76.57%. Compared to the microprocessor-based design and the GPU accelerated one, the same BNN architecture on the FPGA can accelerate the frames per second by a factor of 4,919.29 and a factor of 1.08, respectively.",

Recent advancements in technology have shifted focus towards employing sophisticated tools like deep learning to improve the effectiveness and precision of disease management in crops. The setback of plant leaf diseases on contemporary agriculture is a pressing issue. Maize, a fundamental crop, is essential for global food security, yet it is increasingly threatened by a range of pets that redefine plant health. The study explores deep learning techniques for detection and diagnosis of diseases in maize leaves. By utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the study analyzes high-resolution maize leaf images to facilitate automated disease identification. The deep learning model is trained on both local and public datasets for the detection of diseases such as Blight, Common Blight and Gray Leaf Spot. A prediction accuracy of 96% was attained after extensive training of the deep learning model. The findings highlight the deep learning model’s capability to accurately identify and diagnose maize leaf diseases, illustrating its potential as an invaluable resource for farmers and agronomists. Incorporating this technology into precision agriculture can lead to earlier disease detection, timely interventions, and improved crop yields, fostering sustainable agricultural practices.",

            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

            "abstract": "In the lives of humans, agriculture is incredibly vital. Nearly 60% of the population is either directly or indirectly involved in agriculture. Farmers are not interested in using the traditional approach because there are no tools to identify diseases in different crops in an agricultural environment, daily raising the output of their agriculture. Early diagnosis of crop diseases is essential since they influence the growth of their species. Crop disease detection and classification has traditionally relied on a variety of Machine Learning (ML) models, and developments in a type of ML called Deep Learning (DL), this field of study seems to offer a lot of promise for increased accuracy. The suggested method effectively and precisely recognizes the symptoms of crop disease using a CNN and a deep neural network. Additionally, these solutions are evaluated using a variety of efficiency indicators. The DL models that are used to visualize agricultural diseases are fully described in this article. Also, some research holes are found that can provide more clarity for identifying plant diseases even before symptoms appear. Convolution neural network-based technology will be developed using the suggested methodology to identify plant leaf disease",

In order to solve the problem of automatic identification of peanut-leaf diseases, this paper uses a traditional machine-learning method to ensemble the output of a deep learning model to identify diseases of peanut leaves. The identification of peanut-leaf diseases included healthy leaves, rust disease on a single leaf, leaf-spot disease on a single leaf, scorch disease on a single leaf, and both rust disease and scorch disease on a single leaf. Three types of data-augmentation methods were used: image flipping, rotation, and scaling. In this experiment, the deep-learning model had a higher accuracy than the traditional machine-learning methods. Moreover, the deep-learning model achieved better performance when using data augmentation and a stacking ensemble. After ensemble by logistic regression, the accuracy of residual network with 50 layers (ResNet50) was as high as 97.59%, and the F1 score of dense convolutional network with 121 layers (DenseNet121) was as high as 90.50. The deep-learning model used in this experiment had the greatest improvement in F1 score after the logistic regression ensemble. Deep-learning networks with deeper network layers like ResNet50 and DenseNet121 performed better in this experiment. This study can provide a reference for the identification of peanut-leaf diseases.",

Furthermore, modern technology has improved the efficacy and precision of disease detection in plants and animals. Plant disease identification using various image processing approaches has recently been employed on a big scale to help farmers monitor their plantation areas. Based on the perpetuation and spread, the diseases can be floral, foliar, and soilborne. Grain production is typically affected by foliar diseases, which reduce photosynthetic area, duration, and function. Soil-borne conditions include vascular wilt, root rot, and damping-off; and can exhibit symptoms such as wilting of foliage, root decay, and sudden death. This paper highlights the significant issues and challenges for leaf disease classification. A comparative study of different methods based on the agricultural product, methodology, efficiency, advantages, and disadvantages is also included. The review study analyzes the most frequently used machine learning algorithms in the last five to seven years, revealing that Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been extensively used for disease classification. An analysis of specific Techniques (Feature Extraction plus machine learning-based Classification algorithm) and their associated accuracy is also performed, demonstrating that (ORB) features combined with Linear SVM provide the highest accuracy of 99.98%.",

To enable rapid and accurate diagnosis of cotton diseases and pests—thus supporting the development of effective control strategies and facilitating genetic breeding research—we propose a lightweight model, the Resource-efficient Cotton Network (RF-Cott-Net), alongside an open-source image dataset, CCDPHD-11, encompassing 11 disease categories. Built upon the MobileViTv2 backbone, RF-Cott-Net integrates an early exit mechanism and quantization-aware training (QAT) to enhance deployment efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results on CCDPHD-11 demonstrate that RF-Cott-Net achieves an accuracy of 98.4%, an F1-score of 98.4%, a precision of 98.5%, and a recall of 98.3%. With only 4.9 M parameters, 310 M FLOPs, an inference time of 3.8 ms, and a storage footprint of just 4.8 MB, RF-Cott-Net delivers outstanding accuracy and real-time performance, making it highly suitable for deployment on agricultural edge devices and providing robust support for in-field automated detection of cotton diseases and pests.",

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.",

We propose a quantization scheme that allows inference to be carried out using integer-only arithmetic, which can be implemented more efficiently than floating point inference on commonly available integer-only hardware. We also co-design a training procedure to preserve end-to-end model accuracy post quantization. As a result, the proposed quantization scheme improves the tradeoff between accuracy and on-device latency. The improvements are significant even on MobileNets, a model family known for run-time efficiency, and are demonstrated in ImageNet classification and COCO detection on popular CPUs.",

            "abstract": "We present the next generation of MobileNets based on a combination of complementary search techniques as well as a novel architecture design. MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2% more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 20% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 6.6% more accurate compared to a MobileNetV2 model with comparable latency. MobileNetV3-Large detection is over 25% faster at roughly the same accuracy as MobileNetV2 on COCO detection. MobileNetV3-Large LR-ASPP is 34% faster than MobileNetV2 R-ASPP at similar accuracy for Cityscapes segmentation.",

In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. \nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",

With an aid of precision agriculture along with the emerging technology, we could ensure the crops get optimum nutrition fixing the cons of traditional procedure. In this paper, Multi-Support Vector Machine based classification for cotton leaf disease is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses automatic snaps of the crops at every stage, process them at very early stages to determine their flaws, so that the farmer’s loss both in terms of money and goods to be hence avoided. The above said Multi-SVM algorithm are models that are either supervised by human or robot which, when fed with the essential data makes segmentation and classification of the types of illness. The Image processing is been implemented to get the capture of leaves at significant stages. This Multi-SVM when compared over the Convolutional Neural Networks has several advantages. While the Multi-SVM is global and unique, the Convolutional neural network suffers from multiple local minima. The complexity of computation of Multi-SVM does not depend on the dimensions of the input space while the Convolutional Neural Networks does. The reason why Multi-SVM outperform Convolutional Neural Network is Multi-SVMs are less prone to over fits.",

Further analyses show different behaviors in the BERT transformer layers and also reveal their redundancy.

Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.",

            "abstract": "Light-weight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the de-facto for mobile vision tasks. Their spatial inductive biases allow them to learn representations with fewer parameters across different vision tasks. However, these networks are spatially local. To learn global representations, self-attention-based vision trans-formers (ViTs) have been adopted. Unlike CNNs, ViTs are heavy-weight. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it possible to combine the strengths of CNNs and ViTs to build a light-weight and low latency network for mobile vision tasks? Towards this end, we introduce MobileViT, a light-weight and general-purpose vision transformer for mobile devices. MobileViT presents a different perspective for the global processing of information with transformers, i.e., transformers as convolutions. Our results show that MobileViT significantly outperforms CNN- and ViT-based networks across different tasks and datasets. On the ImageNet-1k dataset, MobileViT achieves top-1 accuracy of 78.4% with about 6 million parameters, which is 3.2% and 6.2% more accurate than MobileNetv3 (CNN-based) and DeIT (ViT-based) for a similar number of parameters. On the MS-COCO object detection task, MobileViT is 5.7% more accurate than MobileNetv3 for a similar number of parameters.

            "abstract": "Self-attention based models such as vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a very competitive architecture alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision. Despite increasingly stronger variants with ever-higher recognition accuracies, due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, existing ViTs are typically demanding in computation and model size. Although several successful design choices (e.g., the convolutions and hierarchical multi-stage structure) of prior CNNs have been reintroduced into recent ViTs, they are still not sufficient to meet the limited resource requirements of mobile devices. This motivates a very recent attempt to develop light ViTs based on the state-of-the-art MobileNet-v2, but still leaves a performance gap behind. In this work, pushing further along this under-studied direction we introduce EdgeViTs, a new family of light-weight ViTs that, for the first time, enable attention-based vision models to compete with the best light-weight CNNs in the tradeoff between accuracy and on-device efficiency. This is realized by introducing a highly cost-effective local-global-local (LGL) information exchange bottleneck based on optimal integration of self-attention and convolutions. For device-dedicated evaluation, rather than relying on inaccurate proxies like the number of FLOPs or parameters, we adopt a practical approach of focusing directly on on-device latency and, for the first time, energy efficiency. Specifically, we show that our models are Pareto-optimal when both accuracy-latency and accuracy-energy trade-offs are considered, achieving strict dominance over other ViTs in almost all cases and competing with the most efficient CNNs.

Recently published MobileViTv2 architecture removes fusion block and uses linear complexity transformers to perform better than MobileViTv1. We add our proposed fusion block to MobileViTv2 to create MobileViTv3-0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 models.

            "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) show excellent performance but are compute- and memory-intensive. Quantization can reduce memory and accelerate inference. However, existing methods cannot maintain accuracy and hardware efficiency at the same time. We propose SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs. Based on the fact that weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the activation outliers by offline migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation. SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of both weights and activations for all the matrix multiplications in LLMs, including OPT, BLOOM, GLM, MT-NLG, Llama-1/2, Falcon, Mistral, and Mixtral models. We demonstrate up to 1.56x speedup and 2x memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy. SmoothQuant enables serving 530B LLM within a single node. Our work offers a turn-key solution that reduces hardware costs and democratizes LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/smoothquant.",

            "abstract": "Aphids are one of the main pests of cotton and have been an important disaster limiting cotton yield. It is important to use satellite multispectral data to monitor the severity of cotton aphids in a timely and accurate manner on regional scale. Based on the combination of derivative of ratio spectra (DRS) and random forest (RF) algorithm, this study researched the quantitative monitoring model of cotton aphid severity based on Sentinel-2 data. First, the cotton area was extracted by using a supervised classification algorithm and the vegetation index threshold method. Then, the DRS algorithm was used to analyze the spectral characteristics of cotton aphids from three scales, and the Pearson correlation analysis algorithm was used to extract the bands significantly related to aphid infestation. Finally, the RF model was trained by ground sampling points and its accuracy was evaluated. The optimal model results were selected by the cross-validation method, and the accuracy was compared with the four classical classification algorithms. The results showed that (1) the canopy spectral reflectance curves at different grades of cotton aphid infestation were significantly different, with a significant positive correlation between cotton aphid grade and spectral reflectance in the visible band range and a negative correlation in the near-infrared band range; (2) The DRS algorithm could effectively remove the interference of the background endmember of satellite multispectral image pixels and enhance the aphid spectral features. The analysis results from three different scales and the evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in processing satellite multispectral data; (3) After the DRS processing, Sentinel-2 multispectral images could effectively classify the severity of cotton aphid infestation by the RF model with an overall classification accuracy of 80% and a kappa coefficient of 0.73. Compared with the results of four classical classification algorithms, the proposed algorithm has the best accuracy, which proves the superiority of RF. Based on satellite multispectral data, the DRS and RF can be combined to monitor the severity of cotton aphids on a regional scale, and the accuracy can meet the actual need.",

            "abstract": "Summary Verticillium dahliae is a widespread and destructive soilborne vascular pathogenic fungus that causes serious diseases in dicot plants. Here, comparative transcriptome analysis showed that the number of genes upregulated in defoliating pathotype V991 was significantly higher than in the non‐defoliating pathotype 1cd3‐2 during the early response of cotton. Combined with analysis of the secretome during the V991–cotton interaction, an elicitor VP2 was identified, which was highly upregulated at the early stage of V991 invasion, but was barely expressed during the 1cd3‐2‐cotton interaction. Full‐length VP2 could induce cell death in several plant species, and which was dependent on NbBAK1 but not on NbSOBIR1 in N. benthamiana. Knock‐out of VP2 attenuated the pathogenicity of V991. Furthermore, overexpression of VP2 in cotton enhanced resistance to V. dahliae without causing abnormal plant growth and development. Several genes involved in JA, SA and lignin synthesis were significantly upregulated in VP2‐overexpressing cotton. The contents of JA, SA, and lignin were also significantly higher than in the wild‐type control. In summary, the identified elicitor VP2, recognized by the receptor in the plant membrane, triggers the cotton immune response and enhances disease resistance.",

            "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have excelled in computer vision (CV) tasks but are memory-consuming and computation-intensive, challenging their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To tackle this limitation, prior works have explored ViT-tailored quantization algorithms but retained floating-point scaling factors, which yield nonnegligible requantization overhead, limiting ViTs’ hardware efficiency and motivating more hardware-friendly solutions. To this end, we propose P2-ViT, the first power-of-two (PoT) posttraining quantization (PTQ) and acceleration framework to accelerate fully quantized ViTs. Specifically, as for quantization, we explore a dedicated quantization scheme to effectively quantize ViTs with PoT scaling factors, thus minimizing the requantization overhead. Furthermore, we propose coarse-to-fine automatic mixed-precision quantization to enable better accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. In terms of hardware, we develop a dedicated chunk-based accelerator featuring multiple tailored subprocessors to individually handle ViTs’ different types of operations, alleviating reconfigurable overhead. In addition, we design a tailored row-stationary dataflow to seize the pipeline processing opportunity introduced by our PoT scaling factors, thereby enhancing throughput. Extensive experiments consistently validate P2-ViT’s effectiveness. Particularly, we offer comparable or even superior quantization performance with PoT scaling factors when compared with the counterpart with floating-point scaling factors. Besides, we achieve up to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$10.1\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> speedup and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$36.8\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> energy saving over GPU’s Turing Tensor Cores, and up to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.84\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> higher computation utilization efficiency against SOTA quantization-based ViT accelerators.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nResistance management in pesticide use is critical, yet grower practices, especially pesticide mixing motivations, diverge from theoretical frameworks. This study analyzes 30 years of Arizona cotton growers' practices and pest manager insights to understand mixing trends.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGrowers predominantly mix pesticides for spectrum or efficacy, not resistance management. This highlights a gap between theory and practice, emphasizing the complexity of real-world dynamics. A shift over time towards selective insecticides and integrated pest management (IPM), supported by extension education, has reduced reliance on broad-spectrum insecticides and increased opportunities to conserve the natural enemies of key pests. This reduced the frequency of insecticide use, a mutual goal of both IPM and resistance management. The availability and adoption of selective products with diverse modes of action, along with the resulting increases in biological control and refuges, likely has delayed or prevented resistances without emphasis on using mixtures specifically for resistance management. In a disrupted system exclusively dependent on broad-spectrum insecticides (1991-1995), 75% ± 5% of cotton area was sprayed with mixtures of these materials. With the availability of selective insecticides, few broad-spectrum products are used today and mixtures of insecticides are sprayed on only 36% ± 3% of the cotton area (2015-2020).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough mixing has theoretical relevance, it is diminishing in stable systems with diverse modes of action and adherence to moderation principles. Arizona cotton guidance prioritizes multi-crop refuges over mixtures for resistance management. Integrated research and education, targeting professional pest managers, are pivotal in advancing resistance management without mixtures specifically designed to prevent or mitigate resistance. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",

With the rapid development of agricultural intelligence, the accurate classification of cotton pests is a key factor in realizing the precise application of medicines by utilize unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), large application devices and other equipment. Methods In this study, a cotton insect pest classification model based on improved Swin Transformer is proposed. The model introduces the residual module, skip connection, into Swin Transformer to improve the problem that pest features are easily confused in complex backgrounds leading to poor classification accuracy, and to enhance the recognition of cotton pests. In this study, 2705 leaf images of cotton insect pests (including three insect pests, cotton aphids, cotton mirids and cotton leaf mites) were collected in the field, and after image preprocessing and data augmentation operations, model training was performed. Results The test results proved that the accuracy of the improved model compared to the original model increased from 94.6% to 97.4%, and the prediction time for a single image was 0.00434s. The improved Swin Transformer model was compared with seven kinds of classification models (VGG11, VGG11-bn, Resnet18, MobilenetV2, VIT, Swin Transformer small, and Swin Transformer base), and the model accuracy was increased respectively by 0.5%, 4.7%, 2.2%, 2.5%, 6.3%, 7.9%, 8.0%. Discussion Therefore, this study demonstrates that the improved Swin Transformer model significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of cotton pest detection compared with other classification models, and can be deployed on edge devices such as utilize unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), thus providing an important technological support and theoretical basis for cotton pest control and precision drug application.",

            "abstract": "Simple Summary Cotton is a crucial economic crop, but it is often threatened by various pests and diseases during its growth, significantly impacting its yield and quality. Earlier image classification methods often suffer from low accuracy and struggle to perform effectively in complex real-world environments. This paper proposes a novel image classification network named SpemNet, specifically designed for cotton pest and disease recognition. By introducing the Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (EMA) module and the Stacking Patch Embedding (SPE) module, the network enhances the ability to learn local features and integrate multi-scale information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of cotton pest and disease recognition. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available CottonInsect and IP102 datasets, as well as a self-collected cotton leaf disease dataset, demonstrate that SpemNet exhibits significant advantages in key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, confirming its effectiveness and superiority in the task of cotton pest and disease recognition. Abstract We propose a cotton pest and disease recognition method, SpemNet, based on efficient multi-scale attention and stacking patch embedding. By introducing the SPE module and the EMA module, we successfully solve the problems of local feature learning difficulty and insufficient multi-scale feature integration in the traditional Vision Transformer model, which significantly improve the performance and efficiency of the model. In our experiments, we comprehensively validate the SpemNet model on the CottonInsect dataset, and the results show that SpemNet performs well in the cotton pest recognition task, with significant effectiveness and superiority. The SpemNet model excels in key metrics such as precision and F1 score, demonstrating significant potential and superiority in the cotton pest and disease recognition task. This study provides an efficient and reliable solution in the field of cotton pest and disease identification, which is of great theoretical and applied significance.",

The LCDDN-YOLO algorithm is based on YOLOv8n, and replaces part of the convolutional layers in the backbone network with Distributed Shift Convolution (DSConv). The BiFPN network is incorporated into the original architecture, adding learnable weights to evaluate the significance of various input features, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Furthermore, it integrates Partial Convolution (PConv) and Distributed Shift Convolution (DSConv) into the C2f module, called PDS-C2f. Additionally, the CBAM attention mechanism is incorporated into the neck network to improve model performance. A Focal-EIoU loss function is also integrated to optimize the model’s training process. Experimental results show that compared to YOLOv8, the LCDDN-YOLO model reduces the number of parameters by 12.9% and the floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 9.9%, while precision, mAP@50, and recall improve by 4.6%, 6.5%, and 7.8%, respectively, reaching 89.5%, 85.4%, and 80.2%. In summary, the LCDDN-YOLO model offers excellent detection accuracy and speed, making it effective for pest and disease control in cotton fields, particularly in lightweight computing scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Background The Southern root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) poses a substantial threat to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) by causing significant agricultural losses. Host plant resistance is the most plausible approach for minimizing these losses. QTL mapping and early transcriptomic studies have identified candidate genes within the QTL regions on chromosome 11 (qMi-C11) and chromosome 14 (qMi-C14). Although these QTL regions have been fine-mapped and candidate genes identified, expression profiling of Meloidogyne-Gossypium interactions across different stages of infection could further refine the list of candidate genes. This study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance conferred by qMi-C11 and qMi-C14 against Southern root-knot nematode. Results Using time-course RNA-seq analyses across nematode developmental phases, we uncovered transcriptomic events—both genome-wide and within QTL intervals—underlying defense responses during compatible interactions (with Cocker 201, a susceptible line) and incompatible interactions (with M-120 RNR, a resistant line). Basal defense responses were observed in both compatible and incompatible interactions, with stronger expression in the incompatible interaction. Nematode-responsive genes associated with defense pathways showed distinct dynamics, characterized by repression during compatible interactions and early induction, greater diversity, and heightened upregulation during incompatible interactions. This study uncovers a broad repertoire of disease resistance and putative resistance genes, as well as pathogenesis-related genes, ligands, and receptors, that are differentially expressed in response to nematode parasitism. Mapping of these genes across the cotton genome identified promising candidates, including Gh_A11G3090 (PUB21) and Gh_A11G2836 (RPPL1) within the chromosome 11 QTL region, andGh_D02G0257 (RLP12) and Gh_D02G0259 (RLP12) within the chromosome 14 QTL region. Conclusions The findings of this study deepen our understanding of host-nematode interactions, identify candidate genes for downstream applications, and contribute to advancements in resistance breeding and sustainable nematode management strategies.

In the case of semantic segmentation, the literature lacks an efficient exit policy to stop the inference process earlier. Our contributions to fill this gap are twofold: (i) an adaptation of the normalized entropy (NE)-based exit criterion and (ii) a region-based exit criterion that compares segmentation from consecutive early exits. Our analyses reveal that the region-based approach better suits semantic segmentation because it exploits the intermediate early exits more efficiently. Our experiments show that a region-based EE-DNN delivers the same mean intersection over union as an EE-DNN with NE, saving at least 630 million floating-point operations per image on average.",

            "abstract": "With the advancement of representation learning, graph representation learning has gained significant attention in the field of community detection for heterogeneous networks. A prominent approach in this domain involves the use of meta-paths to capture higher-order relationships between nodes, particularly when bidirectional or reciprocal relationships exist. However, defining effective meta-paths often requires substantial domain expertise. Moreover, these methods typically depend on additional clustering algorithms, which can limit their practical applicability. To address these challenges, context paths have been introduced as an alternative to meta-paths. When combined with a self-attention mechanism, models can dynamically assess the relative importance of different context paths. By leveraging the inherent symmetry within context paths, models enhance their ability to capture balanced relationships between nodes, thereby improving their representation of complex interactions. Building on this idea, we propose BP-GCN, a self-attention-based model for heterogeneous community detection. BP-GCN autonomously identifies node relationships within symmetric context paths, significantly improving community detection accuracy. Furthermore, the model integrates the Bernoulli–Poisson framework to establish an end-to-end detection system that eliminates the need for auxiliary clustering algorithms. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that BP-GCN consistently outperforms existing benchmark methods.",

Timely applications of quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides have been suggested to manage this disease, but QoI resistance development is frequently detected for many fungal pathogens. In 2023, Ramulariopsis spp. isolates collected from Georgia were tested for species identification and for QoI resistance using molecular assays. Sequencing results revealed that all 6 isolates tested belong to R. pseudoglycines, confirming the presence of this species for the first time in Georgia. The partial amplification of the cytB gene showed that 83.3% of isolates had the G143A mutation, and no other amino acid substitution was observed.

This article systematically reviews research progress from three perspectives: technical frameworks, application scenarios, and sustainability-driven challenges. At the technical framework level, it outlines an integrated system encompassing data acquisition, feature fusion, and decision optimization, thereby covering the full pipeline of perception, analysis, and decision making essential for sustainable practices. Regarding application scenarios, it focuses on three major tasks—disease diagnosis, maturity and yield prediction, and weed identification—evaluating how deep learning-driven multisource data integration enhances precision and efficiency in sustainable farming operations. It further discusses the efficient translation of detection outcomes into eco-friendly field practices through agricultural navigation systems, harvesting and plant protection robots, and intelligent resource management strategies based on feedback-driven monitoring. In addressing challenges and future directions, the article highlights key bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity, real-time processing limitations, and insufficient model generalization, and proposes potential solutions including cross-modal generative models and federated learning to support more resilient, sustainable agricultural systems. This work offers a comprehensive three-dimensional analysis across technology, application, and sustainability challenges, providing theoretical insights and practical guidance for the intelligent and sustainable transformation of modern agriculture through multimodal fusion.",

To ensure food security worldwide, the minimization of food loss due to plant diseases is essential. Diagnosing the diseases at the right time is crucial for effectively treating plants. Usually, the farmers or plant scientists diagnose the diseases. They perform the diagnosis by visually inspecting the leaves or different parts of the plants. This task is time-consuming and requires experience. Sometimes this type of manual detection process becomes more difficult due to the number of plants and the similarity of the symptoms. To alleviate this process, an automated plant disease detection model is developed using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture of deep learning. The proposed model's computational expense and run-time are reasonably low. The model is validated using 2-D color images of potato leaves, including healthy and infected, collected from the PlantVillage dataset of the Kaggle public website. Test accuracy, the required number of parameters, and model run-time are considered to evaluate the model. The result is comparable to the state-of-the-art models to detect plant diseases with fewer resource requirements.",

Also, the world demand for potato is increasing significantly, primarily due to the world pandemic coronavirus. However, potato diseases are the leading cause of the decline in the quality and quantity of the harvest. Inappropriate classification and late detection of the disease's type will drastically worsen the plant conditions. Fortunately, several diseases in potato plants can be identified based on leaf conditions. Therefore, in this paper, we present a system to classify the four types of diseases in potato plants based on leaf conditions by utilising deep learning using the VGG16 and VGG19 convolutional neural network architecture model to obtain an accurate classification system. This experiment has achieved an average accuracy of 91%, which indicates the feasibility of the deep neural network approach.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification and various other computer vision tasks. Plant disease detection is an important area of deep learning which has been addressed by many recent methods. However, there is a dire need to optimize these solutions for resource-constrained portable devices such as smartphones. This is a challenging problem because deep learning models are resource extensive in nature. This paper proposes an efficient method to systematically classify plant disease symptoms using convolutional neural networks. These networks are memory efficient and when coupled with the proposed training configuration it enables rapid development of industrial applications by reducing the training times. Another critical problem arises with the improper distribution of samples among classes known as the class imbalance problem, which is addressed by employing a simple statistical methodology. Transfer learning is a known technique for training small datasets which transfers pre-trained weights learned on a large dataset. However, during transfer learning, negative transfer learning is a common problem. Therefore, a stepwise transfer learning approach is proposed which can help in fast convergence, while reducing overfitting and preventing negative transfer learning during knowledge transfer across domains. The system is trained and evaluated on two plant disease datasets i.e., PlantVillage (a publicly available dataset) and pepper disease dataset provided by the National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science, Republic of Korea. The pepper dataset is particularly challenging as it contains images from different parts of the plant such as the leaf, pulp, and stem. The proposed system has dominated the previous works on the PlantVillage dataset and achieved 99% and 99.69% accuracy on the Pepper dataset and PlantVillage datasets, respectively.",

Specifically, previous studies on plant image classification have used various plant datasets (fruits, vegetables, flowers, trees, etc., and their leaves). However, existing plant-based image datasets are generally small. Furthermore, there are limitations in the construction of large-scale datasets. Consequently, previous research on plant classification using small training datasets encountered difficulties in achieving high accuracy. However, research on plant image classification based on small training datasets is insufficient. Accordingly, this study performed classification by reducing the number of training images of plant-image datasets by 70%, 50%, 30%, and 10%, respectively. Then, the number of images was increased back through augmentation methods for training. This ultimately improved the plant-image classification performance. Based on the respective preliminary experimental results, this study proposed a plant-image classification convolutional neural network (PI-CNN) based on plant image augmentation using a plant-image generative adversarial network (PI-GAN). Our proposed method showed the higher classification accuracies compared to the state-of-the-art methods when the experiments were conducted using four open datasets of PlantVillage, PlantDoc, Fruits-360, and Plants.",

To construct video detection system for plant diseases and pests, and to build a real-time crop diseases and pests video detection system in the future, a deep learning-based video detection architecture with a custom backbone was proposed for detecting plant diseases and pests in videos. We first transformed the video into still frame, then sent the frame to the still-image detector for detection, and finally synthesized the frames into video. In the still-image detector, we used faster-RCNN as the framework. We used image-training models to detect relatively blurry videos. Additionally, a set of video-based evaluation metrics based on a machine learning classifier was proposed, which reflected the quality of video detection effectively in the experiments. Experiments showed that our system with the custom backbone was more suitable for detection of the untrained rice videos than VGG16, ResNet-50, ResNet-101 backbone system and YOLOv3 with our experimental environment.",

        "abstract": "Banana farming in Sri Lanka faces multifaceted challenges, including diseases, pests, and uncertainties in yield. This research introduces “Banana Buddy,” a comprehensive solution comprising two key components. The first employs deep learning and image processing to create a mobile application for accurate diagnosis of banana diseases and pests. Achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.1% for disease identification and 100% for pest attack detection, this tool provides timely, bilingual diagnoses in Sinhala and English, thereby enhancing disease management and crop health. The second component focuses on predicting suitable cultivation areas and recommending optimal banana varieties based on climate conditions. Leveraging advanced methodologies such as Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, alongside the Haversine formula, the system identifies optimal locations and suggests banana varieties, achieving superior accuracy. The XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers outperformed other algorithms in predicting suitable cultivation areas. Integrating these components into a user-friendly mobile app addresses the challenges faced by Sri Lankan banana farmers. By harnessing technology and data-driven insights, this initiative empowers farmers to make informed decisions, manage diseases, and optimize cultivation practices. The exceptional accuracy values in disease and pest identification, coupled with the superior performance of machine learning models, underscore the practicality and effectiveness of the approach. Looking ahead, future work includes expanding disease identification capabilities and incorporating additional banana varieties. Furthermore, introducing parameters like humidity and wind speed will enhance the system's accuracy. In conclusion, this research represents a significant advancement in banana farming practices, providing a valuable tool for farmers to navigate challenges and cultivate bananas sustainably. The findings hold promise for broader applications, benefiting not only Sri Lankan farmers but also contributing to global agricultural advancements.",

Our approach applies the joint bilateral filter to transfer the textural structures of HR RGB image to low-resolution HS image and obtain an enhanced HS image. Initial experimental results on Musa acuminata (banana) leaf images demonstrate the efficiency of our fusion approach, with significant improvements over either single data source or some conventional methods.",

The quick determination of these diseases, allows the production to be more efficient. In the present study, because of the current situation, it was chosen to take images from a free online repository. Convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented to detect banana plant diseases from banana leaf RGB images. The development of 3 models was considered: The first one without regularization, the second one with Dropout and the last one with weight regularization. K-fold cross-validation method was used for hyperparameters tuning, Adam optimizer was used to accelerate neural network (NN) training. Also, metrics as accuracy and F1-Score were used to evaluate the NN performance. In the process, a total of 27 hyperparameter configurations were formed for each kind of model, from which the best configuration was chosen. Based on the results, it was concluded that CNN without any regularization technique was more effective for predicting banana plant diseases than the other models, despite having few data.",

Crop protection is remaining as a crucial factor in agriculture, since it determines the quantity and quality of products and increases the profit of the farmers. In the Indian economy, plantain tree cultivation is playing a major role. Plantain Tree is highly exposed to diseases such as Black Sigatoka/Yellow Sigatoka, Panama, Bunchy top, Moko, chlorosis, etc. This study aims at developing a DL model to facilitate crop protection by accurately identifying the diseases that affect the productivity of plantain trees by using the leaf images. The pre-processing of image data will also help to improve the classification accuracy and training time. The main aim of this study is the research investigation and performance comparison of various data augmentation and feature selection techniques that helps in the classification and detection of diseases in plantain trees. The experiments are carried out in real-time datasets, which are collected from different plantain tree cultivation in different fields of Tamil Nadu. The experimental results reveal the necessity to propose effective preprocessing techniques for improving the accuracy of the classification models.",

However, global banana production is severely affected by diseases, leading to substantial declination in the yield. Hence, timely detection and control of these diseases is necessary. Diagnosis of diseases by manual inspection of initial symptoms is quite challenging for farmers. This paper demonstrates a novel machine learning approach towards classification of three major foliar fungal diseases, Sigatoka, Deightoneilla and Cordana, using discoloration patterns appearing on the leaf blade. The images, after pre-processing and segmentation, are transformed to frequency domain using discrete orthonormal Stockwell transform (DOST). Feature vectors based on local neighborhood patterns such as local binary pattern (LBP), elliptic LBP (ELBP) and its variants, are extracted from DOST transformed images and classified using five prominent image classifiers. A comparative analysis of performance metrics through a ten-fold cross validation procedure is done. Classification accuracy of 95.9% is obtained for ELBP features when classified with artificial neural network classifier (ANN). The technique of integrating DOST with LBP based features has achieved significant accuracy compared to contemporary methods of disease classification in plants.",

According to related statics, over 60% of the total earth\npopulation mainly depend on agriculture’s sources for their\nprimary feed. Unfortunately, one of the disaster problems that\naffect badly on agriculture production is plant diseases. There are\nabout 25% of agriculture production lost annually because of\nplant diseases. Late and Early Blight diseases are one of the most\ndestructive diseases that infect potato crop. Although, the late and\ninaccurate detection of plant diseases increases the losing\npercentage for the crop. The main approach of our proposed\nsystem is to detect early the plant diseases to decrease the plant’s\nproduction losses by using a diagnosis and detection system based\non the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). We used CNN to\nextract the diseases features from the input images of the\nsupported training dataset for classification purposes. For model\ntraining, 1700 of potato leaf images were used, then the testing\nprocess is done by using approximately 300 images and 100\nimages for fine tuning and parameters calibration against any\nbiased data.

The system generates hourly or daily warnings at the spatial resolution of based on weather data. The system consists of four components including weather data acquisition system, job process system, data storage system, and web service system. The spatial resolution of disease forecast is high enough to estimate daily or hourly infection risks of individual farms, so that farmers can use the forecast information practically in determining if and when fungicides are to be sprayed to control diseases. Currently, forecasting models for blast, sheath blight, and grain rot of rice, and scab and rust of pear are available for the system. As for the spatial interpolation of weather data, the interpolated temperature and relative humidity showed high accuracy as compared with the observed data at the same locations. However, the spatial interpolation of rainfall and leaf wetness events needs to be improved. For rice blast forecasting, 44.5% of infection warnings based on the observed weather data were correctly estimated when the disease forecast was made based on the interpolated weather data. The low accuracy in disease forecast based on the interpolated weather data was mainly due to the failure in estimating leaf wetness events.",

Este trabalho apresenta uma revisao sobre os meios pelos quais as variaveis meteorologicas sao coletadas para serem usadas como dados de entrada em sistemas de alerta fitossanitario e sobre os desafios associados a logistica de obtencao desses dados. Essa revisao compara o monitoramento meteorologico ao nivel do produtor, nas propriedades agricolas, com aquele feito ao nivel de redes de estacoes meteorologicas, assim como discute as vantagens e desvantagens entre medir e estimar tais variaveis meteorologicas. Especial enfase e dada a duracao do periodo de molhamento foliar (DPM), nao somente pela sua importância como dado de entrada em diversos sistemas de alerta fitossanitario, mas tambem pelo desafio de se obter dados acurados dessa variavel. Pode-se concluir, apos ampla discussao do assunto, que nao ha um metodo unico e melhor para se obter os dados meteorologicos para uso em sistemas de alerta fitossanitario; por outro lado, as circunstâncias a nivel local, regional e nacional provavelmente influenciam a estrategia de maior sucesso.",

        "abstract": "Agriculture is the main source of the Andhra Pradesh state economy. The agriculture industry heavily depends on crop production. But, many of the plants suffer from several diseases. Contaminated crops are mostly to blame for food loss, which consequently slows down the development of the agricultural industry. Recently in 2022, Both AP & Telangana face 40-80% of damage to chili crops due to pest attacks also informed in Parliament. It is very challenging for farmers to identify diseases in plants at the beginning stages. The assembly of the product and the market's economic value will be severely harmed by erroneous identification. There are many existing solutions to this problem associated with a mobile phones. But most of them are limited to the detection of plant diseases with a smaller number of categories of plants. The goal of this system is to detect plant diseases from images of the plant's leaves by developing a mobile application for the Andhra Pradesh state region, which will assist farmers in using appropriate pesticides for that disease. This involves the detection of plant disease based on the classification of leaf images using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. So, farmers can easily detect plant diseases in the early stages and use pesticides to treat those plants, which helps gain the economy. The dataset is the PlantVillage dataset under Kaggle which contains leaf images of various plants. The model is enhanced by hashing using the SHA-256 algorithm. The input data to the hash function is a leaf image which is in bytes format. The proposed model achieves integrity by using SHA-256. This model allows the identification of plant diseases that are tamper-proof.",

In recent years, with the advantages of automatic learning and feature extraction, it has been widely concerned by academic and industrial circles. It has been widely used in image and video processing, voice processing, and natural language processing. At the same time, it has also become a research hotspot in the field of agricultural plant protection, such as plant disease recognition and pest range assessment, etc. The application of deep learning in plant disease recognition can avoid the disadvantages caused by artificial selection of disease spot features, make plant disease feature extraction more objective, and improve the research efficiency and technology transformation speed. This review provides the research progress of deep learning technology in the field of crop leaf disease identification in recent years. In this paper, we present the current trends and challenges for the detection of plant leaf disease using deep learning and advanced imaging techniques. We hope that this work will be a valuable resource for researchers who study the detection of plant diseases and insect pests.

Deep learning methods have recently obtained promising results in a number of artificial intelligence issues, leading us to apply them to the challenge of recognizing citrus fruit and leaf diseases. In this paper, an integrated approach is used to suggest a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) model. The proposed CNN model is intended to differentiate healthy fruits and leaves from fruits/leaves with common citrus diseases such as black spot, canker, scab, greening, and Melanose. The proposed CNN model extracts complementary discriminative features by integrating multiple layers. The CNN model was checked against many state-of-the-art deep learning models on the Citrus and PlantVillage datasets. According to the experimental results, the CNN Model outperforms the competitors in a variety of measurement metrics. The CNN Model has a test accuracy of 94.55 percent, making it a valuable decision support tool for farmers looking to classify citrus fruit/leaf diseases.",

In this connection, the emergence of deep learning-based image classification has introduced a substantial number of solutions. However, the applicability of these solutions in low-end devices requires fast, accurate, and computationally inexpensive systems. This work proposes a lightweight transfer learning-based approach for detecting diseases from tomato leaves. It utilizes an effective preprocessing method to enhance the leaf images with illumination correction for improved classification. Our system extracts features using a combined model consisting of a pretrained MobileNetV2 architecture and a classifier network for effective prediction. Traditional augmentation approaches are replaced by runtime augmentation to avoid data leakage and address the class imbalance issue. Evaluation on tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset shows that the proposed architecture achieves 99.30% accuracy with a model size of 9.60MB and 4.87M floating-point operations, making it a suitable choice for low-end devices. Our codes and models will be made available upon publication.",

This paper discusses about a deep learning approach to detect the ships from satellite imagery. The model developed in this work achieves integrity by the inclusion of hashing. This model employs a supervised image classification technique to classify images, followed by object detection using You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3) to extract features from deep CNN. Semantic segmentation and image segmentation is done to identify object category of each pixel using class labels. Then, the concept of hashing using SHA-256 is applied in conjunction with the ship count and location of bounding box in satellite image. The proposed model is tested on a Kaggle Ships dataset, which consists of 231,722 images. A total of 70% of this data is used for training, and the 30% is used for testing. To add security to images with detected ships, the model is enhanced by hashing using SHA-256 algorithm. Using SHA-256, which is a one-way hash, the data are split up into blocks of 64 bytes. The input data to the hash function are both the ship count and bounding box location. The proposed model achieves integrity by using SHA-256. This model allows secure transmission of highly confidential images that are tamper-proof.",

            "abstract": "Plant diseases compose a great threat to global food security. However, the rapid identification of plant diseases remains challenging and time-consuming. It requires experts to accurately identify if the plant is healthy or not and identify the type of infection. Deep learning techniques have recently been used to identify and diagnose diseased plants from digital images to help automate plant disease diagnosis and help non-experts identify diseased plants. While many deep learning applications have been used to identify diseased plants and aims to increase the detection rate, the limitation of the large parameter size in the models persist. In this paper, an end-to-end deep learning model is developed to identify healthy and unhealthy corn plant leaves while taking into consideration the number of parameters of the model. The proposed model utilizes two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), EfficientNetB0, and DenseNet121, to extract deep features from the corn plant images.The deep features extracted from each CNN are then fused using the concatenation technique to produce a more complex feature set from which the model can learn better about the dataset. In this paper, data augmentation techniques were used to add variations to the images in the dataset used to train the model, increasing the variety and number of the images and enabling the model to learn more complex cases of the data. The obtained result of this work is compared with other pre-trained CNN models, namely ResNet152 and InceptionV3, which have a larger number of parameters than the proposed model and require more processing power. The proposed model is able to achieve a classification accuracy of 98.56% which shows the superiority of the proposed model over ResNet152 and InceptionV3 that achieved a classification accuracy of 98.37% and 96.26% respectively.",

        "abstract": "The agricultural sector plays a key role in supplying quality food and makes the greatest contribution to growing economies and populations. Plant disease may cause significant losses in food production and eradicate diversity in species. Early diagnosis of plant diseases using accurate or automatic detection techniques can enhance the quality of food production and minimize economic losses. In recent years, deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in the recognition accuracy of image classification and object detection systems. Hence, in this paper, we utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pre-trained models for efficient plant disease identification. We focused on fine tuning the hyperparameters of popular pre-trained models, such as DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4. The experiments were carried out using the popular PlantVillage dataset, which has 54,305 image samples of different plant disease species in 38 classes. The performance of the model was evaluated through classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. A comparative analysis was also performed with similar state-of-the-art studies. The experiments proved that DenseNet-121 achieved 99.81% higher classification accuracy, which was superior to state-of-the-art models.",

            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections&#x2014;one between each layer and its subsequent layer&#x2014;our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less memory and computation to achieve high performance.

            "abstract": "Abstract. Early and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases is a vital step in the crop protection system. In traditional practices, identification is performed either by visual observation or by testing in laboratory. The visual observation requires expertise and it may vary subject to an individual which may lead to an error while the laboratory test is time consuming and may not be able to provide the results in time. To overcome these issues, image based machine learning approach to detect and classify plant diseases has been presented in literature. We have focused specifically on rice plant (Oryza sativa) disease in this paper. The images of the diseased symptoms in leaves and stems have been captured from the rice field. We have collected a total of 619 rice plant diseased images from the real field condition belong to four classes:(a) Rice Blast (RB), (b) Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB), (c) Sheat Blight (SB) and (d) Healthy Leave (HL). We have used a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network(CNN) as a feature extractor and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. We have obtained encouraging results. The early identification of rice diseases by this approach could be used as a preventive measure well as an early warning system. Further, it could be extended to develop a rice plant disease identification system on real agriculture field.\n",

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",

To improve the detection accuracy of corn leaf diseases, a CNN model has been approached. The improved CNN model is used for training and testing four kinds of corn leaf images are achieved by adding rectified linear unit activation functions and adam optimizer, by adjusting the parameters, pooling operations and reducing the number of classifiers. During the detection of three types of corn leaf diseases, this model achieves 98.78% of average detection accuracy which is the highest accuracy achieved only for corn disease detection from leaves with shorter training convergence times to the best of our consideration. Overall, this approach is advantageous and short time consuming and provides a dynamic way of detecting corn disease of the leaf. This will be beneficial for poor farmers from crop loss and lead our nation to support the digital agricultural system.",

            "abstract": "Diagnosing the plant disease is crucial from the perspective of agriculture, as diseases often limit plants’ production capacity. However, manual approaches to recognize plant diseases are often temporal, challenging, and time-consuming. Therefore, computerized recognition of plant diseases is highly desired in the field of agricultural automation. Due to the recent improvement of computer vision, identifying diseases using leaf images of a particular plant has already been introduced. Nevertheless, most of the introduced models can only diagnose diseases of a specific plant. Hence, in this chapter, we investigate an optimal plant disease identification model combining the diagnosis of multiple plants. Despite relying on multi-class classification, the model inherits a multi-label classification method to identify the plant and the type of disease in parallel. For the experiment and evaluation, we have collected data from various online sources that included leaf images of six plants, including tomato, potato, rice, corn, grape, and apple. In our investigation, we implement numerous popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The experimental results validate that the Xception as well as DenseNet architectures perform better in multi-label plant disease classification tasks. Besides, we have found that a CNN architecture, the skip connections, spatial convolutions, and shorter hidden layer connectivity influence on better results in plant disease classification.",

But these days getting proper yield of crops is a tough task as they are affected with some diseases during their growth and sometimes it remains unnoticed by the farmer and this in turn results in the un-proper yield of crops. This paper focuses upon detection of such diseases which occur on a paddy crop using the concept of artificial intelligence and CNN. The diseases encountered by a paddy crop is stored in the database i.e., raspberry pi and when the farmer clicks the photo of the crop, the pi analyzes that picture and compares with the database pictures using the concepts of convolutional neural network and artificial intelligence and thus depicts the output whether the crop is affected with a particular or not and thus finally alerts the farmer about the disease.",

To minimize the loss, deep learning techniques are utilized to detect leaf infection and have wildly outperformed the traditional method of manual detection. However, deploying such models is a challenge since devices in the field normally have limited resources and low computational power while large datasets have to be used. Therefore, in this paper, we benchmark the most popular deep learning models for multi-leaf disease detection to gauge which model is the most suitable for real deployment. Using a real-world large-scale dataset from PlantVillage and a Raspberry Pi 3, we found that MobileNet V3 provides a reliable accuracy of 96.58%, small Inference/Initialization time of 127 ms and 11 ms respectively, requires only 7.4 MB of memory in total, and hence the most appropriate choice for a real farm.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have approached the identification of foliar plant diseases using artificial intelligence, but in these works, classification is achieved using only one side of the leaf. Phytopathology specifies that there are diseases that show similar symptoms on the upper part of the leaf, but different ones on the lower side. An improvement in accuracy can be achieved if the symptoms of both sides of the leaf are considered when classifying plant diseases. In this context, it is necessary to establish whether the captured image represents the leaf on its upper or lower side. From the research conducted using botany books, we can conclude that a useful classification feature is color, because the sun-facing part is greener, while the opposite side is shaded. A second feature is the thickness of the primary and secondary veins. The veins of a leaf are more prominent on the lower side, compared to the upper side. A third feature corresponds to the concave shape of the leaf on its upper part and its convex shape on the lower part. In this study, we aim to achieve upper and lower leaf side classification using both deep learning methods and machine learning models.",

        "title": "Optimizing Leaf Disease Detection in Agriculture using Deep Learning",
        "abstract": "The agricultural industry is crucial for providing high-quality food and significantly contributes to the growth of both economies and populations. However, plant diseases can lead to substantial losses in food production and reduce species diversity. By utilizing precise and automated recognition methods, timely diagnosis of plant diseases can increase food production quality and decrease economic losses. Recently, deep learning has greatly advanced the accuracy of image classification and object detection systems, enhancing their effectiveness. Agriculture is the backbone of any country’s economy and is vital for the people’s survival. To ensure high crop production efficiency, it is essential to prevent plant diseases. For this study we considered a dataset with total of 15 classes which includes both healthy and diseases classes of leaves of total 6 categories i.e Apple healthy, Apple cedar rust, Apple scab, Potato early blight, Potato late blight, Tomato Early blight, Tomato Late blight, Grape healthy, Grape black rot, Corn (maize) rust, Corn (maize) healthy, Cherry healthy, Cherry powdery mildew. The Dense Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is employed for classification. In this paper, a pre-trained neural network model, DenseNet-121 is applied on the dataset. The dataset is trained by freezing layers in the DenseNet architecture to increase the time complexity. The proposal aims to optimize resource information to improve outcomes without added complexity. This results a model with 99.2% accuracy and 0.3% loss. Fine-tuning layers were added to the DenseNet-121 model for achievement of enhanced and higher results.",

            "abstract": ": The deep neural network-based method requires a lot of data for training. Aiming at the problem of a lack of training images in tomato leaf disease identiﬁcation, an Adversarial-VAE network model for generating images of 10 tomato leaf diseases is proposed, which is used to expand the training set for training an identiﬁcation model. First, an Adversarial-VAE model is designed to generate tomato leaf disease images. Then, a multi-scale residual learning module is used to replace single-size convolution kernels to enrich extracted features, and a dense connection strategy is integrated into the Adversarial-VAE networks to further enhance the image generation ability. The training set is expanded by the proposed model, which generates the same number of images by training 10,892 images of 10 leaves. The generated images are superior to those of InfoGAN, WAE, VAE, and VAE-GAN measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). The experimental results show that using the extension dataset that is generated by the Adversarial-VAE model to train the Resnet identiﬁcation model could improve the accuracy of identiﬁcation effectively. The model proposed in this paper could generate enough images of tomato leaf diseases and provide a feasible solution for data expansion of tomato leaf disease images.",

In consideration of the growing demand for sustainable agriculture and food security, the timely identification and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases have become essential. Modern deep learning techniques provide exciting opportunities for automated disease classification, which may greatly help farmers and agricultural professionals. The primary goal of this research is to develop an effective deep neural network model that accurately categorizes various diseases affecting maize leaves through the use of image data. We employed four different models, namely Simple ResNet-50, Binary ResNet-50, Otsu Threshold, and U2 Net and CNN with segmentation, utilising CNNs to improve the precision of classification. The dataset contained images of maize leaves showing various diseases. We used three classification techniques to analyse the images. Each of these methods aimed to effectively differentiate the affected areas in leaf images, thus enhancing the model’s performance. The classification phase consisted of training and testing CNN and ResNet-50 models multiple times (50, 100, and 150) using two different data splits (70-30 and 80-20). The evaluation of these models was based on metrics such as test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification and various other computer vision tasks. Plant disease detection is an important area of deep learning which has been addressed by many recent methods. However, there is a dire need to optimize these solutions for resource-constrained portable devices such as smartphones. This is a challenging problem because deep learning models are resource extensive in nature. This paper proposes an efficient method to systematically classify plant disease symptoms using convolutional neural networks. These networks are memory efficient and when coupled with the proposed training configuration it enables rapid development of industrial applications by reducing the training times. Another critical problem arises with the improper distribution of samples among classes known as the class imbalance problem, which is addressed by employing a simple statistical methodology. Transfer learning is a known technique for training small datasets which transfers pre-trained weights learned on a large dataset. However, during transfer learning, negative transfer learning is a common problem. Therefore, a stepwise transfer learning approach is proposed which can help in fast convergence, while reducing overfitting and preventing negative transfer learning during knowledge transfer across domains. The system is trained and evaluated on two plant disease datasets i.e., PlantVillage (a publicly available dataset) and pepper disease dataset provided by the National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science, Republic of Korea. The pepper dataset is particularly challenging as it contains images from different parts of the plant such as the leaf, pulp, and stem. The proposed system has dominated the previous works on the PlantVillage dataset and achieved 99% and 99.69% accuracy on the Pepper dataset and PlantVillage datasets, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In agriculture farming, pests and other plant diseases are the most imperative factor that causes significant hindrance to cucumber production and its quality. Farmers around the globe are currently facing difficulty in recognizing various cucumber leaf diseases, which is imperative to preventing leaf diseases effectively. Manual techniques to diagnose cucumber diseases are often time-consuming, subjective, and laborious. To address this issue, this paper proposes a tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to recognise five cucumber diseases and healthy leaves that comprises image enhancement, feature extraction, and classification. Data augmentation methods were utilized as a preprocessing step to enlarge the datasets, and it was also to decrease the chance of overfitting. Automatically features are extracted by using CNN layers. Finally, five cucumber leaf diseases and one healthy leaf are classified. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of a public dataset, a new dataset of cucumber leaf diseases has been constructed that includes spider, leaf miner, downy mildew, powdery mildew, one viral disease, and healthy class leaves. The dataset has a total of 4868 cucumber leaf images. In order to prove the authenticity of the proposed CNN, comparative experiments were conducted using pretrained models (AlexNet, Inception-V3, and ResNet-50). The proposed CNN achieves a recognition accuracy of 98.19% with the augmented dataset and 100% with the publicly plant disease dataset. The experimental results confirm that the proposed CNN algorithm was efficient for recognizing the cucumber leaf diseases compared with other algorithms.",

While several studies utilizing machine learning techniques have been conducted, significant issues remain in most cases where the dataset is not composed of field images and often includes a substantial number of inappropriate labels. In this paper, we propose a practical automated plant diagnosis system. We first build a highly reliable dataset by cultivating plants in a strictly controlled setting.  We then develop a robust classifier capable of analyzing a wide variety of field images. We use a total of 9,000 original cucumber field leaf images to identify seven typical viral diseases, Downy mildew and healthy plants including initial symptoms. We also visualize the key regions of diagnostic evidence. Our system attains 93.6% average accuracy, and we confirm that our system captures important features for the diagnosis of Downy mildew.  ",

However, all of the systems were designed to diagnose single infections, thus they do not assume multiple infections. In this paper, we created our original on-site cucumber leaf dataset including multiple infections to build a practical plant diagnosis system. Our dataset has a total of 48,311 cucumber leaf images (38,821 leaves infected with any of 11 kinds of diseases, 1,814 leaves infected with multiple diseases, and 7,676 healthy leaves). We developed a convolutional neural networks (CNN) classifier having the sigmoid function with a tunable threshold on each node in the last output layer. Our model attained on average a 95.5% classification accuracy on the entire dataset. On only multiple infected cases, the result was 85.9% and it accurately identified at least one disease in 1,808 out of the total of 1,814 (99.7%).",

Modern convolutional neural network architecture like this kind have become known for being efficient and scalable. Rice, being a staple food for a significant portion of the global population, faces numerous threats from pests and diseases, making early and accurate disease detection crucial for ensuring food security. We employed Efficient Net due to its adaptive scaling of depth, width, and resolution, which significantly enhances model performance on limited datasets. Our methodology involved implementation of a dataset of rice plant images labeled with various health conditions such as ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy.’ The Efficient Net model was used to classify these conditions accurately after sufficient training. Proposed model results are with other prevalent models in plant disease classification, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, across multiple validation metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score. The proposed system achieves Precision of 94.4%, Recall of 92.9%, and 95.11% of F1 score which outperformed the other existing models.",

This work aims to review air-pollution research to understand its impacts on the agricultural community and yield crops, specifically in developing countries, such as India. The present work highlights various aspects of agricultural damage caused by the impacts of air pollution. Furthermore, in the undertaken study, a rigorous and detailed discussion of state-wise and city-wise yield-crop losses caused by air pollution in India and its impacts has been performed. To represent air-pollution impacts, the color-coding-based AQI (Air Quality Index) risk-classification metrics have been used to represent AQI variations in India’s agrarian states and cities. Finally, recent impacts of air pollution concerning AQI variations for May 2019 to February 2020, Seasonal AQI variations, impacts of PM2.5, and PM10 in various agrarian states and India cities are presented using various tabular and graphical representations.",

Correspondingly, the real-time solar and load data are collected from the data port for the city of Austin. A single day is selected for our analysis of all four seasons of the year. The flat rate, and real-time and day-ahead pricing information are collected from ComEd. The key challenge for addressing business problems is the flexibility of consumption. However, without considering the properties of loss aversion, the system would not be a practical solution. So, in this article, a dynamic demand response program based on price elasticity that integrates loss aversion characteristics is proposed. The proposed system is compared for all pricing schemes and all seasons. Four scenarios are created for peak time rebate with different combinations of loss aversion factor values and all the possible combinations of rebates. This article directs how these combinations could change the demand curve and how the utility can make a decision about the specific importance of the criteria, such as the total demand carrying capacity, peak demand reduction, and in obtaining optimum profit for utility and the consumer.",

In addition, it produces hazardous gasses and high environmental pollution. So, in this work, the solar natural source is selected for generating the electricity. Due to the nonlinear behavior of PV, achieving maximum voltage from the Photovoltaic (PV) system is a more tough job. In this work, various hybrid optimization controllers are studied for tracing the working power point of the PV under different Partial Shading Conditions. The studied hybrid optimization MPPT methods are equated in terms of oscillations across MPP, output power extraction, settling time of the MPP, dependency on the PV modeling, operating duty value of the converter, error finding accuracy of MPPT, algorithm complexity, tracking speed, periodic tuning required, and the number of sensing parameters utilized. Based on the simulative comparison results, it has been observed that the modified Grey Wolf Optimization based ANFIS hybrid MPPT method provides good results when equated with the other power point tracking techniques. Here, the conventional converter helps increase the PV source voltage from one level to another level. The proposed system is investigated by using the MATLAB/Simulink tool.",

        "abstract": "Agriculture, which is the foundation of worldwide sustenance, is facing substantial obstacles in the twenty-first century, mainly because of increasing demands for food production and the growing menace of plant diseases. Ensuring the well-being of crops is of utmost importance for the security of global food supply, which requires the timely and precise detection of plant diseases. Conventional approaches are becoming less effective in dealing with the changing agricultural dangers, necessitating the development of new and creative solutions. The incorporation of machine learning and deep learning technologies in recent agricultural practices has significantly transformed plant disease diagnosis, providing remarkable levels of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. This study utilises advanced algorithms such as ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet to improve the accuracy of disease identification, thereby revolutionising precision agriculture. The main objective of this article is to enhance the process of plant disease detection with the help of a sophisticated model, VisonaryX-9, that can not only properly identify plant diseases but also classify their symptoms. The objective is to empower farmers by furnishing them with timely information, enabling informed decisions that directly influence agricultural output and, consequently, global food production. Our contributions consist of the creation of VisonaryX-9, a hybrid model that merges the ResNet and VGG architectures. The model is validated with a dataset of having 87,295 real-world plant disease images. The results obtained indicates the the model outperforms other baseline model with an accuracy of 99.12%. Our objective is to reveal profound understandings that will enhance the discussion on sustainable and resilient farming methodologies.",

A new dataset was created using various open datasets. Data augmentation techniques were used to balance the individual class sizes of the dataset. Three image augmentation techniques were used: basic image manipulation (BIM), deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and neural style transfer (NST). The dataset consists of 147,500 images of 58 different healthy and diseased plant leaf classes and one no-leaf class. The proposed DCNN model was trained in the multi-graphics processing units (MGPUs) environment for 1000 epochs. The random search with the coarse-to-fine searching technique was used to select the most suitable hyperparameter values to improve the training performance of the proposed DCNN model. On the 8850 test images, the proposed DCNN model achieved 99.9655% overall classification accuracy, 99.7999% weighted average precision, 99.7966% weighted average recall, and 99.7968% weighted average F1 score. Additionally, the overall performance of the proposed DCNN model was better than the existing transfer learning approaches.",

The fatality rate of plants can be reduced by diagnosing them for any signs early on. The early detection of such diseases is one possibility for lowering plant mortality rates. Machine learning (ML), a type of artificial intelligence technology that allows researchers to enhance and develop without being explicitly programmed, is used in this study to build early prediction models for plant disease diagnosis. Due to the similarities of crops throughout the early phonological phases, crop classification has proved problematic. ML can be applied to a variety of tasks recognize different types of crops at low altitude platforms with the help of drones that provide high‐resolution optical imagery. The drones are employed to photograph phonological stages, and these greyscale photographs are then utilized to develop grey level co‐occurrence matrices‐based characteristics. In this article, the proposed plant disease detection models are developed using ML approaches such as random forest‐nearest neighbours, linear regression, Naive Bayes, neural networks, and support vector machine. The performance of the generated plants disease risk evaluation model is calculated using unbiased metrics such as true positive rate, true negative rate, precision, recall, and F1‐score method are all factors to consider. The results revealed that the ensemble plants disease model outperforms the other proposed and developed plant disease detection models. The proposed and developed plant disease prediction models aimed to predict disease detection in the early stages, allowing for early preventive actions and predictive maintenance.",

A first step in eliminating and treating infections to avoid crop damage is recognizing ailments on Arabica coffee leaves. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are rapidly advancing, making it possible to diagnose Arabica coffee leaf damage without a specialist's help. CNN is aimed to find features adaptively through backpropagation by adding layers including convolutional layers and pooling layers. This study aims to optimize and increase the accuracy of Arabica coffee leaf disease classification utilizing the neural network architectures: ResNet50, InceptionResNetV4, MobileNetV2, and DensNet169. Additionally, this research presents an interactive web platform integrated with the Arabica coffee leaf disease prediction system. Inside this research, 5000 image data points will be divided into five classes—Phoma, Rust, Cescospora, healthy, and Miner—to assess the efficacy of CNN architecture in classifying images of Arabica coffee leaf disease. 80:10:10 is the ratio between training data, validation, and testing. In the testing findings, the InceptionResnetV2 and DensNet169 designs had the highest accuracy, at 100%, followed by the MobileNetV2 architecture at 99% and the ResNet50 architecture at 59%. Even though MobileNetV2 is not more accurate than InceptionResnetV2 and DensNet169, MobileNetV2 is the smallest of the three models. The MobileNetV2 paradigm was chosen for web application development. The system accurately identified and advised treatment for Arabica coffee leaf diseases, as shown by the system's implementation outcomes. \n ",

        "abstract": "The application of Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) has significantly improved the processing of images in the past few years over traditional approaches. With the ever-growing world population and increased demand for food, global food production depends heavily on plants. Plant diseases are caused by a variety of environmental variables, which significantly reduce productivity. This poses an urgent threat to food security, yet in several parts of the world, it is still challenging to quickly identify them. Traditional methods of detecting and preventing the spread of plant disease have become less efficient, inaccurate, and time-intensive, thus an automated and reliable approach to detecting these diseases is imperative. By enabling early detection of plant diseases, adopting cutting-edge technologies like ML and DL can assist in overcoming these difficulties. This study aimed to design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting diseases in plants using publicly available plant leaf datasets obtained from Kaggle. The datasets contain Tomato, Potato, and Pepper bell leaves that are diseased and healthy. The efficacy of the model was assessed utilising precision, recall, and F1 score. CNN had an accuracy of 94%. Thus, the detection and proper diagnosis of plant disease is principal for successful plant growth and this reduces the threats it poses to food security in the world. It is recommended that the proposed deep learning model be translated into a system suitable for plant disease detection.",

        "abstract": "Plant diseases are posing an increasing danger to the global food supply, which indicates that we truly need more precise and advanced methods of disease detection. This work aims to address this issue by use of cutting edge deep learning technologies. The paper examines how effectively various models identify plant diseases. Among the models it examines are VGG13, Squeezenet1_1, ResNet34, Inception_ v3, and DenseNet169. Information utilized includes a baseline class from the DAGS dataset and 38 distinct plant diseases from the PlantVillage dataset that was taken from Kaggle. The findings indicate that various designs and training methods function somewhat differently. AlexNet, for instance, reaches 99.24% accuracy after extensive retraining. When DenseNet169 is deep retrained, however, it does incredibly well, achieving 99.72% accuracy. To better comprehend the behavior of the models, the study involves visualization experiments in addition to accuracy measurements. Heat maps that graphically illustrate how various aspects of a picture impact the choices the computer program makes are displayed in the occlusion experiment. The saliency map experiment determines the most significant pixels using mathematical means. This clarifies the ways in which the model draws judgments. With AlexNet and VGG13, images of several plant diseases like Early Blight, Late Blight, and Septoria Leaf Spot are displayed. In conclusion, this paper presents key details concerning the operation of many deep learning models for identifying plant diseases. The outcomes facilitate the selection of the optimal models and training programs, therefore enhancing the development of reliable and robust automated systems for plant disease diagnosis. Using the newest technologies, this research is a crucial first step in introducing sophisticated disease detection to agriculture.",

Pneumonia shares visual features with other respiratory diseases, such as tuberculosis, which can make it difficult to distinguish between them. Moreover, there is significant variability in the way chest X-ray images are acquired and processed, which can impact the quality and consistency of the images. This can make it challenging to develop robust algorithms that can accurately identify pneumonia in all types of images. Hence, there is a need to develop robust, data-driven algorithms that are trained on large, high-quality datasets and validated using a range of imaging techniques and expert radiological analysis. In this research, a deep-learning-based model is demonstrated for differentiating between normal and severe cases of pneumonia. This complete proposed system has a total of eight pre-trained models, namely, ResNet50, ResNet152V2, DenseNet121, DenseNet201, Xception, VGG16, EfficientNet, and MobileNet. These eight pre-trained models were simulated on two datasets having 5856 images and 112,120 images of chest X-rays. The best accuracy is obtained on the MobileNet model with values of 94.23% and 93.75% on two different datasets. Key hyperparameters including batch sizes, number of epochs, and different optimizers have all been considered during comparative interpretation of these models to determine the most appropriate model.",

This study presents the design and implementation of a real-time pest detection system that integrates robotics, computer vision, and deep learning to enhance agricultural productivity. The system is built on a Raspberry Pi 5 and Arduino Mega Pro Mini, utilizing a camera for image capture and ultrasonic sensors for navigation. A ResNet-based model was trained on a dataset of 2,703 chili leaf images, categorized into healthy and diseased classes, achieving a detection accuracy of  91%. The system provides early warnings to farmers through a web-based interface, allowing timely intervention and reducing reliance on chemical pesticides. While promising, the system faced challenges such as environmental variability, which influenced image recognition accuracy. By automating pest detection and promoting precision farming, this innovation addresses the need for sustainable agricultural practices, contributing to global food security and reducing environmental impact.",

Focused on managing diverse scales in health attributes within the stroke dataset, the research aims to improve classification model accuracy and reliability. Preprocessing involves z-score standardization, min-max normalization, and no data scaling. The KNN model is trained and evaluated using various methods. Results reveal comparable performance between z-score standardization and min-max normalization, with slight variations across data split ratios. Demonstrating the importance of data scaling, both z-score and min-max achieve 95.07% accuracy. Notably, normalization averages a higher accuracy (94.25%) than standardization (94.21%), highlighting the critical role of data scaling for robust machine learning performance and informed health decisions.",

Novel methods of cassava disease detection are needed to support improved control which will prevent this crisis. Image recognition offers both a cost effective and scalable technology for disease detection. New deep learning models offer an avenue for this technology to be easily deployed on mobile devices. Using a dataset of cassava disease images taken in the field in Tanzania, we applied transfer learning to train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases and two types of pest damage (or lack thereof). The best trained model accuracies were 98% for brown leaf spot (BLS), 96% for red mite damage (RMD), 95% for green mite damage (GMD), 98% for cassava brown streak disease (CBSD), and 96% for cassava mosaic disease (CMD). The best model achieved an overall accuracy of 93% for data not used in the training process. Our results show that the transfer learning approach for image recognition of field images offers a fast, affordable, and easily deployable strategy for digital plant disease detection.",

            "abstract": "Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.",

We have considered diseases of apple as a test case and evaluated our approach for three types of apple diseases namely apple scab, apple blotch and apple rot. Our experimental results express that the proposed solution can significantly support accurate detection and automatic identification of fruit diseases.

            "abstract": "Agricultural pests are responsible for millions of dollars in crop losses and management costs every year. In order to implement optimal site-specific treatments and reduce control costs, new methods to accurately monitor and assess pest damage need to be investigated. In this paper we explore the combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), remote sensing and machine learning techniques as a promising technology to address this challenge. The deployment of UAVs as a sensor platform is a rapidly growing field of study for biosecurity and precision agriculture applications. In this experiment, a data collection campaign is performed over a sorghum crop severely damaged by white grubs (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). The larvae of these scarab beetles feed on the roots of plants, which in turn impairs root exploration of the soil profile. In the field, crop health status could be classified according to three levels: bare soil where plants were decimated, transition zones of reduced plant density and healthy canopy areas. In this study, we describe the UAV platform deployed to collect high-resolution RGB imagery as well as the image processing pipeline implemented to create an orthoimage. An unsupervised machine learning approach is formulated in order to create a meaningful partition of the image into each of the crop levels. The aim of the approach is to simplify the image analysis step by minimizing user input requirements and avoiding the manual data labeling necessary in supervised learning approaches. The implemented algorithm is based on the K-means clustering algorithm. In order to control high-frequency components present in the feature space, a neighbourhood-oriented parameter is introduced by applying Gaussian convolution kernels prior to K-means. The outcome of this approach is a soft K-means algorithm similar to the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models. The results show the algorithm delivers decision boundaries that consistently classify the field into three clusters, one for each crop health level. The methodology presented in this paper represents a venue for further research towards automated crop damage assessments and biosecurity surveillance.",

        "abstract": "Crop Protection is the key element to achieve food security. Many studies have been conducted over the decades to avoid crop losses during pre- harvest and post-harvest stages. Crop losses due to pest attack and plant disease spread, reduces the agriculture production and possess a direct impact on the economy of a country. Deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pest control strategies to detect pest species is under research. In this manuscript, deep learning based EfficientNetB7 architecture and transfer learning methodology is used to develop a real-time resource-efficient pest detection system. EfficientNetB7's innovative compound scaling technique has managed to balance efficiency in terms of computations and accuracy to effectively classify pests through images with minimal resources. The proposed system uses appropriate fine-tuning of training parameters and regularization mechanisms such as optimizers, data augmentation, to effectively develop a pest detection system. The trained model is ported on to STM32 microcontroller using CubeAI in STM32CubeIDE.The model is assessed by using a publicly available dataset, and a classification accuracy of 93.5% is achieved. This system not only automates pest detection but also provides a match percentage for the identified pests, thus supporting precision agriculture. Future work includes increasing the dataset and exploring edge AI techniques for decentralized decision-making. This manuscript showcases the transformative potential of EfficientNetB7 in precision agriculture, offering a scalable, cost-effective, and sustainable solution for the detection of pests with relevant broader impacts on agricultural automation practices.",

In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. \nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

            "abstract": "The application of digital technologies to facilitate farming activities has been on the rise in recent years. Among different tasks, the classification of weeds is a prerequisite for smart farming, and various techniques have been proposed to automatically detect weeds from images. However, many studies deal with weed images collected in the laboratory settings, and this might not be applicable to real-world scenarios. In this sense, there is still the need for robust classification systems that can be deployed in the field. In this work, we propose a practical solution to recognition of weeds exploiting two versions of EfficientNet as the recommendation engine. More importantly, to make the learning more effective, we also utilize different transfer learning strategies. The final aim is to build an expert system capable of accurately detecting weeds from lively captured images. We evaluate the approach’s performance using DeepWeeds, a real-world dataset with 17,509 images. The experimental results show that the application of EfficientNet and transfer learning on the considered dataset substantially improves the overall prediction accuracy in various settings. Through the evaluation, we also demonstrate that the conceived tool outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. We expect that the proposed framework can be installed in robots to work on rice fields in Vietnam, allowing farmers to find and eliminate weeds in an automatic manner.",

        "abstract": "Canker, a disease that causes considerable financial losses in the agricultural business, is a small deep lesion that is visible on the leaves of many plants, especially citrus/apple trees. Canker detection is critical for limiting its spread and minimizing harm. To address this issue, we describe a computer vision-based technique that detects Canker in citrus leaves using image embedding and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The major steps in our proposed model include image embedding, and machine learning model training and testing. We started with preprocessing and then used image embedding techniques like Inception V3 and VGG 16 to turn the ROIs into feature vectors that retained the relevant information associated with Canker leaf disease, using the feature vectors acquired from the embedding stage, we then train and evaluate various ML models such as support vector machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, neural network, and K Nearest Neighbor. Our experimental results utilizing a citrus leaf picture dataset show that the proposed strategy works. With Inception V3 as the image embedder and neural network machine learning model we have obtained an accuracy of 95.6% which suggests that our approach is effective in canker identification. Our method skips traditional image processing techniques that rely on by hand features and produces results equivalent to cutting-edge methods that use deep learning models. Finally, our proposed method provides a dependable and efficient method for detecting Canker in leaves. Farmers and agricultural specialists can benefit greatly from early illness diagnosis and quick intervention to avoid disease spread as adoption of such methods can significantly reduce the losses incurred by farmers and improve the quality of agricultural produce.",

Accurate classification and identification of microorganisms are crucial for professionals in diverse areas, including clinical microbiology, agriculture, and food production. Traditional methods for analyzing microorganisms, like culture techniques and manual microscopy, can be labor-intensive, expensive, and occasionally inadequate due to morphological similarities between different species. As a result, there is an increasing need for intelligent image recognition systems to automate microorganism classification procedures with minimal human involvement. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of ML and DL perspectives used for the precise recognition and classification of microorganism images, utilizing a dataset comprising eight distinct microorganism types: Spherical bacteria, Amoeba, Hydra, Paramecium, Rod bacteria, Spiral bacteria, Euglena and Yeast. We employed several ml algorithms including SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, as well as the deep learning algorithm CNN. Among these methods, the highest accuracy was achieved using the CNN approach.

As a result, there is a pressing need for a system that can accurately identify and control rice plant diseases automatically. CNNs have demonstrated their effectiveness in detecting plant diseases, thanks to their exceptional image classification capabilities. Nevertheless, research on rice plant disease identification remains scarce. This study offers a comprehensive overview of rice plant ailments and explores DL techniques used for their detection. By evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of various systems found in the literature, the study aims to identify the most accurate means of detecting and controlling rice plant diseases using DL techniques. We present a real-time detection and diagnostic system for rice lead diseases that utilizes ML methods. This system is designed to identify three prevalent rice plant diseases, specially leaf smut, bacterial leaf blight and brown spot diseases. Clear images of affected rice leaves against a white background serve as input data for the system. To train the dataset, several ML algorithms were employed including KNN, Naive Bayes, J48 and Logistic Regression. Following the pre-processing stage, the decision tree algorithm demonstrated an accurateness of over 97% when claimed to test dataset. In conclusion, implementing an automated system that leverages ML techniques is vital for reducing the time and labor required for detecting and managing rice plant diseases. Such a system would contribute significantly to ensuring the healthy growth of rice plants in Bangladesh, ultimately boosting the nation’s rice production.",

        "abstract": "Different diseases affecting cotton plants can be diagnosed and controlled to obtain high yields of good quality cotton. In this study, we propose a methodology for categorizing crop disease images into two groups: diseased and healthy images using feature extraction based on Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal of this study is to improve disease diagnosis using image processing by applying the texture co-occurrence matrix, which gives information on the relationship of pixel intensity of the images. The proposed model is then tested on a cotton crop dataset, and the accuracy score is 86%. These findings enrich the literature by proving the concept that integrating texture-based feature extraction with sophisticated machine-learning approaches to the classification of crop disease highlights diagnostic precision to boost the efficacy of precision agriculture.",

The combination of increasing global smartphone penetration and recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for smartphone-assisted disease diagnosis. Using a public dataset of 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases (or absence thereof). The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. Overall, the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path toward smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.",

Organic coffee is grown & handled in proper and good agro ecosystem while not taking help of the artificial chemicals. As these are grown in slope regions in the hills by adapting organic farming techniques not only protects the environment but also helps in reducing the contamination in surrounding water bodies that are present in the hilly tracts. Many pests effect the growing condition of the crops. Xylotrechus Quadripes also known as Coffee White Stem Borer is a pest that accounts up to 70 % of yield loss in the coffee plantation in India. In cultivation the stem of the affected plants are timely removed before the maturation of the fruits. This technique is called Stem Breaking or Stem Cutting. The main aim of the project is to build a robot which removes stems of defected plants autonomously and efficiently. The objective is not only just a robot that classifies & identifies some of the leaf diseases in cotton plants but also must remove the defected plants. The provided solution must be economically good as well as the performance should be on par with that of people. The main challenge in stem cutting refers to recognizing the correct stem among the ‘Sea of Green’ & remove that efficiently.",

It provides sustenance to almost fifty percent of the world population and promotes huge amount of employments. Hence, proper mitigation of rice plant diseases is of paramount importance. A model to detect three rice leaf diseases, namely Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, and Leaf Smut is proposed in this paper. Backgrounds of the images are removed by saturation threshold while disease affected areas are segmented using hue threshold. Distinctive features from color, shape, and texture domain are extracted from affected areas. These features can robustly describe local and global statistics of such images. Trying a couple of classification algorithms, Extreme Gradient Boosting decision tree ensemble is incorporated in this model for its superior performance. Our model achieves 86.58% accuracy on Rice Leaf Diseases dataset from UCI, which is higher than previous works on the same dataset. Class-wise accuracy of the model is also consistent among the classes.",

In recent years, with the advantages of automatic learning and feature extraction, it has been widely concerned by academic and industrial circles. It has been widely used in image and video processing, voice processing, and natural language processing. At the same time, it has also become a research hotspot in the field of agricultural plant protection, such as plant disease recognition and pest range assessment, etc. The application of deep learning in plant disease recognition can avoid the disadvantages caused by artificial selection of disease spot features, make plant disease feature extraction more objective, and improve the research efficiency and technology transformation speed. This review provides the research progress of deep learning technology in the field of crop leaf disease identification in recent years. In this paper, we present the current trends and challenges for the detection of plant leaf disease using deep learning and advanced imaging techniques. We hope that this work will be a valuable resource for researchers who study the detection of plant diseases and insect pests. At the same time, we also discussed some of the current challenges and problems that need to be resolved.",

The article reveals the data on the widespread types of plant diseases (rot, wilting, deformation, the formation of tumors, pustules, etc.) and their symptoms. Early identification of the pathogen type of plant infection is of high significance for disease control. Various methods are used to diagnose pathogens of disease on plant. This article discusses the review of the literature data on traditional methods for diagnosis of plant pathogens, such as visual observation, microscopy, mycological analysis, and biological diagnostics or the use of indicator plants. Rapid and reliable detection of plant disease and identification of its pathogen is the first and most important stage in disease control. Early identification of the cause of the disease allows timely selection of the proper protection method and ensures prevention of crop losses. There are a number of traditional methods for identifying plant diseases, however, in order to ensure the promptness and reliability of diagnostics, as well as to eliminate the shortcomings inherent in traditional diagnostics, in recent years, new means and technologies for identifying pathogens have been developed and introduced into practice. As well as the article provides information on such innovative methods of diagnosis of diseases and identification of their pathogens, which are used widely in the world today, such as immunodiagnostics, molecular-genetic (and phylogenetic) identification, mass spectrometry, etc.",

Plant disease may cause significant losses in food production and eradicate diversity in species. Early diagnosis of plant diseases using accurate or automatic detection techniques can enhance the quality of food production and minimize economic losses. In recent years, deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in the recognition accuracy of image classification and object detection systems. Hence, in this paper, we utilized convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pre-trained models for efficient plant disease identification. We focused on fine tuning the hyperparameters of popular pre-trained models, such as DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception V4. The experiments were carried out using the popular PlantVillage dataset, which has 54,305 image samples of different plant disease species in 38 classes. The performance of the model was evaluated through classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. A comparative analysis was also performed with similar state-of-the-art studies. The experiments proved that DenseNet-121 achieved 99.81% higher classification accuracy, which was superior to state-of-the-art models.",

Diseases that affect crops substantially negatively impact the quantity and quality of agricultural products. Regarding quality crop maintenance, the importance of a timely and accurate diagnosis cannot be overstated. Deep learning (DL) strategies are now a critical research field for crop disease diagnoses. One independent system that can diagnose plant illnesses based on their outward manifestations is an example of an intelligent agriculture solution that could address these problems. This work proposes a robust hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) diagnostic tool for various disorders that may affect tomato leaf tissue. A CNN and an inception module are the two components that make up this hybrid technique. The dataset employed for this study consists of nine distinct categories of tomato diseases and one healthy category sourced from PlantVillage. The findings are promising on the test set, with 99.17% accuracy, 99.23% recall, 99.13% precision, 99.56% AUC, and 99.17% F1-score, respectively. The proposed methodology offers a solution that boasts high performance for the diagnostics of tomato crops in the actual agricultural setting.",

Appropriate and timely deployment of disease management depends on early disease detection. Incorrect and delayed diagnosis can result in either excessive or inadequate use of chemicals, with increased production costs, environmental, and health impacts. We have manually captured 3,651 high-quality, real-life symptom images of multiple apple foliar diseases, with variable illumination, angles, surfaces, and noise. A subset, expert-annotated to create a pilot dataset for apple scab, cedar apple rust, and healthy leaves, was made available to the Kaggle community for 'Plant Pathology Challenge'; part of the Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) workshop at CVPR 2020 (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). We also trained an off-the-shelf convolutional neural network (CNN) on this data for disease classification and achieved 97% accuracy on a held-out test set. This dataset will contribute towards development and deployment of machine learning-based automated plant disease classification algorithms to ultimately realize fast and accurate disease detection. We will continue to add images to the pilot dataset for a larger, more comprehensive expert-annotated dataset for future Kaggle competitions and to explore more advanced methods for disease classification and quantification.",

This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves, with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge, this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images in order to create a database, assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe, a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre, was used to perform the deep CNN training. The experimental results on the developed model achieved precision between 91% and 98%, for separate class tests, on average 96.3%.",

Identification of some Alternaria species, especially those that produce host-specific toxins, has been extremely difficult due to a high level of variability which extends even to nonpathogenic isolates. We have recently cloned and characterized a gene (AMT) that plays a crucial role in AM-toxin biosynthesis and demonstrated that it is only present in isolates of A. alternata apple pathotype. Using primers designed for the AMT gene, we developed a polymerase chainreaction-based method to specifically detect AM-toxin producing isolates of A. alternata apple pathotype.",

Optical techniques, such as RGB imaging, multi- and hyperspectral sensors, thermography, or chlorophyll fluorescence, have proven their potential in automated, objective, and reproducible detection systems for the identification and quantification of plant diseases at early time points in epidemics. Recently, 3D scanning has also been added as an optical analysis that supplies additional information on crop plant vitality. Different platforms from proximal to remote sensing are available for multiscale monitoring of single crop organs or entire fields. Accurate and reliable detection of diseases is facilitated by highly sophisticated and innovative methods of data analysis that lead to new insights derived from sensor data for complex plant-pathogen systems. Nondestructive, sensor-based methods support and expand upon visual and/or molecular approaches to plant disease assessment. The most relevant areas of application of sensor-based analyses are precision agriculture and plant phenotyping.",

Accurate results are possible when the symptoms and leaf veins have similar color and shade characteristics. The algorithm is subject to one constraint: the background must be as close to white or black as possible. Tests showed that the method provided accurate estimates over a wide variety of conditions, being robust to variation in size, shape, and color of leaves; symptoms; and leaf veins. Low rates of false positives and false negatives occurred due to extrinsic factors such as issues with image capture and the use of extreme file compression ratios.",

            "abstract": "Fire blight caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora is known to incite substantial damage in pomefruit production. The disease originated in North America, from where it slowly spread around the world. Hosts of E. amylovora are members of the Maloidae, such as apple, pear and quince, and ornamentals, such as Cotoneaster, Crataegus and Mespilus. The disease can affect all tree parts such as blossoms, shoot tips and rootstock crowns. The name of the disease resembles the main symptom in host plants, i.e. the black necrosis of shoots and browning of leaves. Antibiotics provide effective control, but these are increasingly banned due to ecological considerations and the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of E. amylovora. Alternative control strategies are based on copper ions and the application of antagonists. The use of fire blight resistant cultivars is another approach to prevent fire blight epidemics. Fire blight resistance is present in the cultivated apple, but high levels of resistance generally are found in wild species of apple and pear. The introduction of wild species’ traits into cultivars is a slow process in fruit tree breeding. Understanding the genetics of the disease resistance, biotechnology and genetic engineering can promote and accelerate classical breeding. This review focuses on crop improvement for fire blight resistance. We describe the origin of the disease, its spread and the infection tools of the pathogen, summarize the genetic resources available to breeders and strategies to improve apple and pear for fire blight resistance. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________",

This study presents an advanced deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify plant leaf diseases. Utilizing the Plant Village dataset, a custom CNN model was developed, which achieved superior accuracy of $\\mathbf{9 6. 1 1 \\%}$, surpassing popular transfer learning models such as ResNet152-v2 (94%), VGG16 (91%), and Inceptionv 3 ($88 \\%$). Key aspects of this work include the implementation of robust data preprocessing techniques like image augmentation and the design of an optimized CNN architecture to enhance performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, explainability was explored using Layer CAM, which provided more detailed visual explanations than Grad-CAM, thereby increasing the model’s transparency and trustworthiness. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for accurate plant disease identification, positioning it as a promising tool for agricultural disease diagnosis. Future efforts will focus on expanding the dataset, improving model generalization, and deploying the model for real-time field applications.",

            "abstract": "We propose a technique for producing ‘visual explanations’ for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent and explainable. Our approach—Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classification network or a sequence of words in captioning network) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g.captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g.visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, all without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are robust to adversarial perturbations, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (e) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models learn to localize discriminative regions of input image. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names (Bau et al. in Computer vision and pattern recognition, 2017) to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a ‘stronger’ deep network from a ‘weaker’ one even when both make identical predictions.

            "abstract": "Alternaria leaf spot, Brown spot, Mosaic, Grey spot, and Rust are five common types of apple leaf diseases that severely affect apple yield. However, the existing research lacks an accurate and fast detector of apple diseases for ensuring the healthy development of the apple industry. This paper proposes a deep learning approach that is based on improved convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the real-time detection of apple leaf diseases. In this paper, the apple leaf disease dataset (ALDD), which is composed of laboratory images and complex images under real field conditions, is first constructed via data augmentation and image annotation technologies. Based on this, a new apple leaf disease detection model that uses deep-CNNs is proposed by introducing the GoogLeNet Inception structure and Rainbow concatenation. Finally, under the hold-out testing dataset, using a dataset of 26,377 images of diseased apple leaves, the proposed INAR-SSD (SSD with Inception module and Rainbow concatenation) model is trained to detect these five common apple leaf diseases. The experimental results show that the INAR-SSD model realizes a detection performance of 78.80% mAP on ALDD, with a high-detection speed of 23.13 FPS. The results demonstrate that the novel INAR-SSD model provides a high-performance solution for the early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases that can perform real-time detection of these diseases with higher accuracy and faster detection speed than previous methods.",

            "abstract": "Skip connections are an essential component of current state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) such as ResNet, WideResNet, DenseNet, and ResNeXt. Despite their huge success in building deeper and more powerful DNNs, we identify a surprising \\emph{security weakness} of skip connections in this paper. Use of skip connections \\textit{allows easier generation of highly transferable adversarial examples}. Specifically, in ResNet-like (with skip connections) neural networks, gradients can backpropagate through either skip connections or residual modules. We find that using more gradients from the skip connections rather than the residual modules according to a decay factor, allows one to craft adversarial examples with high transferability. Our method is termed \\emph{Skip Gradient Method} (SGM). We conduct comprehensive transfer attacks against state-of-the-art DNNs including ResNets, DenseNets, Inceptions, Inception-ResNet, Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet) and robustly trained DNNs. We show that employing SGM on the gradient flow can greatly improve the transferability of crafted attacks in almost all cases. Furthermore, SGM can be easily combined with existing black-box attack techniques, and obtain high improvements over state-of-the-art transferability methods. Our findings not only motivate new research into the architectural vulnerability of DNNs, but also open up further challenges for the design of secure DNN architectures.",

In this paper, authors proposed an automated greenhouse monitoring and controlling system that incorporate various sensors such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor, light sensor and soil moisture sensor to collect possible environmental parameters of greenhouse as well as integrate Arduino Uno R3 (to store and process data), GSM module (to send the measured value of the various parameters to the user cell phone via SMS to ensure efficient growth of plants), solar power system with rechargeable battery (to make sure continuous power supply to the greenhouse system). Moreover, Internet of Things (IoT) is used to store data to a database and process the collected data and finally send the information to the android apps which has been developed for monitoring and controlling of greenhouse by the user. Moreover, the authors compared the proposed greenhouse model with some recent works and found the proposed system cost effective, efficient and effective by analyzing major environmental parameters. Finally, authors analyze the cost associated with the deployment of proposed greenhouse model which depict quite affordable for farmers and worth deploying.",

In recent years, with the advantages of automatic learning and feature extraction, it has been widely concerned by academic and industrial circles. It has been widely used in image and video processing, voice processing, and natural language processing. At the same time, it has also become a research hotspot in the field of agricultural plant protection, such as plant disease recognition and pest range assessment, etc. The application of deep learning in plant disease recognition can avoid the disadvantages caused by artificial selection of disease spot features, make plant disease feature extraction more objective, and improve the research efficiency and technology transformation speed. This review provides the research progress of deep learning technology in the field of crop leaf disease identification in recent years. In this paper, we present the current trends and challenges for the detection of plant leaf disease using deep learning and advanced imaging techniques. We hope that this work will be a valuable resource for researchers who study the detection of plant diseases and insect pests. At the same time, we also discussed some of the current challenges and problems that need to be resolved.",

            "abstract": "The class activation maps are generated from the final convolutional layer of CNN. They can highlight discriminative object regions for the class of interest. These discovered object regions have been widely used for weakly-supervised tasks. However, due to the small spatial resolution of the final convolutional layer, such class activation maps often locate coarse regions of the target objects, limiting the performance of weakly-supervised tasks that need pixel-accurate object locations. Thus, we aim to generate more fine-grained object localization information from the class activation maps to locate the target objects more accurately. In this paper, by rethinking the relationships between the feature maps and their corresponding gradients, we propose a simple yet effective method, called LayerCAM. It can produce reliable class activation maps for different layers of CNN. This property enables us to collect object localization information from coarse (rough spatial localization) to fine (precise fine-grained details) levels. We further integrate them into a high-quality class activation map, where the object-related pixels can be better highlighted. To evaluate the quality of the class activation maps produced by LayerCAM, we apply them to weakly-supervised object localization and semantic segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that the class activation maps generated by our method are more effective and reliable than those by the existing attention methods. The code will be made publicly available.",

        "abstract": "India is a land of agriculture, and it has a deep impact in the economic growth of our country. Around 10-20% crops in India, suffer from various diseases that can lead to those crops getting wasted therefore this is one of the major concerns for the farmers to protect their crops from such diseases. To prevent the plants from getting wasted the disease should be detected as soon as possible so that the farmer can take the necessary steps to save the crops from getting wasted. Farmers have been using their conventional methods for years to identify diseases, but it is hard for them to identify various diseases with high accuracy. Now with the advancement in Artificial Intelligence and Computer vision, we can use various techniques to solve this problem of disease detection in different plants with more accurate results. This will lead to a fast and early diagnosis of the disease and will help to decrease crop wastage making it more beneficial for the farmer and for the whole country. In this research paper, we have made use of Deep Learning a very popular technology nowadays as it provides various models and functionalities to work with images. We have used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for this research paper as it is one of the best in image classification and is also good at extracting smaller details from the image which will work well for the detection of disease in a plant by diagnosing the images of its leaf. We have made use of Plant Village Dataset for our model which contains more than 60,000 RGB images of both healthy and unhealthy leaves as well.",

            "abstract": "Leaf diseases reduce agricultural yield by 35% annually in India, where agriculture is the main sector. Manual detection of the type of disease present in leaves takes a long time since laboratories lack the necessary tools and expertise to recognise early leaf diseases. Diseases include early blight, late blight, black root, bacterial spot, mould leaf, healthy leaf, etc. Automated leaf disease detection systems are beneficial for spotting disease symptoms on plant leaves as soon as they appear, which helps to ease the time-consuming process of monitoring large agricultural farms. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and computer vision models have highlighted the importance of developing autonomous leaf disease detection algorithms based on visual symptoms on leaves. The fundamental goal of the proposed model is to tackle the problem of leaf disease diagnosis using the most basic strategy while utilising the fewest computer resources to generate results comparable to state-of-the-art techniques. We used the multilayered architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify and overcome leaf diseases. When compared to existing techniques, our proposed method can successfully train an image classification model to achieve 98.5% accuracy.",

            "abstract": "To sustain healthy crop yields and avoid extensive plant disease damage, it is essential to diagnose plant leaves. Traditional diagnostic techniques, however, can be laborious and complicated. Deep learning methods like ResNet 34 have recently come to light as a potential strategy for automating plant leaf diagnosis. Deep convolutional neural network ResNet 34 is capable of correctly classifying photos of plant leaves based on patterns and characteristics. A ResNet 34 model may be taught to recognize different leaf illnesses and other anomalies with excellent accuracy by training it on a huge dataset of tagged plant leaf photos. The ResNet 34 model's output may be seen on a website, enabling users to upload pictures of plant leaves and get a diagnosis in a matter of seconds. Also, the website might include details on the particular ailment or issue found, along with suggested remedies and prevention actions. The way of identifying and treating plant illnesses may be completely altered by this method of diagnosing plant leaves, which would ultimately result in healthier crops and a more sustainable future. Farmers, agronomists, and other stakeholders will find it simpler to recognize and effectively treat plant diseases thanks to the usage of ResNet 34 and a website for output display, which offers an accessible and user-friendly interface for plant diagnostics.",

A significant amount of food grains is lost by farmers each year as a result of the absence of automated tools that can precisely detect plant diseases. At the moment, depending just on eye observations requires a great level of experience and cannot be assured to be accurate. In order to solve these issues, we suggested a way to recognise and categorise rice plant illnesses. A publicly accessible benchmark dataset including 1800 photos was enhanced to include 12,600 images. Four classes are included in the dataset: Leaf Blast, Brown Spot, Hispa, and Healthy Leaves. We used the Faster R-CNN approach for disease diagnosis and classification, adjusting parameters to increase precision. Our approach can help with early diagnosis with high precision, with accuracy of 98.20%, 99.15%, 97.5%, and 99.5% for Brown Spot, Hispa, Leaf Blast, and healthy leaf identification, respectively. Our approach can be enhanced for practical agricultural use and help farmers avoid crop damage and disease.",

The multi-task loss simplifies learning and improves detection accuracy. Unlike SPPnet, all network layers can be updated during fine-tuning. We show that this difference has practical ramifications for very deep networks, such as VGG16, where mAP suffers when only the fully-connected layers are updated. Compared to\"slow\"R-CNN, Fast R-CNN is 9x faster at training VGG16 for detection, 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a significantly higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate.

        "abstract": ": Machine learning models have been used to protect the plant from leaf disease by early detection and classification in the field of agriculture. Farmers' principal source of income is agriculture, and plant leaf disease causes them to lose a lot of crop each year. It is essential to provide food for the whole world by detecting disease at an early stage in the farm for future decision-making. However, there is currently no such kind of system in place to forecast a disease at an early stage. The primary goal of this research is to inform farmers about a novel strategy for preventing leaf disease in plants. Through this research and earlier diagnosis, the losses incurred by farmers might be decreased. In this study, we have suggested a unique custom parallel deep convolutional neural network-based model for the classification of leaf diseases on the farm. This proposed CNN model is trained using the plant village dataset with 10 different categories of leaf disease classes. The patterns of leaf images at particular times are utilized in conjunction with computer vision techniques to detect plant leaf diseases. The tomato plant is taken into consideration for current scientific efforts in disease identification, categorization, and diagnosis. Image resizing, cropping, segmentation using k-means clustering and thresholding, and normalization are five different types of data preprocessing techniques used. The suggested approach may accurately diagnose diseases by automatically extracting features using implicit CNN. During comparisons with the testing of the given data, the output of the proposed model is 99.65%, which is better than transfer learning models available in the literature. This suggested model may be checked for consistency and reliability, and farmers can use it as a practical tool to protect their leaf plants from any kind of disease.",

We demonstrate a system capable of automatically identifying NLB lesions in field-acquired images of maize plants with high reliability. This approach uses a computational pipeline of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that addresses the challenges of limited data and the myriad irregularities that appear in images of field-grown plants. Several CNNs were trained to classify small regions of images as containing NLB lesions or not; their predictions were combined into separate heat maps, then fed into a final CNN trained to classify the entire image as containing diseased plants or not. The system achieved 96.7% accuracy on test set images not used in training. We suggest that such systems mounted on aerial- or ground-based vehicles can help in automated high-throughput plant phenotyping, precision breeding for disease resistance, and reduced pesticide use through targeted application across a variety of plant and disease categories.",

This was achieved by gathering images of leaves and clusters of grapes affected by diseases in their natural context. The dataset contains photos of 10 object types which include leaves and grapes with and without symptoms of the eight more common grape diseases, with a total of 17,706 labeled instances in 1,092 images. Multiple statistical measures are proposed in order to offer a complete view on the characteristics of the dataset.

An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

However, the existing research lacks a real-time detecting method for grape leaf diseases, which cannot guarantee the healthy growth of grape plants. In this article, a real-time detector for grape leaf diseases based on improved deep convolutional neural networks is proposed. This article first expands the grape leaf disease images through digital image processing technology, constructing the grape leaf disease dataset (GLDD). Based on GLDD and the Faster R-CNN detection algorithm, a deep-learning-based Faster DR-IACNN model with higher feature extraction capability is presented for detecting grape leaf diseases by introducing the Inception-v1 module, Inception-ResNet-v2 module and SE-blocks. The experimental results show that the detection model Faster DR-IACNN achieves a precision of 81.1% mAP on GLDD, and the detection speed reaches 15.01 FPS. This research indicates that the real-time detector Faster DR-IACNN based on deep learning provides a feasible solution for the diagnosis of grape leaf diseases and provides guidance for the detection of other plant diseases.",

Each pixel is labelled according to the object class within which it is enclosed. Furthering this evolution, instance segmentation gives different labels for separate instances of objects belonging to the same class. Hence, instance segmentation may be defined as the technique of simultaneously solving the problem of object detection as well as that of semantic segmentation.

Appropriate and timely deployment of disease management depends on early disease detection. Incorrect and delayed diagnosis can result in either excessive or inadequate use of chemicals, with increased production costs and increased environmental and health impacts. Methods and Results We have manually captured 3651 high‐quality, real‐life symptom images of multiple apple foliar diseases, with variable illumination, angles, surfaces, and noise. A subset of images, expert‐annotated to create a pilot data set for apple scab, cedar apple rust, and healthy leaves, was made available to the Kaggle community for the Plant Pathology Challenge as part of the Fine‐Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) workshop at the 2020 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference (CVPR 2020). Participants were asked to use the image data set to train a machine learning model to classify disease categories and develop an algorithm for disease severity quantification. The top three area under the ROC curve (AUC) values submitted to the private leaderboard were 0.98445, 0.98182, and 0.98089. We also trained an off‐the‐shelf convolutional neural network on this data for disease classification and achieved 97% accuracy on a held‐out test set. Discussion This data set will contribute toward development and deployment of machine learning–based automated plant disease classification algorithms to ultimately realize fast and accurate disease detection. We will continue to add images to the pilot data set for a larger, more comprehensive expert‐annotated data set for future Kaggle competitions and to explore more advanced methods for disease classification and quantification.",

The system employs convolutional neural networks to analyze images of potato plants, identifying various diseases such as late blight, early blight, and bacterial wilt. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and a large dataset of annotated potato plant images, the model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and diseased specimens. This automated approach offers farmers a rapid and reliable tool for monitoring crop health, enabling timely interventions to prevent yield losses and reduce the need for extensive pesticide use. The system integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of diseased and healthy potato leaf images to identify infections with high precision. A camera module captures real-time images, which are processed to detect symptoms such as blight, mosaic virus, and leaf spot. Additionally, a mobile application provides instant feedback, enabling farmers to take timely preventive measures. The combination of image processing, machine learning, and real-time monitoring enhances the efficiency and reliability of disease detection, making it a valuable tool for sustainable agriculture.",

            "abstract": "▪ Abstract  Plant health management is the science and practice of understanding and overcoming the succession of biotic and abiotic factors that limit plants from achieving their full genetic potential as crops, ornamentals, timber trees, or other uses. Although practiced as long as agriculture itself, as a science-based concept, plant heath management is even younger than integrated pest management (IPM), and includes and builds upon but is not a replacement for IPM. Probably the greatest collection of success stories for plant health management is the number of diseases managed by cleaning up the planting material. The record for root health management is more mixed, with the loss or phase-out of soil fumigants, and practices such as crop rotation and clean tillage being replaced with more intensive cropping and less or no tillage. Perhaps the greatest scientific and technical advances for plant health management have come from the work aimed at management of the pathogens, pests, and other hazards that arrive by air. Flor's work on flax rust, which produced the gene-for-gene model, is possibly the most significant contribution of plant pathology to the life sciences in the twentieth century. Research aimed at the management of foliar pathogens is also the basis for modern theory on epidemiology, population biology, aerobiology, and disease prediction and decision-support systems. Even IPM arose mainly in response to the need to protect crops from pests that arrive by air. If the definition of biological control includes the plant induced or genetically modified to defend itself, as it should, then biological control has been the most significant approach to plant health management during the twentieth century and promises through modern biotechnology to be even more significant in the twenty-first century. Rather than \"reducing losses,\" the advances are discussed here within the simple framework of achieving the attainable yield by increasing the actual and/or affordable and hence the average yield. Each of these four benchmark yields, as well as the absolute yield for crops, and their significance to the goals and achievements of plant health management are defined. Plant health management is a moving target, which I discuss metaphorically like an American football game, where one team is science and technology and the other is nature, where the S & T team is only beginning to know nature's rules while playing itself with the three sets of rules written to, respectively, satisfy the laws of economics, protect the environment, and gain social acceptance.",

This work proposes a lightweight transfer learning-based approach for detecting diseases from tomato leaves. It utilizes an effective preprocessing method to enhance the leaf images with illumination correction for improved classification. Our system extracts features using a combined model consisting of a pretrained MobileNetV2 architecture and a classifier network for effective prediction. Traditional augmentation approaches are replaced by runtime augmentation to avoid data leakage and address the class imbalance issue. Evaluation on tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset shows that the proposed architecture achieves 99.30% accuracy with a model size of 9.60MB and 4.87M floating-point operations, making it a suitable choice for low-end devices. Our codes and models will be made available upon publication.",

            "abstract": "In the twenty-first century, machine learning is a significant part of daily life for everyone. Today, it is adopted in many different applications, such as object recognition, object classification, and medical purposes. This research aimed to use deep convolutional neural networks for the real-time detection of diseases in plant leaves. Typically, farmers are unaware of diseases on plant leaves and adopt manual disease detection methods. Their production often decreases as the virus spreads. However, due to a lack of essential infrastructure, quick identification needs to be improved in many regions of the world. It is now feasible to diagnose diseases using mobile devices as a result of the increase in mobile phone usage globally and recent advancements in computer vision due to deep learning. To conduct this research, firstly, a dataset was created that contained images of money plant leaves that had been split into two primary categories, specifically (i) healthy and (ii) unhealthy. This research collected thousands of images in a controlled environment and used a public dataset with exact dimensions. The next step was to train a deep model to identify healthy and unhealthy leaves. Our trained YOLOv5 model was applied to determine the spots on the exclusive and public datasets. This research quickly and accurately identified even a small patch of disease with the help of YOLOv5. It captured the entire image in one shot and forecasted adjacent boxes and class certainty. A random dataset image served as the model’s input via a cell phone. This research is beneficial for farmers since it allows them to recognize diseased leaves as soon as they noted and take the necessary precautions to halt the disease’s spread. This research aimed to provide the best hyper-parameters for classifying and detecting the healthy and unhealthy parts of leaves in exclusive and public datasets. Our trained YOLOv5 model achieves 93 % accuracy on a test set.",

Since tomato plant farming take considerations from various variables such as environment, soil, and amount of sunlight, existence of diseases cannot be avoided. The recent advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning has paved the way for camera-assisted disease diagnosis for tomato. This study developed the innovative solution that provides efficient disease detection in tomato plants. A motor-controlled image capturing box was made to capture four sides of every tomato plant to detect and recognize leaf diseases. A specific breed of tomato which is Diamante Max was used as the test subject. The system was designed to identify the diseases namely Phoma Rot, Leaf Miner, and Target Spot. Using dataset of 4,923 images of diseased and healthy tomato plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, we train a deep convolutional neural network to identify three diseases or absence thereof. The system used Convolutional Neural Network to identify which of the tomato diseases is present on the monitored tomato plants. The F-RCNN trained anomaly detection model produced a confidence score of 80 % while the Transfer Learning disease recognition model achieves an accuracy of 95.75 %. The automated image capturing system was implemented in actual and registered a 91.67 % accuracy in the recognition of the tomato plant leaf diseases.",

The tropical climate is ideal for its growth, however certain climatic conditions and various other factors affect the normal growth of tomato plants. Apart from these climatic conditions and natural disasters, plant disease is a major crisis in crop production and results in economic loss. The traditional disease detection methods for tomato crops could not produce the expected outcome and the detection period for diseases was slow. The early detection of diseases can give better results than the existing detection models. Thus, computer vision-based technology deep learning techniques could be implemented for earlier disease detection. This paper introduces a comprehensive analysis of the disease classification and detection techniques implied for tomato leaf disease identification. This paper also reviews the merits and drawbacks of the methodologies proposed. This paper finally proposes the early disease detection technique to identify tomato leaf disease using hybrid deep-learning architecture.",

Among the methods of plant diseases identification, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is the most popular one for its superior performance.

In this work, we propose a new method, namely PiTLiD, based on pretrained Inception-V3 convolutional neural network and transfer learning to identify plant leaf diseases from phenotype data of plant leaf with small sample size. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, the experiments on several datasets with small-scale samples were implemented. The results show that PiTLiD performs better than compared methods.

After rice and wheat, potato is the crop that is majorly consumed by a billion of people almost every day in the world. However, the quality and quantity of potato crop is degrading due to various fungal and bacterial diseases. Detecting diseases at an early stage is challenging task due to variations in environmental factors, plant species and plant disease symptoms. Most of the traditional techniques for disease identification are expensive, sample treatment, time consuming and required experienced personnel. In recent research, several machine learning techniques have been developed to recognize the potato leaf diseases. In this work, a multi-layer deep learning model for potato leaf disease detection is developed. In the first layer, the potato leaves features are extracted from the image of the potato plant using the image segmentation technique. At the second level, a new deep learning technique was developed using a convolutional neural network [CNN] to detect fungal and bacterial diseases of potatoes. The leaf disease dataset contains 2250 images collected in real time and from the database. A web-based application is also developed for the young farmers to identify the diseases without any experience so that the precise value of pesticides can be dispensed. The proposed deep learning techniques achieved 99.76% accuracy on potato disease identification.",

Therefore, precaution is necessary during the early stage to detect and cure the diseases that occurred on the leaves before the diseases spread to result in plant death. However, the detection method employed currently is inconsistent and inefficient. Most farmers employ manual visualisations to identify the types of plant diseases as the automatic monitoring and classification of diseases cannot be achieved. Such obstacles drive the need for a plant disease detection system, aided by artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, in this work, four different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for tomato plant diseases detection, namely VGG-16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121 and ResNet-101 were implemented and the hyperparameters were manipulated for parametric studies. The performance of the different architectures with the selected hyperparameters was evaluated and compared according to the well-established evaluation metrics for deep learning; Precision, Recall, F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and Accuracy. Combining all its merits, the ResNet-50 model which had achieved an accuracy of 100% with a shorter training time was proposed as the final model to be implemented in the tomato plant diseases classification system. In short, a CNN model that is capable of effective classification of tomato leaf diseases has been developed and its benefits for tomato cultivation are much anticipated.",

            "title": "A Two-stage Approach for Plant Disease Classification Based on Deep Neural Networks and Transfer Learning",
            "abstract": "In recent times, drastic changes in the climate have brought about a dramatic increase in the prevalence of crop diseases. Such diseases are a huge threat to sustainable agriculture, especially for third-world countries whose economies still rely much on agriculture. Proper disease detection is an essential prerequisite to get timely treatment of crops and prevent reduction in crop yield. In most plant diseases, the leaves may contain some texture variations, which may help in identifying the diseases. However, an identical disease may not appear in a similar fashion for different plant species and visible texture differences may be very negligible. In most cases, plant diseases are classified for all species together, which may miss the species-specific symptoms. In this paper, we propose a two-stage classification scheme to classify plant diseases that divides the whole classification pipeline into two parts: a plant species detection part and a subsequent species-specific disease detection part. In both stages, we employ some efficient deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, namely EfficeintNetB3, NASNetLarge, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, VGG16 and InceptionV3 with effective transfer learning. Two publicly available datasets, namely Plant Village and IPM, are considered in this paper. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed two-stage method can perform better than the conventional single-stage methods reported in the literature for plant disease detection.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture is the backbone of many economies throughout the world including Pakistan. Similarly, tomatoes are the most widely cultivated vegetables in the agricultural field. In addition, the tropical weather increases the throughput yield of tomato crops. However, various climatic conditions and other factors affect the growth of the tomato plant. Rather than such climate conditions and natural disasters, plant diseases are the primary reason for the production crisis resulting in less tomato yield and financial disaster. Traditional methods for detecting diseases in tomato leaves failed to produce the expected outcomes, and disease detection seemed static. However, making the vegetable plants healthy with time is becoming very significant. Identifying diseases in vegetable plants is essential before they cause too severe harm to the vegetables. This research proposes three CNN-based models VGG-16, ResNet-152, and EfficientNet-B4, to classify tomato leaf diseases into normal of disease affected. The proposed research is conducted to find the best possible solution for detecting tomato leaf disease using these deep learning approaches. Employing the Plant-Village dataset with 5524 leaf images, ResNet-152 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved 93.75% and 97.27% accuracy respectively, while VGG-16 achieved 98% accuracy. The efficiency of the system makes it capable of becoming a preference in the agricultural field for real-time tomato leave disease detection applications.",

Hence, there is a strong need for the early diagnosis of the disease. The effectiveness of deep learning techniques in pattern matching and image processing motivated the authors to design an automatic tool for the detection of diseases in bell pepper plants. In this manuscript, the authors present the comparative analysis of different deep learning models applied for plant disease classification. They applied the deep learning models namely VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet121 on the publicly available dataset of the bell pepper plant. The experimental results prove that the model ‘DenseNet’ requires less training time and gives the highest validation accuracy among all the above-stated models. It achieves a training accuracy of 97.49% and the testing accuracy of 96.87% in classifying the bell pepper plants into healthy and diseased categories.",

            "abstract": "Pine wood nematode disease is a devastating pine disease that poses a great threat to forest ecosystems. The use of remote sensing methods can achieve macroscopic and dynamic detection of this disease; however, the efficiency and accuracy of traditional remote sensing image recognition methods are not always sufficient for disease detection. Deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs), a technology that has emerged in recent years, have an excellent ability to learn massive, high-dimensional image features and have been widely studied and applied in classification, recognition, and detection tasks involving remote sensing images. This paper uses Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing images of areas with pine wood nematode disease to construct a D-CNN sample dataset, and we train five popular models (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, SqueezeNet, ResNet-18, and VGG16) through transfer learning. Finally, we use the “macroarchitecture combined with micromodules for joint tuning and improvement” strategy to improve the model structure. The results show that the transfer learning effect of SqueezeNet on the sample dataset is better than that of other popular models and that a batch size of 64 and a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 are suitable for SqueezeNet’s transfer learning on the sample dataset. The improvement of SqueezeNet’s fire module structure by referring to the Slim module structure can effectively improve the recognition efficiency of the model, and the accuracy can reach 94.90%. The final improved model can help users accurately and efficiently conduct remote sensing monitoring of pine wood nematode disease.",

Early detection of these diseases can positively affect the harvest, and thus farmers would have to be knowledgeable about the various disease and how to identify them visually. Even then, it is an impossible task for farmers to survey the vast farmlands on a daily basis. Even if this is possible, it becomes a costly task that will, in turn, increases the price of rice for consumers. Machine learning algorithms fitted to drone technology combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) can offer a solution to this problem. In this paper, we propose a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) transfer learning-based approach for the accurate detection and classification of rice leaf disease. The modified proposed approach includes a modified VGG19-based transfer learning method. The proposed modified system can accurately detect and diagnose six distinct classes: healthy, narrow brown spot, leaf scald, leaf blast, brown spot, and bacterial leaf blight. The highest average accuracy is 96.08% using the non-normalized augmented dataset. The corresponding precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score were 0.9620, 0.9617, 0.9921, and 0.9616, respectively. The proposed modified approach achieved significantly better results compared with similar approaches using the same dataset or similar-size datasets reported in the extant literature.",

This will cause serious obstacles to the power generation of photovoltaic systems. Therefore, the immediate diagnosis and elimination of the fault of the photovoltaic system is the guarantee for the stable operation of the photovoltaic system. To address these issues, this paper makes contribution in the following Three aspects: (1) Building a 4×3 PV array model based on the key points and model parameters extracted from PV array by using Matlab, an efficient feature vector of five dimensions is proposed as the input of the fault diagnosis model; (2) The probabilistic neural network (PNN) is proposed as the fault classification tools, and achieving a good classification effect by using the simulated data after normalization to classify; (3) Performing the field test and inputting the experimental data into PNN for classification, with an accuracy of 97%. Both the simulation and experimental results show that the PNN can achieve high accuracy classification, provide a more favorable premise basis for the intelligent classification of faults in photovoltaic arrays.",

Can we say that some of them are better than others, or, ideally, choose one measure that is best in all situations? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic analysis of classification performance measures: we formally define a list of desirable properties and theoretically analyze which measures satisfy which properties. We also prove an impossibility theorem: some desirable properties cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Finally, we propose a new family of measures satisfying all desirable properties except one. This family includes the Matthews Correlation Coefficient and a so-called Symmetric Balanced Accuracy that was not previously used in classification literature. We believe that our systematic approach gives an important tool to practitioners for adequately evaluating classification results.",

            "abstract": "The process of medical diagnosis of leukemia cases is a complex process and requires diligent efforts. It is done by examining samples under a microscope and distinguishing the number, shape, size, and morphological features of white blood cells. This process takes a long time to predict leukemia. The professional skills and experience of the pathologist may also influence this procedure as a large number of overlapping structures and conditions, distractions, fatigue, and limitations in the human visual system can lead to an inappropriate diagnosis. Machine and deep learning approaches have been found to be effective strategies for enhancing the precision and efficiency of diagnosis and classification of medical images, including those of microscopic blood cells. In this paper, we will review the recent studies of leukemia detection and/or classification in the period of (2015 - 2023) in machine and deep learning and the combining of them. The review of these schemes is carried out in a systematic manner. In order to achieve the desired objective, segmentation schemes can be classified into four main categories: supervised machine learning techniques, unsupervised machine learning techniques, deep learning approaches, and traditional image processing techniques. Classification approaches can be categorized into three main groups: classical machine learning, deep learning, and a combination of both. CNN-based categorization systems can be further classified into three categories: conventional CNN, transfer learning, and additional developments in CNN. This paper also provides a concise analysis of these strategies and their significance in the categorization of leukemia. Ultimately, a comprehensive examination is conducted to elucidate the current state of research in this particular domain.",

        "abstract": "The economic health of a nation is significantly influenced by the productivity of its agricultural sector. Enhancing this productivity is directly linked to the early detection and management of plant diseases. Automated classification methodologies are instrumental in the early diagnosis of these diseases, offering improved precision over traditional methods. These automated systems initiate disease detection as soon as symptoms begin to manifest on plant leaves, following a four-step process involving pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In this study, we present an automated methodology for the detection and classification of plant diseases using a deep-learning approach applied to varying quality leaf images. A deep convolutional neural network architecture was trained utilizing an image dataset. The proposed Deep Neural Network Plant Disease Classifier (DNN-PDC) was specifically designed for the multi-categorization of plant diseases. Tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset on Kaggle were selected for the experiments. The proposed deep learning system demonstrated a high level of accuracy in the classification of various tomato leaf diseases, including Early Blight, Septoria Leaf Spot, and Late Blight. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses existing approaches in the image-based classification of tomato plant diseases. This study underscores the potential of the DNN-PDC model as a highly effective tool for plant disease detection and classification.",

            "abstract": "Early recognition of citrus diseases is important for preventing crop losses and employing timely disease control measures in farms. Employing machine learning-based approaches, such as deep learning for accurate detection of multiple citrus diseases is challenging due to the limited availability of labeled diseased samples. Further, a lightweight architecture with low computational complexity is required to perform citrus disease classification on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones. This enables practical utility of the architecture to perform effective monitoring of diseases by farmers using their own mobile devices in the farms. Hence, we propose a lightweight, fast, and accurate deep metric learning-based architecture for citrus disease detection from sparse data. In particular, we propose a patch-based classification network that comprises an embedding module, a cluster prototype module, and a simple neural network classifier, to detect the citrus diseases accurately. Evaluation of our proposed approach using publicly available citrus fruits and leaves dataset reveals its efficiency in accurately detecting the various diseases from leaf images. Further, the generalization capability of our approach is demonstrated using another dataset, namely the tea leaves dataset. Comparison analysis of our approach with existing state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate its superiority in terms of detection accuracy (95.04%), the number of parameters required for tuning (less than 2.3 M), and the time efficiency in detecting the citrus diseases (less than 10 ms) using the trained model. Moreover, the ability to learn with fewer resources and without compromising accuracy empowers the practical utility of the proposed scheme on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones.",

It can be identified as brown/tan coloured circular spots/lesions distributed unevenly on the leaf of the plant. A proper detection of the disease is required which can be further helpful in taking active measures like Spraying of Fungicides, Pruning, etc. can be done on time. The PlantVillage Dataset is used, which contains images of grape plant leaves affected from Block Rot Disease as well as the pictures of healthy leaves. HSV and L*a*b* colour models are used for the segmentation purposes. The healthy part and the diseased part of the leaves are separated using colour-based techniques and the features are stored for each leaf. The color of diseased part is very much different from the healthy part of the leaves which makes it easier to detect the disease on the basis of color. The machine learning is done using the Support Vector Machine Classifier and the results are analysed on different Kernels of SVM. The highest accuracy achieved is 94.1%.",

Moreover, they are able to cover large areas in a matter of a few minutes. Due to the impressive technological advancement, UAV-based remote sensing technologies are increasingly used to collect valuable data that could be used to achieve many precision agriculture applications, including crop/plant classification. In order to process these data accurately, we need powerful tools and algorithms such as Deep Learning approaches. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has emerged as a powerful tool for image processing tasks achieving remarkable results making it the state-of-the-art technique for vision applications. In the present study, we reviewed the recent CNN-based methods applied to the UAV-based remote sensing image analysis for crop/plant classification to help researchers and farmers to decide what algorithms they should use accordingly to their studied crops and the used hardware. Fusing different UAV-based data and deep learning approaches have emerged as a powerful tool to classify different crop types accurately. The readers of the present review could acquire the most challenging issues facing researchers to classify different crop types from UAV imagery and their potential solutions to improve the performance of deep learning-based algorithms.",

As a result, scientists in the field are on the lookout for efficient tools that can accurately diagnose and categorize a wide range of plant illnesses. Plant disease analysis and classification can be difficult owing to the wide variety of illnesses and farming environments. The purpose of this research is to use ensemble classification to quickly and accurately categorize 14 different types of tomato disease seen in both field and lab settings. Because of this, the ensemble classifiers have been developed utilizing diverse approaches to preparation, feature extraction, and classifications. Then, to choose the best ensemble classifiers, we compared the performance of these various ensemble approaches. The precision and reliability of the suggested technique were tested in both controlled laboratory settings and real-world scenarios using two databases: Plantvillage as well as Taiwan tomato leaves. Shadow, brightness fluctuations, illness similarities, background clutter, numerous leaves, and diverse textures were all considered by the top ensemble classifier, which achieved 96% accuracy. In addition, proposed ensemble models were presented and associated to the various Deep learning approaches. Further, the suggested strategy outperformed the most recent state-of-the-art Deep learning technique.",

        "abstract": ": Agriculture plays a crucial role in the economic development of many countries and sustains the global population despite facing various challenges like climate change, pollinator decline, and plant diseases. These threats to food security highlight the need for innovative solutions to prevent crop loss. Leveraging smartphone technology for automated image recognition-based disease diagnosis has emerged as a promising approach, thanks to their computing power and high-resolution cameras. To address this issue, we have focused on deep learning-based image detection techniques to identify plant diseases using the \"PlantVillage\" dataset. Several deep learning architectures, including AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, were employed and trained using two approaches: 'Training from scratch' and 'transfer learning’. The results of the analysis reveal GoogLeNet architecture achieved the highest accuracy of 0.999 for color images and 0.996 for segmented images, whereas InceptionV3 trained from scratch gave the highest accuracy of 0.994 for grayscale images with a train-test ratio of 90:10. All the models trained from scratch achieved the maximum F1-score of 1.0 for color and segmented images whereas for grayscale images, GoogleNet and InceptionV3 achieved the highest F1-score of 0.999 with train-test ratio 90:10. These findings indicate the potential of deep learning methods in detecting and diagnosing plant diseases, which can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of disease diagnosis processes in agriculture. Further research and improvements in image recognition techniques can lead to more robust and effective solutions for securing global food production.",

            "abstract": "Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

        "title": "Smart Diagnosis of Rose Leaf Diseases using Advanced Image Processing and Machine Learning",
        "abstract": "Roses, as one of the most widely cultivated ornamental flowers, hold significant aesthetic and economic value globally. However, their susceptibility to various foliar diseases presents major challenges to sustainable floriculture, impacting both crop quality and growers’ livelihoods. Conventional disease detection methods are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and dependent on expert intervention. To address these limitations, this study introduces a smart and automated framework for the early detection and classification of rose leaf diseases using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. A comprehensive dataset comprising images of both healthy and diseased rose leaves was curated, covering various disease types and severity levels. Image preprocessing steps—such as contrast enhancement, segmentation, and noise reduction—were implemented to optimize feature extraction. The system utilizes a hybrid classification approach by integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to enhance accuracy, generalizability, and robustness across diverse visual patterns. \nExperimental results demonstrate high classification performance, with the hybrid model outperforming individual classifiers in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed system enables real-time, scalable, and precise rose disease identification, making it a valuable tool for floriculturists, researchers, and precision agriculture practitioners. In future research, the model can be extended to support a wider variety of ornamental plants and additional plant parts such as stems and petals",

Farmers traditionally identify diseases by speaking with regional experts and conducting additional experiments. Farmers may find it challenging to comprehend the current situation given the prevalence of new diseases. India suffers 15% of the world’s annual agricultural losses, which is significant. To stop further crop damage, automated disease detection using machine learning and the cloud is crucial. The existing machine learning models in this proposal lacked sophistication, reliability, portability, and ease of use in some respects, making it cumbersome for others to actually examine the results in real time. In this proposal, by using Amazon’s cloud service AWS (Amazon web Services) to implement the proposal and host the website via the cloud, a farmer can take a picture of a leaf and send it to the users of the website. It can apply it to interface uploads to learn how it works.

        "abstract": "Plant leaf disease is a serious issue in agriculture worldwide. Image processing-based leaf disease detection and diagnosis approaches are becoming popular. The distinguishable features of leaf image are important to improve the performance of disease detection and diagnosis model. However, proper segmentation of the diseased part of a leaf helps to extract discriminant features. From this point of view, this paper presents an efficient leaf disease diagnosis model, where discriminant features are extracted from disease segmented leaf images using optimal segmentation algorithms. In this paper, the disease and healthy parts of the leaf are separated using segmentation techniques. After that, different distinguishable features are extracted based on color and intensity value of image pixels of leaf image. Finally, the Multiclass Support vector machine (MC-SVM) with RBF Gaussian kernel is used for detecting and diagnosis the leaf disease. To validate the proposed model, an online benchmarked leaf images dataset named \"PlantVillage-Dataset\" is used. The performance evaluation of the proposed model shows a satisfactory result of disease detection performance. Moreover, three well-known image segmentation algorithms are used and an optimal segmentation method is investigated to find better accuracy of disease diagnosis. According to the experimental result, the optimal results are observed for the leaf disease diagnosis using the Otsu thresholding-based disease segmentation.",

        "abstract": "In the agriculture sector, plants illnesses that cause crop destruction are to blame for financial losses. Whereas pesticides have been employed to alter agricultural yield, their excessive usage has a detrimental impact on the ecosystem. Determining the need for pesticides depends significantly on the ability to identify illnesses and distinguish them from nutritious deficiencies. The traditional approaches to identifying plant diseases need lengthy, laborious chemical procedures to be completed in a lab. Using machine learning and image processing techniques, this research describes an autonomous method for identifying & categorizing plants diseases. For algorithms training, the features separation technique is used on pictures. To determine which Machines Learning method is most suitable for identifying diseases, the performance of several techniques is assessed using training data. Unseen photographs are contained in the test folder, which is used to verify the system's effectiveness at identifying plant illnesses. Large numbers of photos may be used to train the system, which produces correct results more quickly. Agricultural illnesses are a danger to global agricultural security; however, it is still challenging to rapidly diagnose them since the required infrastructure is lacking in many regions of the world. Since the introduction of exact techniques, impressive accomplishments have been made within the area of categorizing images of leaves. This article makes use of Random Forest to discriminate between healthy and diseased leaves using the obtained data sets. Our plan calls for the creation of the dataset, features extraction, classifiers training, and categorization as execution activities. Ill and healthy leaf datasets were developed, and Random Forest was used to merge and train the datasets to categorize photographs of sick and healthy leaves. In conclusion, by employing machine learning to learn from those enormous data sets that are freely accessible, we may clearly detect the sickness existing in plants on a large scale.",

Although independence is generally a poor assumption, in practice naive Bayes often competes well with more sophisticated classiﬁers. Our broad goal is to understand the data characteristics which affect the performance of naive Bayes. Our approach uses Monte Carlo simulations that allow a systematic study of classiﬁcation accuracy for several classes of randomly generated problems. We analyze the impact of the distribution entropy on the classiﬁcation error, showing that low-entropy feature distributions yield good performance of naive Bayes. We also demonstrate that naive Bayes works well for certain nearly-functional feature dependencies, thus reaching its best performance in two opposite cases: completely independent features (as expected) and functionally dependent features (which is surprising). Another surprising result is that the accuracy of naive Bayes is not directly correlated with the degree of feature dependencies measured as the class-conditional mutual information between the features. Instead, a better predictor of naive Bayes accuracy is the amount of information about the class that is lost because of the independence assumption.",

        "abstract": "The timely and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases is what determines the efficiency of farming and food security in the world. In the situation of tomato cultivation, diseases like tomato spot, wilt, blight, and rot are the ones that cause a lot of damage to the yield and quality. This paper presents a new hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and random forest (RF) for the effective and accurate classification of tomato diseases. The model uses the CNN deep learning capabilities for feature extraction from photos of the tomato leaves and then utilizes RF robust classification for differentiating between four major disease categories and healthy ones. Our approach includes data collection and preprocessing, design and training of model architecture, and performance evaluation through various metrics. The hybrid model has been rigorously assessed on a dataset containing images of diseased and healthy tomato leaves, all in all yielding an impressive overall accuracy of 97.03%. This framework not only expresses the utility of this model as a trustworthy instrument for agricultural disease management, but it also clearly surpasses other models in the field. The results of the study emphasize the advantage of CNN and RF integration, which confirm higher performance in terms of disease classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The success of the hybrid model leads to an exploration of the potential role of artificial intelligence for farmers in agriculture, as it demonstrates a promising way to tackle the existing challenges of plant disease detection and classification. By its high accuracy and stable performance, this model is an important part of creating smart and automated agricultural diagnostic systems, which directly leads to enhanced disease management, increased crop yields, and sustainable agriculture.",

When the plant is under external stress, the trichomes can play an important role in protecting the plant from damage through its physical structure. The density and type of different trichomes are closely related to the stress resistance of tomatoes. The tomato wo mutant LA3186 (referred to herein as “3186M”), LA3186 (referred to herein as “3186L”), the ln mutant LA3-071 (referred to herein as “3-071”), and the tomato cultivar Jia Ren (referred to herein as “JR”, used as the control), which possess different numbers of trichomes on the surface of the leaves, were used as materials; the glandular characteristics, types, and densities of the trichomes were observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM); and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the subcellular structure in the leaves. The relationship between the different tomato trichomes and stress resistance was investigated with treatments of low temperature, drought, disease, and insects. This study provides a theoretical foundation and practical basis for the further utilization and regulation of the trichome-related characteristics of tomatoes.",

            "abstract": "Tomato production can be greatly reduced due to various diseases, such as bacterial spot, early blight, and leaf mold. Rapid recognition and timely treatment of diseases can minimize tomato production loss. Nowadays, a large number of researchers (including different institutes, laboratories, and universities) have developed and examined various traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for plant disease classification. However, through pass survey analysis, we found that there are no studies comparing the classification performance of ML and DL for the tomato disease classification problem. The performance and outcomes of different traditional ML and DL (a subset of ML) methods may vary depending on the datasets used and the tasks to be solved. This study generally aimed to identify the most suitable ML/DL models for the PlantVillage tomato dataset and the tomato disease classification problem. For machine learning algorithm implementation, we used different methods to extract disease features manually. In our study, we extracted a total of 52 texture features using local binary pattern (LBP) and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) methods and 105 color features using color moment and color histogram methods. Among all the feature extraction methods, the COLOR+GLCM method obtained the best result. By comparing the different methods, we found that the metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) of the tested deep learning networks (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet34, EfficientNet-b0, and MobileNetV2) were all better than those of the measured machine learning algorithms (support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and random forest (RF)). Furthermore, we found that, for our dataset and classification task, among the tested ML/DL algorithms, the ResNet34 network obtained the best results, with accuracy of 99.7%, precision of 99.6%, recall of 99.7%, and F1 score of 99.7%.",

The proposed approach achieves high accuracy in detecting and classifying the severity levels of the disease. Our findings suggest that the proposed method is successful in properly identifying and categorizing the illness severity levels, with an accuracy rate of 91.77% overall.

We utilize a CNN model that is built on the ResNet architecture, ensuring professional and accurate results. Through the utilization of this model, our objective is to effectively classify and detect diseases in potato leaves, enabling the implementation of timely and efficient disease management strategies. The dataset contains images of healthy leaves as well as leaves that have been infected with various diseases, including early blight and late blight. The model is then utilized to categorize new images of potato leaves as either healthy or diseased. The proposed approach demonstrates a high level of accuracy, achieving 97.9% in the classification of potato leaf diseases, including early blight potato leaf disease and late blight potato leaf disease",

Due to pest attack, nearly 18% of crop yield is lost in worldwide during every year. Identification of plant disease is difficult in manually but which is a key factor to preventing the losses. In existing, a module is applied in a farm, that contains large number of different sensors and also a device is used for converting and transfer data for monitoring and controlling purposes.

Texture analysis such as segmentation and classification plays a vital role in computer vision and pattern recognition and is widely applied to many areas such as industrial automation , bio-medical image processing and remote sensing. Now a day’s pollution is increasing day to day. classification of polluted leaves essential for some applications. To get the leaf based features image processing techniques are applied on the image of leaf. So texture features like mean, median ,skewness, kurtosis,GLCM and RMS of polluted leaves are published in this Article .Not only that Histogram of polluted leaves were published. Histograms of polluted leaves compared with data distribution measures like skewness and kurtosis.Manual polluted leafs identification task is time consuming process. Automatic detection of pollutant leaves is an active research topic now a days. Automatic polluted leaf identification will save time.In this paper histograms of nearly 30 polluted leafs of seven statistical measures were published.",

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21:2% top-1 and 5:6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3:5% top-5 error and 17:3% top-1 error on the validation set and 3:6% top-5 error on the official test set.",

This study introduces an AI-based system for the automatic diagnosis of urban street plants using video footage obtained with accessible camera devices. The system aims to monitor plant health on a day-to-day basis, aiding in the control of disease spreading in urban areas. By combining two machine vision algorithms, YOLOv8 and DeepSORT, the system efficiently identifies and tracks individual leaves, extracting the optimal images for health analysis. YOLOv8, chosen for its speed and computational efficiency, locates leaves, while DeepSORT ensures robust tracking in complex environments. For detailed health assessment, DeepLabV3Plus, a convolutional neural network, is employed to segment and quantify leaf damage caused by bacteria, pests, and fungi. The hybrid system, named Plant Doctor, has been trained and validated using a diverse dataset including footage from Tokyo urban plants. The results demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the system in diagnosing leaf damage, with potential applications in large scale urban flora illness monitoring. This approach provides a non-invasive, efficient, and scalable solution for urban tree health management, supporting sustainable urban ecosystems.",

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 99.35% on a held-out test set, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach.

            "abstract": "Machine-learning technology powers many aspects of modern society: from web searches to content filtering on social networks to recommendations on e-commerce websites, and it is increasingly present in consumer products such as cameras and smartphones. Machine-learning systems are used to identify objects in images, transcribe speech into text, match news items, posts or products with users’ interests, and select relevant results of search. Increasingly, these applications make use of a class of techniques called deep learning. Conventional machine-learning techniques were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form. For decades, constructing a pattern-recognition or machine-learning system required careful engineering and considerable domain expertise to design a feature extractor that transformed the raw data (such as the pixel values of an image) into a suitable internal representation or feature vector from which the learning subsystem, often a classifier, could detect or classify patterns in the input. Representation learning is a set of methods that allows a machine to be fed with raw data and to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification. Deep-learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. With the composition of enough such transformations, very complex functions can be learned. For classification tasks, higher layers of representation amplify aspects of the input that are important for discrimination and suppress irrelevant variations. An image, for example, comes in the form of an array of pixel values, and the learned features in the first layer of representation typically represent the presence or absence of edges at particular orientations and locations in the image. The second layer typically detects motifs by spotting particular arrangements of edges, regardless of small variations in the edge positions. The third layer may assemble motifs into larger combinations that correspond to parts of familiar objects, and subsequent layers would detect objects as combinations of these parts. The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers of features are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure. Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for many years. It has turned out to be very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data and is therefore applicable to many domains of science, business and government. In addition to beating records in image recognition and speech recognition, it has beaten other machine-learning techniques at predicting the activity of potential drug molecules, analysing particle accelerator data, reconstructing brain circuits, and predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding DNA on gene expression and disease. Perhaps more surprisingly, deep learning has produced extremely promising results for various tasks in natural language understanding, particularly topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering and language translation. We think that deep learning will have many more successes in the near future because it requires very little engineering by hand, so it can easily take advantage of increases in the amount of available computation and data. New learning algorithms and architectures that are currently being developed for deep neural networks will only accelerate this progress.",

Deep learning, the latest breakthrough in computer vision, is promising for fine-grained disease severity classification, as the method avoids the labor-intensive feature engineering and threshold-based segmentation. Using the apple black rot images in the PlantVillage dataset, which are further annotated by botanists with four severity stages as ground truth, a series of deep convolutional neural networks are trained to diagnose the severity of the disease. The performances of shallow networks trained from scratch and deep models fine-tuned by transfer learning are evaluated systemically in this paper. The best model is the deep VGG16 model trained with transfer learning, which yields an overall accuracy of 90.4% on the hold-out test set. The proposed deep learning model may have great potential in disease control for modern agriculture.",

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.",

            "abstract": "The rapid development of light detection and ranging (Lidar) provides a promising way to obtain three-dimensional (3D) phenotype traits with its high ability of recording accurate 3D laser points. Recently, Lidar has been widely used to obtain phenotype data in the greenhouse and field with along other sensors. Individual maize segmentation is the prerequisite for high throughput phenotype data extraction at individual crop or leaf level, which is still a huge challenge. Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning method, has shown high performance in object detection, classification, and segmentation. In this study, we proposed a method to combine deep leaning and regional growth algorithms to segment individual maize from terrestrial Lidar data. The scanned 3D points of the training site were sliced row and row with a fixed 3D window. Points within the window were compressed into deep images, which were used to train the Faster R-CNN (region-based convolutional neural network) model to learn the ability of detecting maize stem. Three sites of different planting densities were used to test the method. Each site was also sliced into many 3D windows, and the testing deep images were generated. The detected stem in the testing images can be mapped into 3D points, which were used as seed points for the regional growth algorithm to grow individual maize from bottom to up. The results showed that the method combing deep leaning and regional growth algorithms was promising in individual maize segmentation, and the values of r, p, and F of the three testing sites with different planting density were all over 0.9. Moreover, the height of the truly segmented maize was highly correlated to the manually measured height (R2> 0.9). This work shows the possibility of using deep leaning to solve the individual maize segmentation problem from Lidar data.",

            "title": "Early recognition of tomato gray leaf spot disease based on MobileNetv2-YOLOv3 model",
            "abstract": "Background Tomato gray leaf spot is a worldwide disease, especially in warm and humid areas. The continuous expansion of greenhouse tomato cultivation area and the frequent introduction of foreign varieties in recent years have increased the severity of the epidemic hazards of this disease in some tomato planting bases annually. This disease is a newly developed one. Thus, farmers generally lack prevention and control experience and measures in production; the disease is often misdiagnosed or not prevented and controlled timely; this condition results in tomato production reduction or crop failure, which causes severe economic losses to farmers. Therefore, tomato gray leaf spot disease should be identified in the early stage, which will be important in avoiding or reducing the economic loss caused by the disease. The advent of the era of big data has facilitated the use of machine learning method in disease identification. Therefore, deep learning method is proposed to realise the early recognition of tomato gray leaf spot. Tomato growers need to develop the app of image detection mobile terminal of tomato gray leaf spot disease to realise real-time detection of this disease. Results This study proposes an early recognition method of tomato leaf spot based on MobileNetv2-YOLOv3 model to achieve a good balance between the accuracy and real-time detection of tomato gray leaf spot. This method improves the accuracy of the regression box of tomato gray leaf spot recognition by introducing the GIoU bounding box regression loss function. A MobileNetv2-YOLOv3 lightweight network model, which uses MobileNetv2 as the backbone network of the model, is proposed to facilitate the migration to the mobile terminal. The pre-training method combining mixup training and transfer learning is used to improve the generalisation ability of the model. The images captured under four different conditions are statistically analysed. The recognition effect of the models is evaluated by the F1 score and the AP value, and the experiment is compared with Faster-RCNN and SSD models. Experimental results show that the recognition effect of the proposed model is significantly improved. In the test dataset of images captured under the background of sufficient light without leaf shelter, the F1 score and AP value are 94.13% and 92.53%, and the average IOU value is 89.92%. In all the test sets, the F1 score and AP value are 93.24% and 91.32%, and the average IOU value is 86.98%. The object detection speed can reach 246 frames/s on GPU, the extrapolation speed for a single 416 × 416 picture is 16.9 ms, the detection speed on CPU can reach 22 frames/s, the extrapolation speed is 80.9 ms and the memory occupied by the model is 28 MB. Conclusions The proposed recognition method has the advantages of low memory consumption, high recognition accuracy and fast recognition speed. This method is a new solution for the early prediction of tomato leaf spot and a new idea for the intelligent diagnosis of tomato leaf spot.",

            "abstract": "Melanoma is one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths. The development of new computational methods as an important tool for assisting doctors can lead to early diagnosis and effectively reduce mortality. In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network architecture for melanoma diagnosis inspired by ensemble learning and genetic algorithms. The architecture is designed by a genetic algorithm that finds optimal members of the ensemble. Additionally, the abstract features of all models are merged and, as a result, additional prediction capabilities are obtained. The diagnosis is achieved by combining all individual predictions. In this manner, the training process is implicitly regularized, showing better convergence, mitigating the overfitting of the model, and improving the generalization performance. The aim is to find the models that best contribute to the ensemble. The proposed approach also leverages data augmentation, transfer learning, and a segmentation algorithm. The segmentation can be performed without training and with a central processing unit, thus avoiding a significant amount of computational power, while maintaining its competitive performance. To evaluate the proposal, an extensive experimental study was conducted on sixteen skin image datasets, where state-of-the-art models were significantly outperformed. This study corroborated that genetic algorithms can be employed to effectively find suitable architectures for the diagnosis of melanoma, achieving in overall 11% and 13% better prediction performances compared to the closest model in dermoscopic and non-dermoscopic images, respectively. Finally, the proposal was implemented in a web application in order to assist dermatologists and it can be consulted at http://skinensemble.com.",

            "abstract": "Smart agriculture today uses a wide range of wireless communication technologies. Low Power Consumption Embedded Devices (LPCED), such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks, make it possible to work over great distances at a reduced cost but with limited transferable data volumes. However, data management (DM) in intelligent agriculture is still not well understood due to the fact that there are not enough scientific publications available on this. Though data management (DM) benefits are factual and substantial, many challenges must be addressed in order to fully realize the DM’s potential. The main difficulties are data integration complexities, the lack of skilled personnel and sufficient resources, inadequate infrastructure, and insignificant data warehouse architecture. This work proposes a comprehensive architecture that includes big data technologies, IoT components, and knowledge-based systems. We proposed an AI-based architecture for smart farming. This architecture called, Smart Farming Oriented Big-Data Architecture (SFOBA), is designed to guarantee the system’s durability and the data modeling in order to transform the business needs for smart farming into analytics. Furthermore, the proposed solution is built on a pre-defined big data architecture that includes an abstraction layer of the data lake that handles data quality, following a data migration strategy in order to ensure the data’s insights.",

Deep learning models require a large amount of high-quality training data. However, collecting and managing large amounts of guaranteed-quality data is a critical issue. To meet these requirements, this study proposes a scalable plant disease information collection and management system (PlantInfoCMS). The proposed PlantInfoCMS consists of data collection, annotation, data inspection, and dashboard modules to generate accurate and high-quality pest and disease image datasets for learning purposes. Additionally, the system provides various statistical functions allowing users to easily check the progress of each task, making management highly efficient. Currently, PlantInfoCMS handles data on 32 types of crops and 185 types of pests and diseases, and stores and manages 301,667 original and 195,124 labeled images. The PlantInfoCMS proposed in this study is expected to significantly contribute to the diagnosis of crop pests and diseases by providing high-quality AI images for learning about and facilitating the management of crop pests and diseases.",

Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing have accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart farming though is hampered because of the lack of models providing guidance to practitioners regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT based monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing and implementing Smart farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference architecture model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement, the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies that incorporate the four layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor Layer, the Network Layer, the Service Layer and the Application Layer. A discussion is also conducted upon the challenges that smart farming monitoring systems face.",

In this chapter, an IoT-based crop disease management (CDM) system is proposed that adopts statistical methods for identifying disease, recognizing a right pesticide, and recommending a right pesticide to farmers. The proposed CDM system monitors the agricultural crops with the help of a CCD camera. The camera continuously photographs the crops and sends them to a Raspberry PI processor, which is placed at a workstation and it is connected to the camera with the help of IoT components. The proposed CDM system analyses the crop leaf images, such as removes noise; segments region of interest (RoI), that is, diseased part of the leaf image; extracts features from the RoI; and identifies the disease and takes appropriate measures to control the disease. The proposed IoT-based CDM system was experimented, and the results obtained encourage both the farmers and the researchers in this field.",

This necessitates access to efficient management systems to keep track of cross, performance, pedigree, geographical and image-based data, as well as genotyping data. In this article, we report the progress on the Breeding Information Management System (BIMS), a free, secure and online breeding management system that allows breeders to store, manage, archive and analyze their private breeding data. BIMS is the first publicly available database system that enables individual breeders to integrate their private phenotypic and genotypic data with public data and, at the same time, have complete control of their own breeding data along with access to tools such as data import/export, data analysis and data archiving. The integration of breeding data with publicly available genomic and genetic data enhances genetic understanding of important traits and maximizes the marker-assisted breeding utility for breeders and allied scientists. BIMS incorporates the use of the Android App Field Book, open-source phenotype data collection software for phones and tablets that allows breeders to replace hard copy field books, thus alleviating the possibility of transcription errors while providing faster access to the collected data. BIMS comes with training materials and support for individual or small group training and is currently implemented in the Genome Database for Rosaceae, CottonGEN, the Citrus Genome Database, the Pulse Crop Database, and the Genome Database for Vaccinium.

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective: The objective of this paper is to prepare the government and citizens of India to take or implement the control measures proactively to reduce the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Method: In this work, the COVID-19 outbreak in India has been predicted based on the pattern of China using a machine learning approach. The model is built to predict the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases based on the data available between January 22, 2020, and April 3, 2020. The time series forecasting method is used for prediction models. Results: The COVID-19 effects are predicted to be at peak between the third and fourth weeks of April 2020 in India. This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020. The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68 978, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around April 25, 2020, in India. If this outbreak is not controlled by the end of May 2020, then India will face a severe shortage of hospitals, and it will make this outbreak even worse. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic may be controlled if the Government of India takes proactive steps to aggressively implement a lockdown in the country and extend it further. This presented epidemiological model is an effort to predict the future forecast of COVID-19 spread, based on the present scenario, so that the government can frame policy decisions, and necessary actions can be initiated.",

If the other countries are taken into consideration, it can be easily concluded that potatoes are the number one vegetable all over the world, which has been increasingly claimed by many Agricultural departments. Despite the hype, potato leaf disease causes significant damage to the potatoes.. Various types of diseases such as early blight, late blight, septoria blight etc. will attack potato plants and exhibit their syndrome in the leaf of these disorders. The farmer would not face incurring major economic losses if these outbreaks are detected at the primary stage and sufficient action is taken. The proposed model will strongly identify and detect diseases of potato leaf stand on image processing methods in this research paper. Machine Learning includes several algorithms, but the CNN model is used for this research to detect the disease from images of the potato leaf because in CNN is used for image classification & it gives the best result than others. There are 5 algorithms is used for this research they are AlexNet, VggNet, ResNet, LeNet & Sequential model which is our offered one. Normal & disorder-impacted leaf were used for the model provided in order to segregate normal and abnormal aspects of potato leaf. Those kind of photographs are then analyzed through the algorithm provide & the potato plant leaf is labeled as either diseased or normal. This provided model established 97% of great precision.",

This sector faces predominant issues in recognizing crop infection, disease prediction, pest control, weed detection and yield prediction leading to the shortfall in both quality and production of food. To ensure food safety, high resilience and increased crop yields, the precise diagnosis and recognition of underlying plant disease along with classification of crops from weeds is vital. The recent advancements in automatic feature extraction and classification techniques using Artificial Intelligence have gained attraction in the field of agriculture and crop protection. This paper proposes a Novel Convolutional Neural Network model for crop disease classification. The model is trained and tested in publicly available Plant Village Dataset with 38 categories and 15 classes. For the experimental analysis, the model is trained with 5 classes which includes potato and pepper bell categories. Further, the performance of the proposed model is analyzed with machine leaning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighborhood (K-NN), Random Forest, Decision Tree and have attained the highest accuracy of 91.28%. In the testing phase, it is observed that this model is superior in terms of accuracy, specificity, precision, recall and F1-Score.",

        "abstract": "Sugarcane, a critical crop for sugar and biofuel production, is vulnerable to various diseases that can severely impact yields and profitability. Early and accurate disease detection is crucial for timely intervention and minimizing losses. This study presents a mobile application leveraging the power of Deep Learning to accurately identify sugarcane diseases directly from leaf images. This paper proposed a smart phone based application that uses Machine Learning aspects to identify Disease in Sugarcane plant from image. A convolutional neural network model that was trained on a large dataset of photos of sugarcane leaves in both healthy and diseased stages is used by the application. The model's mobile deployment optimization ensures quick and accurate disease prediction on user devices. The program offers an easy-to-use interface for taking pictures of leaves, which the trained CNN model subsequently processes and examines. The user is presented with pertinent disease information and suggested management strategies in addition to the projected disease category and confidence level. Sugarcane growers, extension agents, and farmars may find this user-friendly and easily accessible mobile application to be a useful tool for on-the-spot disease diagnosis, allowing prompt intervention and supporting the sustainable production of this essential commodity.",

Early stage plant disease identification is extremely important as that can adversely affect both quality and quantity of crops in agriculture. For identification of plant diseases, different approaches like image processing, machine learning, artificial neural networks, and deep learning are in use. This review focusses on an in-depth analysis on recently emerging deep learning-based methods starting from machine learning techniques. The paper highlights the crop diseases they focus on, the models employed, sources of data used and overall performance according to the performance metrics employed by each paper for plant disease identification. Review findings indicate that Deep Learning provides the highest accuracy, outperforming existing commonly used disease identification techniques and the main factors that affect the performance of deep learning-based tools. This paper is an attempt to document all such approaches for increasing performance accuracy and minimizing response time in the identification of plant diseases.

The limited performance of existing techniques in early detection is lack of localized information. We instead propose a dataset with annotations for each diseased segment in each image. Unlike existing approaches, instead of classifying images into either healthy or diseased, we propose to provide localized classification for each segment of an images. Our method is based on Mask RCNN and provides location as well as extend of infected regions on the plant. Thus the extend of damage on the crop can be estimated. Our method has obtained overall 87.6% accuracy on the proposed dataset as compared to 58.4% obtained without incorporating localized information.",

An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

We demonstrate a system capable of automatically identifying NLB lesions in field-acquired images of maize plants with high reliability. This approach uses a computational pipeline of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that addresses the challenges of limited data and the myriad irregularities that appear in images of field-grown plants. Several CNNs were trained to classify small regions of images as containing NLB lesions or not; their predictions were combined into separate heat maps, then fed into a final CNN trained to classify the entire image as containing diseased plants or not. The system achieved 96.7% accuracy on test set images not used in training. We suggest that such systems mounted on aerial- or ground-based vehicles can help in automated high-throughput plant phenotyping, precision breeding for disease resistance, and reduced pesticide use through targeted application across a variety of plant and disease categories.",

        "title": "ConvNeXt-based Mango Leaf Disease Detection: Differentiating Pathogens and Pests for Improved Accuracy",
        "abstract": "—Mango farming is a key economic activity in several locations across the world. Mango trees are prone to various diseases caused by viruses and pests, which can substantially impair crops and have an effect on farmers' revenue. To stop the spread of these illnesses and to lessen the crop damage they cause, early diagnosis of these diseases is essential. Growing interest has been shown in employing deep learning models to create automated disease detection systems for crops because of recent developments in machine learning. This research article includes a study on the application of ConvNeXt models for the diagnosis of pathogen and pest caused illnesses in mango plants. The study intends to investigate the variety in how these illnesses emerge on mango leaves and assess the efficiency of ConvNeXt models in identifying and categorizing them. Images of healthy mango leaves as well as the leaves with a variety of illnesses brought on by pathogens and pests are included in the dataset used in the study. In the study, deep learning models were applied to classify mango pests and pathogens. The models achieved high accuracy on both datasets, with better performance on the pathogen dataset. Larger models consistently outperformed smaller ones, indicating their ability to learn complex features. The ConvNeXtXLarge model showed the highest accuracy: 98.79% for mango pests, 100% for mango pathogens, and 99.17% for the combined dataset. This work holds significance for mango disease detection, aiding in efficient management and potential economic benefits for farmers. However, the models' performance can be influenced by dataset quality, preprocessing techniques, and hyperparameter selection.",

            "abstract": "The development of Integrated Pest Management on mango requires the knowledge of the main pests, their biological cycle and their relationships with mango. The objective of this study was to survey pests in mango orchards on Reunion Island and to rank them according to the severity of damage produced. As flowering is a key stage for mango production, a particular focus was made on pests affecting this stage of growth. Five orchards situated in three locations of the mango production area were monitored over a two-year period with visual assessment and the use of insect traps. The two main cultivars planted in Reunion Island are the Floridian cultivar 'Cogshall' and the local cultivar 'Jose'. The main phenological stages of the trees were recorded: vegetative growth, flowering and fruit maturity. Overall, thirteen pests were observed in mango orchards and six of them were of economic importance: three species of fruit flies, two gall midges and one bug. The blossom mango gall midge (Procontarinia mangiferae Felt) and the green bug (Orthops palus Taylor) primarily affect the flowering stage. The blossom mango gall midge is a mango-specific pest, of which larvae grow within the axis of inflorescence, whereas the green bug is a polyphagous non-specific pest, of which larvae and adults feed on inflorescences. Each of these species can destroy the inflorescences within a few days. Young bursting inflorescences are damaged more by the blossom mango gall midge, whereas mature flowering inflorescences are damaged by the green bug. This is the first report of damage on mango caused by this Miridae. The long duration of flowering in mango orchards contributes to maintaining high levels of these pest populations and is consequently a main drawback to control their populations and damage. Technical practices aimed at synchronizing flowering could be useful in controlling these pests without the use of pesticides. (Resume d'auteur)",

When diseases affect the mango plant there is significant decrease in the production of mango due to which farmers suffer in selling their yield. This problem motivated to develop the new techniques to detect and diagnose the diseases affecting the mango plant and devise the expert system to prevent those. To increase production and quality, it is very necessary to control all such harmful disease at the earlier stage. In our country most of the farmers are illiterate. So they cannot get correct information about disease. It requires an expert advisor or agricultural officer. But it is difficult for an expert advisor or an agricultural officer to reach at every farmer. In mentioned system For image enhancement “Imadjust” function is particularly used for contrast enhancement. This is a inbuilt function in MATLAB. Contrast enhanced is done by linearly scaling pixel values and features used are Contrast, Correlation, Energy, Entropy, Homogeneity, Cluster prominence,Cluster shade, Variance and Dissimilarity. Classifier used is SVM. The proposed system gives accuracy of 90% while testing on 92 samples.",

A pixel-based segmentation method for the estimation of flowering level from tree images was confounded by the developmental stage. Therefore, the use of a single and a two-stage deep learning framework (YOLO and R2CNN) was considered, using either upright or rotated bounding boxes. For a validation image set and for a total panicle count, the models MangoYOLO(-upright), MangoYOLO-rotated, YOLOv3-rotated, R2CNN(-rotated) and R2CNN-upright achieved weighted F1 scores of 76.5, 76.1, 74.9, 74.0 and 82.0, respectively. For a test set of the images of another cultivar and using a different camera, the R2 for machine vision to human count of panicles per tree was 0.86, 0.80, 0.83, 0.81 and 0.76 for the same models, respectively. Thus, there was no consistent benefit from the use of rotated over the use of upright bounding boxes. The YOLOv3-rotated model was superior in terms of total panicle count, and the R2CNN-upright model was more accurate for panicle stage classification. To demonstrate practical application, panicle counts were made weekly for an orchard of 994 trees, with a peak detection routine applied to document multiple flowering events.",

        "abstract": "In the dynamic field of agriculture, the intelligent diagnosis and classification of plant diseases represent a key research objective. Among widely cultivated fruits, apples are prominent, and diseases such as “Scab” and “Rust” are prevalent in apple plants. Differentiating between these diseases, as well as identifying “multiple diseases” and healthy apple leaves, poses a challenging task. To address this issue, this research proposes an advanced deep learning algorithm capable of accurately classifying and recognizing various apple leaf diseases with minimal loss. Utilizing the ‘Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7’ dataset with 1821 images categorized into Scab, Rust, Healthy, and Multiple diseases, our study embarks on an in-depth analysis of apple leaf conditions. Furthermore, the issue of imbalanced datasets is mitigated by implementing the SMOTE algorithm. To determine the optimal model, multiple approaches are explored, including modifying learning rate values, employing different batch sizes, and utilizing diverse optimizer functions. The study encompasses the application of both a simple CNN model and transfer learning models, such as DenseNet, InceptionV3, VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet101. Through extensive experimentation, it is revealed that the DenseNet model outperforms the others, achieving a remarkable validation accuracy of 97.18%, the findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms for revolutionizing apple disease detection, offering farmers and agriculturalists a reliable tool to combat plant diseases effectively.",

Early diagnosis and accurate identification of apple leaf diseases can control the spread of infection and ensure the healthy development of the apple industry. The existing research uses complex image preprocessing and cannot guarantee high recognition rates for apple leaf diseases. This paper proposes an accurate identifying approach for apple leaf diseases based on deep convolutional neural networks. It includes generating sufficient pathological images and designing a novel architecture of a deep convolutional neural network based on AlexNet to detect apple leaf diseases. Using a dataset of 13,689 images of diseased apple leaves, the proposed deep convolutional neural network model is trained to identify the four common apple leaf diseases. Under the hold-out test set, the experimental results show that the proposed disease identification approach based on the convolutional neural network achieves an overall accuracy of 97.62%, the model parameters are reduced by 51,206,928 compared with those in the standard AlexNet model, and the accuracy of the proposed model with generated pathological images obtains an improvement of 10.83%. This research indicates that the proposed deep learning model provides a better solution in disease control for apple leaf diseases with high accuracy and a faster convergence rate, and that the image generation technique proposed in this paper can enhance the robustness of the convolutional neural network model.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive dataset designed for the visual detection of crop diseases, comprising 43,267 images of 12 crop species across 15 disease classes. The dataset was developed over 14 months of dedicated human effort. To evaluate its effectiveness, several plant disease detection and classification algorithms were tested. The models generated by these algorithms were deployed on mobile devices and specialized hardware, enabling practical applications ranging from drones to Android smartphones, with on-device detection capabilities. \nThe results highlight the performance of deep learning techniques, with the YOLOv4 algorithm achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 71.04%, while the VGG model attained 92% precision and 90% accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning in enhancing crop monitoring, offering significant support for pest and disease control in vegetable crops. This work underscores the role of advanced technologies in promoting sustainable agricultural practices.",

            "abstract": "Individual pig tracking is key to stepping away from group-level treatment and towards individual pig care. By doing so we can monitor individual pig behaviour changes over time and use these as indicators of health and well-being, which, in turn, will assist in the early detection of disease allowing for earlier and more effective intervention. However, it is a much more computationally challenging than performing this task at group level; mistakes in identification and tracking accumulate and, over time, provide noise measures. We combine a deep CNN object localisation method, Faster Region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN), with two potential real-time multi-object tracking methods in order to create a complete system that can autonomously localise and track individual pigs allowing for the extraction of metrics pertaining to individual pig behaviours from RGB cameras. We evaluate two different transfer learning strategies to adapt Faster R-CNN to our pig detection dataset that is more challenging than conventional tracking benchmark datasets. We are able to localise pigs in individual frames with 0.901 mean average precision (mAP), which then allows us to track individual pigs across video footage with 92% Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and 73.4% Identity F1-Score (IDF1), and re-identify them after occlusions and dropped frames with 0.862 mAP (0.788 Rank 1 cumulative matching characteristic (CMC)). From these tracks we extract individual behavioural metrics for total distance travelled, time spent idle, and average speed with less than 0.015 mean squared error (MSE) for each. Changes in all these behavioural metrics have value in the detection of pig health and wellbeing.",

Producing more food while consuming fewer resources like water, fertilizers, and arable land is probably the most important. Today more than ever, farmers need specialized technological tools to achieve this goal. It is possible to improve agricultural processes by practicing technology-supported precision agriculture. However, more technology development to optimize crop yield is needed worldwide. In this research, we conducted a systematic literature review in which we studied different articles that propose optimization for agricultural processes. We identified some proposals made from multiple researchers at distinct latitudes, focused on optimizing the irrigation and management of pests and diseases. Nevertheless, there are only a few studies that focus on optimizing the crop yield. They do that by controlling the different factors that can affect it. We also found out that only a few studies have been conducted in the Latin American region. Thus, these findings show areas in which there is still a lot of opportunities to contribute to the agro sector in Latin American countries.",

It plays pivotal role on the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of any country. One way to increase the Agri-based GDP is to use Precision Agriculture (PA) whereby information technology is introduced into traditional agriculture. Agricultural expert systems have progressed from basic record keeping to large-scale farm management information systems (FMISs) that are utilized for crop prediction, crop disease detection, farm scheduling, and water monitoring. Precision Agriculture based framework allows us to use proper amount of water, fertilizers and seeds thereby, increasing the productivity of the agriculture fields by monitoring the environmental/soil parameters of agricultural land such as: pH, soil temperature, soil humidity, soil moisture and atmospheric pressure. In this paper an extensive literature review has been done on the architecture, hardware, communication protocol, and data acquisition infrastructure for crop monitoring systems along with the survey of different mobile applications and machine learning models used in precision agriculture.",

        "abstract": "Apple planting is an important part of China's agricultural economy. With the progress of computer technology, China, as the first apple planting country in the world, also needs to change to a digital and intelligent working mode. As apples are easy to be attacked by various diseases and pests during planting, and the early pathological changes mainly occur in leaves, especially mottle leaf disease, gray spot disease, rust and cedar rust. How to find these diseases in time and quickly make accurate classification is the key to subsequent treatment. In this paper, Based on the ResNet50 network architecture, the attention mechanism is added to design the new work model needed to improve the accuracy of disease identification. Aiming at the problem of small sample size of apple tree disease image dataset, we uses the idea of transfer learning to upgrade the network model training process. The network model is trained according to the set training strategy to increase the convergence speed and the working accuracy of the network model. Compared with other traditional classification methods, it is proved that the detection method based on ResNet50 network model in convolutional neural network is more effective.",

In this work, we introduce two new modules to enhance the transformation modeling capability of CNNs, namely, deformable convolution and deformable RoI pooling. Both are based on the idea of augmenting the spatial sampling locations in the modules with additional offsets and learning the offsets from the target tasks, without additional supervision. The new modules can readily replace their plain counterparts in existing CNNs and can be easily trained end-to-end by standard back-propagation, giving rise to deformable convolutional networks. Extensive experiments validate the performance of our approach. For the first time, we show that learning dense spatial transformation in deep CNNs is effective for sophisticated vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.",

We present a novel recurrent neural network model that is capable of extracting information from an image or video by adaptively selecting a sequence of regions or locations and only processing the selected regions at high resolution. Like convolutional neural networks, the proposed model has a degree of translation invariance built-in, but the amount of computation it performs can be controlled independently of the input image size. While the model is non-differentiable, it can be trained using reinforcement learning methods to learn task-specific policies. We evaluate our model on several image classification tasks, where it significantly outperforms a convolutional neural network baseline on cluttered images, and on a dynamic visual control problem, where it learns to track a simple object without an explicit training signal for doing so.",

        "abstract": "Agriculture crops are highly significant for the sustenance of human life and act as an essential source for national income development worldwide. Plant diseases and pests are considered one of the most imperative factors influencing food production, quality, and minimize losses in production. Farmers are currently facing difficulty in identifying various plant diseases and pests, which are important to prevent plant diseases effectively in a complicated environment. The recent development of deep learning techniques has found use in the diagnosis of plant diseases and pests, providing a robust tool with highly accurate results. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature that aims to identify the state of the art of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the process of diagnosing and identification of plant pest and diseases. In addition, it presents some issues that are facing the models performance, and also indicates gaps that should be addressed in the future. In this regard, we review studies with various methods that addressed plant disease detection, dataset characteristics, the crops, and pathogens. Moreover, it discusses the commonly employed five-step methodology for plant disease recognition, involving data acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. It discusses various deep learning architecture-based solutions that have a faster convergence rate of plant disease recognition. From this review, it is possible to understand the innovative trends regarding the use of CNN’s algorithms in the plant diseases diagnosis and to recognize the gaps that need the attention of the research community.",

        "abstract": "Plant pathogens and pests hinder general plant health, resulting in poor agricultural yields and production. These threaten global food security and cause environmental and economic shortages. Amidst the available existing heavy deep learning (DL) models, there is an increasing demand for computation resources, memory constraints, delayed interface time, unscalable deployment, increased training time, higher data requirements, and inflexibility. To solve all these challenges, this study presents a robust and lightweight “AgarwoodNet” DL model. The research introduces and uses a new raw curated Agarwood pest and disease dataset (APDD) with 14 classes and 5,472 Agarwood leaf images from Brunei and the Turkey Plant Pests and Diseases (TPPD) dataset with 4,447 images categorized into 15 diverse classes of six plants. MATLAB deep learning toolbox was used to train the DL architectures. The performance assessment parameters considered Cohen’s Kappa, specificity precision, F1 scores, and recall. The proposed AgarwoodNet achieved impressive Macro-average performance of 0.9666, 0.9714, and 0.9859 in Precision, Recall, and F1 Scores, respectively, and 0.9859 on Kappa when tested on APDD. More so, the model attained 95.85%, 96.13%, and 95.90% in testing using TPPD and 96.84% on Kappa with the model size of 37 megabytes, making it a lightweight model in relation to the pre-trained convolutional neural network a considerably heavy, others twice the proposed model. This model size is considerably light and can be implemented on low-memory devices, thus supporting sustainable agricultural applications that are precise and accurate in classifying and detecting plant diseases and diseases.

            "abstract": "The presence issue of inaccurate plant disease detection persists under real field conditions and most deep learning (DL) techniques still struggle to achieve real-time performance. Hence, challenges in choosing a suitable deep-learning technique to tackle the problem should be addressed. Plant diseases have a detrimental effect on agricultural yield, hence early detection is crucial to prevent food insecurity. To identify and categorise the indications of plant diseases, numerous developed or modified DL architectures are utilised. This paper aims to observe the performance of the YOLOv8 model, which has better performance than its predecessors, on a small-scale plant disease dataset. This paper also aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of plant disease detection and classification methods by proposing an optimised and lightweight YOLOv8 architecture model. It trains the YOLOv8 model on a public dataset and optimises the YOLOv8 algorithm with the integration of the GhostNet module into the backbone architecture to cut down the number of parameters for a faster computational algorithm. In addition, the architecture incorporates a Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism module, which further enhances the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the combination of YOLOv8s with CA mechanism and transfer learning obtained the best result, yielding score of 72.2% which surpassed the studies that utilised the same dataset. Without transfer learning, our best result is demonstrated by YOLOv8s with GhostNet and CA mechanism yielding a score of 69.3%.",

            "abstract": "Crop yield production could be enhanced for agricultural growth if various plant nutrition deficiencies, and diseases are identified and detected at early stages. Hence, continuous health monitoring of plant is very crucial for handling plant stress. The deep learning methods have proven its superior performances in the automated detection of plant diseases and nutrition deficiencies from visual symptoms in leaves. This article proposes a new deep learning method for plant nutrition deficiencies and disease classification using a graph convolutional network (GNN), added upon a base convolutional neural network (CNN). Sometimes, a global feature descriptor might fail to capture the vital region of a diseased leaf, which causes inaccurate classification of disease. To address this issue, regional feature learning is crucial for a holistic feature aggregation. In this work, region-based feature summarization at multi-scales is explored using spatial pyramidal pooling for discriminative feature representation. Furthermore, a GCN is developed to capacitate learning of finer details for classifying plant diseases and insufficiency of nutrients. The proposed method, called Plant Nutrition Deficiency and Disease Network (PND-Net), has been evaluated on two public datasets for nutrition deficiency, and two for disease classification using four backbone CNNs. The best classification performances of the proposed PND-Net are as follows: (a) 90.00% Banana and 90.54% Coffee nutrition deficiency; and (b) 96.18% Potato diseases and 84.30% on PlantDoc datasets using Xception backbone. Furthermore, additional experiments have been carried out for generalization, and the proposed method has achieved state-of-the-art performances on two public datasets, namely the Breast Cancer Histopathology Image Classification (BreakHis 40\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\times $$\\end{document}×: 95.50%, and BreakHis 100\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\times $$\\end{document}×: 96.79% accuracy) and Single cells in Pap smear images for cervical cancer classification (SIPaKMeD: 99.18% accuracy). Also, the proposed method has been evaluated using five-fold cross validation and achieved improved performances on these datasets. Clearly, the proposed PND-Net effectively boosts the performances of automated health analysis of various plants in real and intricate field environments, implying PND-Net’s aptness for agricultural growth as well as human cancer classification.",

        "title": "Plant leaf disease recognition based on improved SinGAN and improved ResNet34",
        "abstract": "The identification of plant leaf diseases is crucial in precision agriculture, playing a pivotal role in advancing the modernization of agriculture. Timely detection and diagnosis of leaf diseases for preventive measures significantly contribute to enhancing both the quantity and quality of agricultural products, thereby fostering the in-depth development of precision agriculture. However, despite the rapid development of research on plant leaf disease identification, it still faces challenges such as insufficient agricultural datasets and the problem of deep learning-based disease identification models having numerous training parameters and insufficient accuracy. This paper proposes a plant leaf disease identification method based on improved SinGAN and improved ResNet34 to address the aforementioned issues. Firstly, an improved SinGAN called Reconstruction-Based Single Image Generation Network (ReSinGN) is proposed for image enhancement. This network accelerates model training speed by using an autoencoder to replace the GAN in the SinGAN and incorporates a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the autoencoder to more accurately capture important features and structural information in the images. Random pixel Shuffling are introduced in ReSinGN to enable the model to learn richer data representations, further enhancing the quality of generated images. Secondly, an improved ResNet34 is proposed for plant leaf disease identification. This involves adding CBAM modules to the ResNet34 to alleviate the limitations of parameter sharing, replacing the ReLU activation function with LeakyReLU activation function to address the problem of neuron death, and utilizing transfer learning-based training methods to accelerate network training speed. This paper takes tomato leaf diseases as the experimental subject, and the experimental results demonstrate that: (1) ReSinGN generates high-quality images at least 44.6 times faster in training speed compared to SinGAN. (2) The Tenengrad score of images generated by the ReSinGN model is 67.3, which is improved by 30.2 compared to the SinGAN, resulting in clearer images. (3) ReSinGN model with random pixel Shuffling outperforms SinGAN in both image clarity and distortion, achieving the optimal balance between image clarity and distortion. (4) The improved ResNet34 achieved an average recognition accuracy, recognition precision, recognition accuracy (redundant as it’s similar to precision), recall, and F1 score of 98.57, 96.57, 98.68, 97.7, and 98.17%, respectively, for tomato leaf disease identification. Compared to the original ResNet34, this represents enhancements of 3.65, 4.66, 0.88, 4.1, and 2.47%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Diseases significantly impact plant growth, and one reliable way of detecting illnesses is to observe changes in the leaves. Plant diseases are caused by a number of pests that eat on the leaves, stems, bases, and entire plant. Therefore, it’s critical to detect and eradicate the illness before it harms plants. Identifying and treating plant diseases manually is becoming more and more challenging. Advancements in deep learning, particularly deep clustering algorithms, have significantly contributed to the discovery and diagnosis of plant diseases. For this purpose, we explore the effectiveness of a deep clustering model based on Dynamic Autoencoder to improve plant disease detection. This approach aims to tackle challenges such as feature drift and randomness, while also adapting to the evolving nature of the data and enhancing disease detection accuracy. Results from an experimental study using PlantVillage datasets were compared with current methods, demonstrating the model’s superiority and performance.",

In this paper, we propose Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE), a novel unsupervised generative clustering approach within the framework of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). Specifically, VaDE models the data generative procedure with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a deep neural network (DNN): 1) the GMM picks a cluster; 2) from which a latent embedding is generated; 3) then the DNN decodes the latent embedding into an observable. Inference in VaDE is done in a variational way: a different DNN is used to encode observables to latent embeddings, so that the evidence lower bound (ELBO) can be optimized using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) estimator and the reparameterization trick. Quantitative comparisons with strong baselines are included in this paper, and experimental results show that VaDE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art clustering methods on 5 benchmarks from various modalities. Moreover, by VaDE's generative nature, we show its capability of generating highly realistic samples for any specified cluster, without using supervised information during training.",

            "abstract": "Deep clustering learns deep feature representations that favor clustering task using neural networks. Some pioneering work proposes to simultaneously learn embedded features and perform clustering by explicitly deﬁning a clustering oriented loss. Though promising performance has been demonstrated in various applications, we observe that a vital ingredient has been overlooked by these work that the deﬁned clustering loss may corrupt feature space, which leads to non-representative mean-ingless features and this in turn hurts clustering performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Improved Deep Embedded Clustering (IDEC) algorithm to take care of data structure preservation. Speciﬁcally, we manipulate feature space to scatter data points using a clustering loss as guidance. To constrain the manipulation and maintain the local structure of data generating distribution, an under-complete autoencoder is applied. By integrating the clustering loss and autoencoder’s reconstruction loss, IDEC can jointly optimize cluster labels assignment and learn features that are suitable for clustering with local structure preservation. The resultant optimization problem can be effectively solved by mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. Experiments on image and text datasets empirically validate the importance of local structure preservation and the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

In some cases, autoencoders can \"interpolate\": By decoding the convex combination of the latent codes for two datapoints, the autoencoder can produce an output which semantically mixes characteristics from the datapoints. In this paper, we propose a regularization procedure which encourages interpolated outputs to appear more realistic by fooling a critic network which has been trained to recover the mixing coefficient from interpolated data. We then develop a simple benchmark task where we can quantitatively measure the extent to which various autoencoders can interpolate and show that our regularizer dramatically improves interpolation in this setting. We also demonstrate empirically that our regularizer produces latent codes which are more effective on downstream tasks, suggesting a possible link between interpolation abilities and learning useful representations.",

            "abstract": "Early detection of grapevine viral diseases is critical for early interventions in order to prevent the disease from spreading to the entire vineyard. Hyperspectral remote sensing can potentially detect and quantify viral diseases in a nondestructive manner. This study utilized hyperspectral imagery at the plant level to identify and classify grapevines inoculated with the newly discovered DNA virus grapevine vein-clearing virus (GVCV) at the early asymptomatic stages. An experiment was set up at a test site at South Farm Research Center, Columbia, MO, USA (38.92 N, −92.28 W), with two grapevine groups, namely healthy and GVCV-infected, while other conditions were controlled. Images of each vine were captured by a SPECIM IQ 400–1000 nm hyperspectral sensor (Oulu, Finland). Hyperspectral images were calibrated and preprocessed to retain only grapevine pixels. A statistical approach was employed to discriminate two reflectance spectra patterns between healthy and GVCV vines. Disease-centric vegetation indices (VIs) were established and explored in terms of their importance to the classification power. Pixel-wise (spectral features) classification was performed in parallel with image-wise (joint spatial–spectral features) classification within a framework involving deep learning architectures and traditional machine learning. The results showed that: (1) the discriminative wavelength regions included the 900–940 nm range in the near-infrared (NIR) region in vines 30 days after sowing (DAS) and the entire visual (VIS) region of 400–700 nm in vines 90 DAS; (2) the normalized pheophytization index (NPQI), fluorescence ratio index 1 (FRI1), plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), anthocyanin index (AntGitelson), and water stress and canopy temperature (WSCT) measures were the most discriminative indices; (3) the support vector machine (SVM) was effective in VI-wise classification with smaller feature spaces, while the RF classifier performed better in pixel-wise and image-wise classification with larger feature spaces; and (4) the automated 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) feature extractor provided promising results over the 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) in learning features from hyperspectral data cubes with a limited number of samples.",

This hybrid system is a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN), convolutional attention module (CBAM), and support vector machines (SVM). Initially, the proposed model can detect nine different tomato diseases but is not limited to this. The proposed system is tested using a database containing images of tomato leaves. The obtained results were very encouraging, giving us accuracy up to 97.2%, which can be improved with the improvement of learning processes. The proposed system is very efficient and lightweight, so the farmer can install it on any smart device having a digital camera and processing capabilities.

            "abstract": "The current methods of classifying plant disease images are mainly affected by the training phase and the characteristics of the target dataset. Collecting plant samples during different leaf life cycle infection stages is time-consuming. However, these samples may have multiple symptoms that share the same features but with different densities. The manual labelling of such samples demands exhaustive labour work that may contain errors and corrupt the training phase. Furthermore, the labelling and the annotation consider the dominant disease and neglect the minor disease, leading to misclassification. This paper proposes a fully automated leaf disease diagnosis framework that extracts the region of interest based on a modified colour process, according to which syndrome is self-clustered using an extended Gaussian kernel density estimation and the probability of the nearest shared neighbourhood. Each group of symptoms is presented to the classifier independently. The objective is to cluster symptoms using a nonparametric method, decrease the classification error, and reduce the need for a large-scale dataset to train the classifier. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed framework, coffee leaf datasets were selected to assess the framework performance due to a wide variety of feature demonstrations at different levels of infections. Several kernels with their appropriate bandwidth selector were compared. The best probabilities were achieved by the proposed extended Gaussian kernel, which connects the neighbouring lesions in one symptom cluster, where there is no need for any influencing set that guides toward the correct cluster. Clusters are presented with an equal priority to a ResNet50 classifier, so misclassification is reduced with an accuracy of up to 98%.",

Specifically, it possesses the ability to utilize two or more levels of non-linear feature transformation of the given data via representation learning in order to overcome limitations posed by large datasets. As a multidisciplinary field that is still in its nascent phase, articles that survey DL architectures encompassing the full scope of the field are rather limited. Thus, this paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-art DL modelling techniques and provides insights into their advantages and challenges. It was found that many of the models exhibit a highly domain-specific efficiency and could be trained by two or more methods. However, training DL models can be very time-consuming, expensive, and requires huge samples for better accuracy. Since DL is also susceptible to deception and misclassification and tends to get stuck on local minima, improved optimization of parameters is required to create more robust models. Regardless, DL has already been leading to groundbreaking results in the healthcare, education, security, commercial, industrial, as well as government sectors. Some models, like the convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), recurrent neural network (RNN), recursive neural networks, and autoencoders, are frequently used, while the potential of other models remains widely unexplored. Pertinently, hybrid conventional DL architectures have the capacity to overcome the challenges experienced by conventional models. Considering that capsule architectures may dominate future DL models, this work aimed to compile information for stakeholders involved in the development and use of DL models in the contemporary world.",

The farmers are encountering various challenges in diagnosing diseases in cotton crops for the last decade. The attack of disease ultimately lessens the cotton yield and as a result, the economy of the country and the income of the farmers also go down. The detection of disease in crops at an early stage is crucial which can ultimately save farmers from loss. Manual detection is difficult and time-consuming an automated system to detect disease in plants with high accuracy will be handy for farmers. A deep learning approach is used in the proposed work to detect the disease in the crop plant. The Deep Convolutional Neural Networks model has been utilized to detect cotton plant disease using the image dataset of the cotton plant leaves. The model achieved a training accuracy of 99.08% validation accuracy of 100%. The proposed methodology will allow farmers to correctly detect diseases in the early stage. The diagnosis of plant disease helps to cure it in time. If the disease is controlled in time, its ultimate effect will be on the yield of the cotton crop. This will improve farmer income and the GDP of a country.",

            "abstract": "Food production is a growing challenge with the increasing global population. To increase the yield of food production, we need to adopt new biotechnology-based fertilization techniques. Furthermore, we need to improve early prevention steps against plant disease. Guava is an essential fruit in Asian countries such as Pakistan, which is fourth in its production. Several pathological and fungal diseases attack guava plants. Furthermore, postharvest infections might result in significant output losses. A professional opinion is essential for disease analysis due to minor variances in various guava disease symptoms. Farmers’ poor usage of pesticides may result in financial losses due to incorrect diagnosis. Computer-vision-based monitoring is required with developing field guava plants. This research uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based data enhancement using color-histogram equalization and the unsharp masking technique to identify different guava plant species. Nine angles from 360∘ were applied to increase the number of transformed plant images. These augmented data were then fed as input into state-of-the-art classification networks. The proposed method was first normalized and preprocessed. A locally collected guava disease dataset from Pakistan was used for the experimental evaluation. The proposed study uses five neural network structures, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101, to identify different guava plant species. The experimental results proved that ResNet-101 obtained the highest classification results, with 97.74% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Plant leaf disease detection is the process of discovering and diagnosing diseases that damage the plant leaves. This can be done using a variety of approaches including visual inspection, laboratory tests, computer vision techniques etc. Plant leaf diseases must be detected and categorize the cause in order to take corresponding counter measures to manage and control them for healthy and achieve high-yielding crops. In this contemporary Deep Learning era traditional object detection methods have become obsolete due to limitations such as the need for manual crafted features, lack of robustness, and inability to handle large datasets. Deep learning-based approaches are more robust, can account for differences in brightness, interference, and perspective, and can automatically learn features from enormous datasets. These techniques are practical because they can efficiently process large datasets in a brief time frame. Several research studies have developed expert and automatic disease detection methods. Most of this research are limited to one or two plant species and a few disease types. In this research study, we presented a computer vision approach applying the state-of-the-art YOLO algorithm with our own dataset consisting of 8 different classes of pant leaf diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses and pest. Our system achieved promising results and effectively predicted the diseases with the bounding boxes and class probabilities. Overall, this research paper provides a solution for plant disease detection using YOLOv5 and contributes to the development of automated agricultural management systems.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification and various other computer vision tasks. Plant disease detection is an important area of deep learning which has been addressed by many recent methods. However, there is a dire need to optimize these solutions for resource-constrained portable devices such as smartphones. This is a challenging problem because deep learning models are resource extensive in nature. This paper proposes an efficient method to systematically classify plant disease symptoms using convolutional neural networks. These networks are memory efficient and when coupled with the proposed training configuration it enables rapid development of industrial applications by reducing the training times. Another critical problem arises with the improper distribution of samples among classes known as the class imbalance problem, which is addressed by employing a simple statistical methodology. Transfer learning is a known technique for training small datasets which transfers pre-trained weights learned on a large dataset. However, during transfer learning, negative transfer learning is a common problem. Therefore, a stepwise transfer learning approach is proposed which can help in fast convergence, while reducing overfitting and preventing negative transfer learning during knowledge transfer across domains. The system is trained and evaluated on two plant disease datasets i.e., PlantVillage (a publicly available dataset) and pepper disease dataset provided by the National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science, Republic of Korea. The pepper dataset is particularly challenging as it contains images from different parts of the plant such as the leaf, pulp, and stem. The proposed system has dominated the previous works on the PlantVillage dataset and achieved 99% and 99.69% accuracy on the Pepper dataset and PlantVillage datasets, respectively.",

Within this context, we propose a deep learning-based feature extraction method for the identification of plant species and the classification of plant leaf diseases. We focus on results relevant to real-time processing scenarios that can be easily transferred to manned/unmanned agricultural smart machinery (e.g. tractors, drones, robots, IoT smart sensor networks, etc.) by reconsidering the common processing pipeline. In our approach, texture features are extracted from different layers of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network models and are later applied to a machine-learning classifier. For the experimental evaluation, we used publicly available datasets consisting of RGB textured images and datasets containing images of healthy and non-healthy plant leaves of different species. We compared our method to feature vectors derived from traditional handcrafted feature extraction descriptors computed for the same images and end-to-end deep-learning approaches. The proposed method proves to be significantly more efficient in terms of processing times and discriminative power, being able to surpass traditional and end-to-end CNN-based methods and provide a solution also to the problem of the reduced datasets available for precision agriculture.",

Beans is also one of the most important plants and seeds which are used worldwide for cooking in either dried or fresh form. Beans are a great source of protein that offer many health benefits, but there are a lot of diseases associated with beans leaf which hinder its production such as angular leaf spot disease and bean rust disease. Thus, an accurate classification of bean leaf diseases is needed to solve the problem in the early stage. A deep learning approach is proposed to identify and classify beans leaf disease by using public dataset of leaf image and MobileNet model with the open source library TensorFlow. In this study, we proposed a method to classify beans leaf disease and to find and describe the efficient network architecture (hyperparameters and optimization methods ). Moreover, after applying each architecture separately, we compared their obtained results to find out the best architecture configuration for classifying bean leaf diseases and their results. On the other hand, to satisfy the classification requirements, the model was trained using MobileNetV2 architecture under the some controlled conditions as MobileNet to check if we could get faster training times, higher accuracy and easier retraining, we evaluated and implemented MobileNet architectures on one public dataset including two unhealthy classes (angular leaf spot disease and bean rust disease) and one healthy class, the algorithm was tested on 1296 images of bean leaf, the obtained results showed that our MobileNet model achieves highest classification performance for beans leaf disease, the classification average accuracy of the proposed model is more than 97% on training dataset and more than 92% on test data for two unhealthy classes and one healthy class.",

Moreover, the complex network occupies a large amount of computer memory and wastes a large amount of computing resources, which is difficult to meet the needs of low-cost terminals. This paper proposes a fine-grained disease categorization method based on attention network to solve the problem. In “Classification Model”, attention mechanism is used to increase identification ability. “Reconstruction-Generation Model” were added during training and the “Classification Model” have to pay more attention to differentiate areas to find differences instead of paying more attention to global features. And adversarial loss was applied to distinguish the generated image from the original image to suppress the noise introduced by the “Discrimination Model”. Due to the feature that “Reconstruction-Generation Model” and “Discrimination Model” are only used in training and do not participate in the operation of inference phase, which can not increase the complexity of the model. Compared with the traditional classification network, the method of generalization ability enhancement further enhances the identification accuracy. And the method needs less memory but can achieve low performance terminal real-time identification of peach and tomato leaf diseases. And it can be applied in other crop disease identification fields with the similar application scenarios.",

Usually, farmers or experts observe the plants with eye for detection and identification of disease. But this method is often time processing, expensive and inaccurate. Automatic detection using image processing techniques provide fast and accurate results. This paper cares with a replacement approach to the development of disease recognition model, supported leaf image classification, by the utilization of deep convolutional networks. Advances in computer vision present a chance to expand and enhance the practice of precise plant protection and extend the market of computer vision applications within the field of precision agriculture. a completely unique way of training and therefore the methodology used facilitate a fast and straightforward system implementation in practice. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images to make a database, assessed by agricultural experts, a deep learning framework to perform the deep CNN training. This method paper may be a new approach in detecting plant diseases using the deep convolutional neural network trained and finetuned to suit accurately to the database of a plants leaves that was gathered independently for diverse plant diseases. The advance and novelty of the developed model dwell its simplicity healthy leaves and background images are in line with other classes, enabling the model to distinguish between diseased leaves and healthy ones or from the environment by using CNN. Plants are the source of food on earth. Infections and diseases in plants are therefore a big threat, while the foremost common diagnosis is primarily performed by examining the plant body for the presence of visual symptoms [1]. As an alternative to the traditionally time-consuming process, different research works plan to find feasible approaches towards protecting plants. In recent years, growth in technology has engendered several alternatives to traditional arduous methods [2]. Deep learning techniques are very successful in image classification problems.",

We conduct the present work using a deep learning approach based on the AlexNet model to classify diseased and healthy millet crop leaves. We use a publicly available dataset with pictures of the two types of leaves and add to AlexNet by using its convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to pull out features and tell leaf pictures apart based on how they look. Our approach consists of training the model after applying preprocessing steps to the images and testing it to detect whether the leaves are healthy or diseased. The results demonstrate that we can apply this deep learning-centered approach to tackle the issue of plant leaf disease detection on a large scale, enabling farmers to implement the necessary control measures promptly.",

In this work, we explore how we can improve the privacy-utility tradeoff of DP-SGD by learning priors from images generated by random processes and transferring these priors to private data.

The bacterial spot, late blight, septoria leaf spot and yellow curved leaf diseases affect the crop quality of tomatoes. Automatic methods for classification of plant diseases also help taking action after detecting the symptoms of leaf diseases. This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm based method for tomato leaf disease detection and classification. The dataset contains 500 images of tomato leaves with four symptoms of diseases. We have modeled a CNN for automatic feature extraction and classification. Color information is actively used for plant leaf disease researches. In our model, the filters are applied to three channels based on RGB components. The LVQ has been fed with the output feature vector of convolution part for training the network. The experimental results validate that the proposed method effectively recognizes four different types of tomato leaf diseases.",

        "title": "A Deep Learning Approach for Crop Disease and Pest Classification Using Swin Transformer and Dual-Attention Multi-Scale Fusion Network",
        "abstract": "Crops are essential for the survival of the human race, and their significance steadily rises alongside the increasing global population. Cashew, cassava, maize, and tomato are major economic crops that support the livelihoods, economies, and cultures of many countries. However, these crops face several threats from diseases and pests, which can lead to significant yield and economic losses. Early identification of crop diseases is essential for protecting crops and ensuring global food supply. Current diagnostic methods are mostly manual, which is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. Visual inspection by farmers for disease and pest symptoms often leads to delayed identification, leading to the progression of diseases to more severe stages. Deep learning offers a fast and accurate solution to this problem by automating the process of disease and pest detection. This research proposes a new feature fusion-based model that uses two parallel tracks to extract features from plant images. The Swin transformer track captures global features through shifted windows and self-attention. The Dual-Attention Multi-scale Fusion Network (DAMFN) track extracts local features using two specialised blocks: Multi-Separable Attention (MSA) and Tri Shuffle Convolution Attention (TSCA) blocks. These blocks have varied kernel sizes and attention modules to capture refined features at multiple scales. To our current understanding, this study is the first to present the results derived from a dual-track architecture employed for the detection of crop diseases and pests, utilizing a combination of the Swin transformer and DAMFN networks. The model then combines the features extracted by both tracks and uses triplet attention to focus on the most informative regions for precise classification. The performance of the proposed network surpassed several state-of-the-art architectures and achieved an accuracy of 95.68% on the CCMT dataset.",

We used U.S. cooperative FHB wheat nursery data to evaluate GS models for several FHB resistance traits including deoxynivalenol (DON) levels. For all traits we compared the models: ridge regression (RR), Bayesian LASSO (BL), reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) regression, random forest (RF) regression, and multiple linear regression (MLR) (fixed effects). For DON, we evaluated additional prediction methods including bivariate RR models, phenotypes for correlated traits, and RF regression models combining markers and correlated phenotypes as predictors. Additionally, for all traits, we compared different marker sets including genomewide markers, FHB quantitative trait loci (QTL) targeted markers, and both sets combined. Genomic selection accuracies were always higher than MLR accuracies, RF and RKHS regression were often the most accurate methods, and for DON, marker plus trait RF regression was more accurate than all other methods. For all traits except DON, using QTL targeted markers alone led to lower accuracies than using genomewide markers. This study indicates that cooperative FHB nursery data can be useful for GS, and prior information about correlated traits and QTL could be used to improve accuracies in some cases.",

            "abstract": "Crop pests are to blame for significant economic, social, and environmental losses worldwide. Various pests have different control strategies, and precisely identifying pests has become crucial to pest control and is a significant difficulty in agriculture. Many agricultural professionals are interested in deep learning (DL) models since they have shown significant promise in image recognition. Pest identification approaches in literature have relatively low accuracy in pest recognition and classification due to the complexity of their algorithms and limited data availability. Misclassification of insect pests sometimes leads to using the wrong pesticides, causing harm to agricultural yields and the surrounding environment. It necessitates developing an automated system capable of more accurate pest identification and classification. This paper presents a novel end-to-end DeepPestNet framework for pest recognition and classification. The proposed model has 11 learnable layers, including eight convolutional and three fully connected (FC) layers. We used image rotations techniques to increase the size of the dataset and image augmentations techniques to test the generalizability of the proposed DeepPestNet approach. We used the popular Deng’s crops data set to assess the proposed DeepPestNet framework. We used the proposed method to recognize and classify crop pests into 10-class pests, i.e., Locusta migratoria, Euproctis pseudoconspersa strand, chrysochus Chinensis, empoasca flavescens, Spodoptera exigua, larva of laspeyresia pomonella, parasa lepida, acrida cinerea, larva of S. exigua, and L.pomonella types of insects pests. The proposed method achieved optimal accuracy of 100%. We compared the proposed DeepPestNet approach with traditional pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. To verify the general adaptability of this model, we tested the proposed model on the standard Kaggle dataset “Pest Dataset” to recognize nine types of pests: aphids, armyworm, beetle, bollworm, grasshopper, mites, mosquito, sawfly, and stem borer and achieved an accuracy of 98.92%. The proposed model can provide specialists and farmers with immediate and effective aid in recognizing pests, potentially reducing economic and crop yield losses.",

The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage. We explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve trade-offs between performance and speed. Moreover, we extend our network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.",

However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN – network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge (region 3) with the best perceptual index.

However, farmers’ dependence on conventional manual techniques presents a difficulty in accurately pinpointing particular diseases. This research investigates the utilization of the YOLOv4 algorithm for detecting and identifying plant leaf diseases. This study uses the comprehensive Plant Village Dataset, which includes over fifty thousand photos of healthy and diseased plant leaves from fourteen different species, to develop advanced disease prediction systems in agriculture. Data augmentation techniques including histogram equalization and horizontal flip were used to improve the dataset and strengthen the model’s resilience. A comprehensive assessment of the YOLOv4 algorithm was conducted, which involved comparing its performance with established target identification methods including Densenet, Alexanet, and neural networks. When YOLOv4 was used on the Plant Village dataset, it achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.99%. The evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, consistently showed high performance with a value of 0.99, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. This study’s results demonstrate substantial advancements in plant disease detection and underscore the capabilities of YOLOv4 as a sophisticated tool for accurate disease prediction. These developments have significant significance for everyone involved in agriculture, researchers, and farmers, providing improved capacities for disease control and crop protection.",

This has given rise to what is now known as Agriculture 4.0, which emphasizes strategy and systems rather than the traditional obligations of the past. As a result, many human procedures have been replaced by a new generation of intelligent devices. Crop production management in Agriculture 4.0, on the other hand, poses a considerable challenge, particularly when it comes to prompt and accurate crop disease identification. Plant diseases are of special significance since they significantly reduce agricultural yield in terms of both quality and quantity. Deep learning neural network models are being utilized for early diagnosis of plant diseases in order to overcome this difficulty. These models can automatically extract features, generate high-dimensional features from low-dimensional ones, and achieve better learning results. In this research, we offer a joint solution involving image processing, phy-topathology, and embedded platforms that intends to minimize the time necessary for human labor by leveraging AI to facilitate plant disease detection. We propose a learning-based PlantNet architecture for detecting plant diseases from leaf images, in which achieved about 97 % accuracy and about 0.27 loss on the PlantVillage dataset.

            "abstract": "Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.",

Early diagnosis and accurate identification of apple leaf diseases can control the spread of infection and ensure the healthy development of the apple industry. The existing research uses complex image preprocessing and cannot guarantee high recognition rates for apple leaf diseases. This paper proposes an accurate identifying approach for apple leaf diseases based on deep convolutional neural networks. It includes generating sufficient pathological images and designing a novel architecture of a deep convolutional neural network based on AlexNet to detect apple leaf diseases. Using a dataset of 13,689 images of diseased apple leaves, the proposed deep convolutional neural network model is trained to identify the four common apple leaf diseases. Under the hold-out test set, the experimental results show that the proposed disease identification approach based on the convolutional neural network achieves an overall accuracy of 97.62%, the model parameters are reduced by 51,206,928 compared with those in the standard AlexNet model, and the accuracy of the proposed model with generated pathological images obtains an improvement of 10.83%. This research indicates that the proposed deep learning model provides a better solution in disease control for apple leaf diseases with high accuracy and a faster convergence rate, and that the image generation technique proposed in this paper can enhance the robustness of the convolutional neural network model.",

This work presents an FPGA-based 20 kfps streaming camera system, which can classify regions of interest (ROI) within a frame with a binarized neural network (BNN) in realtime streaming mode, achieving massive data reduction. BNNs have the potential to enable energy-efficient image classifications for on-device processing. We demonstrate our system in a case study with a simple real-time BNN classifier achieving 19.28 us latency at 0.52 W power consumption and resulting in a 980x data reduction. We compare external image processing with this result, showing 3x energy savings, and discuss the used HDL/HLS design flow for BNN implementation.",

            "abstract": "Due to recent advances in digital technologies, and availability of credible data, an area of artificial intelligence, deep learning, has emerged and has demonstrated its ability and effectiveness in solving complex learning problems not possible before. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in the image detection and recognition applications. However, they require intensive CPU operations and memory bandwidth that make general CPUs fail to achieve the desired performance levels. Consequently, hardware accelerators that use application-specific integrated circuits, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and graphic processing units have been employed to improve the throughput of CNNs. More precisely, FPGAs have been recently adopted for accelerating the implementation of deep learning networks due to their ability to maximize parallelism and their energy efficiency. In this paper, we review the recent existing techniques for accelerating deep learning networks on FPGAs. We highlight the key features employed by the various techniques for improving the acceleration performance. In addition, we provide recommendations for enhancing the utilization of FPGAs for CNNs acceleration. The techniques investigated in this paper represent the recent trends in the FPGA-based accelerators of deep learning networks. Thus, this paper is expected to direct the future advances on efficient hardware accelerators and to be useful for deep learning researchers.",

            "abstract": "The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used in many fields and has achieved remarkable results, such as image classification, face detection, and speech recognition. Compared to GPU (graphics processing unit) and ASIC, a FPGA (field programmable gate array)-based CNN accelerator has great advantages due to its low power consumption and reconfigurable property. However, FPGA’s extremely limited resources and CNN’s huge amount of parameters and computational complexity pose great challenges to the design. Based on the ZYNQ heterogeneous platform and the coordination of resource and bandwidth issues with the roofline model, the CNN accelerator we designed can accelerate both standard convolution and depthwise separable convolution with a high hardware resource rate. The accelerator can handle network layers of different scales through parameter configuration and maximizes bandwidth and achieves full pipelined by using a data stream interface and ping-pong on-chip cache. The experimental results show that the accelerator designed in this paper can achieve 17.11GOPS for 32bit floating point when it can also accelerate depthwise separable convolution, which has obvious advantages compared with other designs.",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) have gained popularity in many complicated computer vision applications. Many customized accelerators based on FPGAs are proposed for 2D CNNs, while very few are for 3D CNNs. Three-D CNNs are far more computationally intensive and the design space for 3D CNN acceleration has been further expanded since one more dimension is introduced, making it a big challenge to accelerate 3D CNNs on FPGAs. Motivated by the finding that the computation patterns of 2D and 3D CNNs are very similar, we propose a uniform architecture design for accelerating both 2D and 3D CNNs in this paper. The uniform architecture is based on the idea of mapping convolutions to matrix multiplications. A customized mapping module is developed to generate the feature matrix tilings with no need to store the entire enlarged feature matrix on-chip or off-chip, a splitting strategy is adopted to reconstruct a convolutional layer to adapt to the on-chip memory capacity, and a 2D multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) array is adopted to compute matrix multiplications efficiently. For demonstration, we implement an accelerator prototype with a high-level synthesis (HLS) methodology on a Xilinx VC709 board and test the accelerator on three typical CNN models: AlexNet, VGG16, and C3D. Experimental results show that the accelerator achieves state-of-the-art throughput performance on both 2D and 3D CNNs, with much better energy efficiency than the CPU and GPU.",

We pre-trained our model on Resnet152 and Inceptionv3 Convolution Neural Network architectures. The Resnet152 achieved an accuracy of 99.2% and Inceptionv3 an accuracy of 95.41%. On deployment using Android mobile phones, we chose Inceptionv3 since it has lower memory requirements compared to Resnet152. The mobile application on real environment detected the two diseases with a confidence level of 99% of the captured leaf area. This result indicates the potential in improving the yield of bananas by smallholder farmers using a tool for early detection of diseases.",

It is currently playing a vital role in the early detection and classification of plant diseases. The use of ML techniques in this field is viewed as having brought considerable improvement in cultivation productivity sectors, particularly with the recent emergence of DL, which seems to have increased accuracy levels. Recently, many DL architectures have been implemented accompanying visualisation techniques that are essential for determining symptoms and classifying plant diseases. This review investigates and analyses the most recent methods, developed over three years leading up to 2020, for training, augmentation, feature fusion and extraction, recognising and counting crops, and detecting plant diseases, including how these methods can be harnessed to feed deep classifiers and their effects on classifier accuracy.",

However, pests and diseases are a threat to food security. Early detection of banana diseases is important to identify the diseases before too much damage is done on the plants. In this paper, a tool for early detection of banana diseases by using a deep learning approach is proposed. Five deep learning architectures, namely Vgg16, Resnet18, Resnet50, Resnet152 and InceptionV3 were used to develop models for banana disease detection, achieving all high accuracies, varying from 95.41% for InceptionV3 to 99.2% for Resnet152. InceptionV3 was selected for mobile deployment because it demands much less memory. The developed tool was capable of detecting diseases with a confidence of 99% of the captured leaves from the real environment. This tool will help smallholder farmers conduct early detection of banana diseases and improve their productivity.",

To evaluate the value of the systems, this study examines, as a case study, USDA’s coordinated framework for soybean rust surveillance, reporting, prediction, and management, which was developed before the 2005 growing season. The framework’s linchpin is a website that provides real-time, county-level information on the spread of the disease. The study assesses the value of the information tool to farmers and factors that influence that value. The information’s value depends most heavily on farmers’ perceptions of the forecast’s accuracy. The study finds that the framework’s information is valuable to farmers even in a year with a low rust infection like that of 2005. We estimate that the information provided by the framework increased U.S. soybean producers’ profits by a total of $11-$299 million in 2005, or between 16 cents and $4.12 per acre, depending on the quality of information and other factors. The reported cost of the framework was between $2.6 million and almost $5 million in 2005.",

        "title": "Advancing common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) disease detection with YOLO driven deep learning to enhance agricultural AI",
        "abstract": "Common beans (CB), a vital source for high protein content, plays a crucial role in ensuring both nutrition and economic stability in diverse communities, particularly in Africa and Latin America. However, CB cultivation poses a significant threat to diseases that can drastically reduce yield and quality. Detecting these diseases solely based on visual symptoms is challenging, due to the variability across different pathogens and similar symptoms caused by distinct pathogens, further complicating the detection process. Traditional methods relying solely on farmers’ ability to detect diseases is inadequate, and while engaging expert pathologists and advanced laboratories is necessary, it can also be resource intensive. To address this challenge, we present a AI-driven system for rapid and cost-effective CB disease detection, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning and object detection technologies. We utilized an extensive image dataset collected from disease hotspots in Africa and Colombia, focusing on five major diseases: Angular Leaf Spot (ALS), Common Bacterial Blight (CBB), Common Bean Mosaic Virus (CBMV), Bean Rust, and Anthracnose, covering both leaf and pod samples in real-field settings. However, pod images are only available for Angular Leaf Spot disease. The study employed data augmentation techniques and annotation at both whole and micro levels for comprehensive analysis. To train the model, we utilized three advanced YOLO architectures: YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and YOLO-NAS. Particularly for whole leaf annotations, the YOLO-NAS model achieves the highest mAP value of up to 97.9% and a recall of 98.8%, indicating superior detection accuracy. In contrast, for whole pod disease detection, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 outperformed YOLO-NAS, with mAP values exceeding 95% and 93% recall. However, micro annotation consistently yields lower performance than whole annotation across all disease classes and plant parts, as examined by all YOLO models, highlighting an unexpected discrepancy in detection accuracy. Furthermore, we successfully deployed YOLO-NAS annotation models into an Android app, validating their effectiveness on unseen data from disease hotspots with high classification accuracy (90%). This accomplishment showcases the integration of deep learning into our production pipeline, a process known as DLOps. This innovative approach significantly reduces diagnosis time, enabling farmers to take prompt management interventions. The potential benefits extend beyond rapid diagnosis serving as an early warning system to enhance common bean productivity and quality.",

The Foggia dataset is used for this, and performance metrics such as Recall, Precision, F1-score, and mean Average Precision are employed. Our methodology trains each architecture for 300 epochs, focusing on recall for its relevance in this area. The ‘best models’ are evaluated on the Foggia test set and further tested with a challenging, custom-assembled dataset from independent online sources to assess real-world performance. Results show that YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 exhibit a balanced performance across all metrics in both validation and testing. YOLOv6 performs slightly lower in recall during validation but achieves a good balance on testing. YOLO-NAS variants excel in recall, making them suitable for minimizing missed detections. However, precision performance is lower for YOLO-NAS models. Visual results demonstrate that top-performing models accurately identify most instances in the test set. However, they struggle with distant scenes and poor lighting conditions, occasionally detecting false positives. In favorable conditions, the models perform well in identifying relevant instances. We conclude that no single model excels in all aspects of smoke and wildfire detection. The choice of model depends on specific application requirements, considering accuracy, recall, and inference time. This research enriches the field of computer vision for smoke and wildfire detection, laying a foundation for system enhancements and serving as a basis for future research to optimize detection effectiveness.",

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",

            "abstract": "In the field of computer, mobile and embedded vision Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning models which play a significant role in object detection and recognition. MobileNet is one such efficient, light-weighted model for this purpose, but there are many constraints or challenges for the hardware deployment of such architectures into resource-constrained micro-controller units due to limited memory, energy and power. Also, the overall accuracy of the model generally decreases when the size and the total number of parameters are reduced by any method such as pruning or deep compression. The paper proposes three hybrid MobileNet architectures which has improved accuracy along-with reduced size, lesser number of layers, lower average computation time and very less overfitting as compared to the baseline MobileNet v1. The reason behind developing these models is to have a variant of the existing MobileNet model which will be easily deployable in memory constrained MCUs. We name the model having the smallest size (9.9 MB) as Thin MobileNet. We achieve an increase in accuracy by replacing the standard non-linear activation function ReLU with Drop Activation and introducing Random erasing regularization technique in place of drop out. The model size is reduced by using Separable Convolutions instead of the Depthwise separable convolutions used in the baseline MobileNet. Later on, we make our model shallow by eliminating a few unnecessary layers without a drop in the accuracy. The experimental results are based on training the model on CIFAR-10 dataset.",

The majority of prior research focused on illness categorization based on images. In conventional agricultural procedures, the diagnosis of illnesses affecting rice plants is performed by professionals in a manner that is very subjective, while laboratory testing takes a significant amount of time. As a direct result of this, there is a decrease in agricultural productivity, which results in economic loss for farmers. In order to find a solution to this problem, there is a pressing need to create methods that are quick and accurate in identifying and categorizing illnesses that affect rice plants. In the field of agriculture, the development of image-based automated systems for the categorization of rice plant diseases has become an intriguing and expanding study subject. When it comes to classifying rice plant diseases, color is one of the most crucial factors. Within the scope of this investigation, an image-based method is provided for classifying rice plant diseases based on color characteristics. Deep convolutional neural systems consume recently realized astonishing results in a number of applications, one of which is the classification of tomato plants that have been affected with many illnesses. Deep convolutional neural networks with a variety of residual networks underpin our work. In conclusion, this research study has conducted disease classification based on tomato leaves by employing a pre-trained deep CNN in conjunction with the residual network. The result that ResNet-50 produced demonstrates a remarkable result with an accuracy of 96.35%",

        "abstract": "Modern detecting innovations, with a specific spotlight on manageability related issues, are impacting the fate of farming as the globe turns out to be more interconnected. The majority of emerging countries' economies is based on agriculture. The agricultural industry is one of the most vital industries, and crops are a necessity for providing food to people all over the world. The agricultural sector depends heavily on early disease detection and recognition. Crop fields are susceptible to the outbreak of plant diseases, either as a result of spreading viruses and fungus or unfavorable weather conditions, due to the lack of trained labor and enough supporting infrastructure. Owners of community gardens that want to use affordable strategies for sustainable agriculture through a sustainable. This model's suggestion offers a practical means of identifying various ailments in a range of plant species. Using the recently created dataset, an improved variant of the best deep learning (DL) model, has been suggested. In this unique circumstance, think about the possible utilization of the Social Internet of Things for detecting and interchanges, deep learning for the identification of plant sicknesses, and crowd sourcing for the collection and grouping of pictures, drawing in ranchers and local area garden proprietors and specialists. Across data fusion and deep learning, the created structure can take utility of the information gathered and estimate with a certain level of accuracy when a plant would (or would not) contract a disease. The user application must be able to interface with the virtualization layer and must be able to assess the health of the plants using images, data from garden sensors, and Internet access. Take some photos of the plant to assess its health and to provide feedback on any photos of the plant that haven't yet been tagged for the classifier data set. In addition to the user's smart phone's photo, the diagnosis of a crop disease necessitates collecting all the information from the sensors owned by other users and keeping track of various environmental conditions in the garden. It consists of three steps: tuning the sampling frequency, sending a request for cultivation-related sensors, and aggregating the sensor data. Additionally, it aids in forecasting plant diseases based on previously observed environmental variables. Additionally, the model demonstrates here the effectiveness and accuracy of the deep learning model used for plant identification, as well as the benefits of utilizing Social IoT engineering. The majority of the suggested DL frameworks in the literature have decent detection performance on their own datasets, but the performance is subpar on other datasets. In reality, once data are provided for a specific plant illness, the pattern for anticipating a upcoming infection of the plant is prepared.",

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid intelligent algorithm (GAACO) including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACO) and Tabu list for different types of images segmentation as well as plant leaf or fruit image segmentation and transductive support vector machine (TSVM) is used to detect diseases of plant leaf or fruit. In this process, Genetic Algorithm is used to search for most optimal cluster centers in the problem space and then the Ant Colony Optimization is employed to achieve the best solution. Tabu list is used to save the image pixels into the memory. After image segmentation, the transductive support vector machine is used in testing phase and the obtained testing samples are compared with training samples. However, plant leaf disease or fruit disease detection is done by TSVM in accordance with leaf or fruit feature extraction. The result of the proposed algorithm shows that the hybrid GAACO algorithm gives high performance with a very low computational complexity, helps to enhance segmentation accuracy and supports TSVM to find the accurate diseases.",

        "abstract": "Since ancient times, agricultural diseases brought on by pests, bacteria, viruses, and fungus have caused significant food loss that requires worldwide attention. Therefore, crop disease diagnosis as early as possible can significantly prevent loss of yield as well increase monetary value. The disease in crop may be identified by carefully analysing either a leaf, node, or stem. Here, accurate disease diagnosis will typically depend on the resolution of the image. Iterative Super-Resolution Network (ISNR) model is used for analysing low resolution potato leaf and identifying the disease. Through a stochastic iterative denoising procedure, ISNR accomplishes super-resolution while adjusting denoising diffusion probability models by image to image translation. The presented ISNR model is evaluated using the publicly accessible PlantVillage dataset with super resolution factors 2, 4, and 6. For super resolution factors 2, 4, and 6, our model gets PSNR 33.781 dB, 35.292 dB, 37.538 dB, SSIM 0.817, 0.892, 0.953, and classification accuracies of 99.61, 98.05, and 96.09 respectively.",

            "abstract": "Super resolution is the problem of artificially enlarging a low resolution photograph to recover a plausible high resolution version. In the regime of high magnification factors, the problem is dramatically underspecified and many plausible, high resolution images may match a given low resolution image. In particular, traditional super resolution techniques fail in this regime due to the multimodality of the problem and strong prior information that must be imposed on image synthesis to produce plausible high resolution images. In this work we propose a new probabilistic deep network architecture, a pixel recursive super resolution model, that is an extension of PixelCNNs to address this problem. We demonstrate that this model produces a diversity of plausible high resolution images at large magnification factors. Furthermore, in human evaluation studies we demonstrate how previous methods fail to fool human observers. However, high resolution images sampled from this probabilistic deep network do fool a naive human observer a significant fraction of the time.",

Mango tree, specifically the fruits and the leaves are highly affected by the fungal disease named as Anthracnose. The main aim of this paper is to develop an appropriate and effective method for diagnosis of the disease and its symptoms, therefore espousing a suitable system for an early and cost-effective solution of this problem. Over the last few years, due to their higher performance capability in terms of computation and accuracy, computer vision, and deep learning methodologies have gained popularity in assorted fungal diseases classification. Therefore, for this paper, a multilayer convolutional neural network (MCNN) is proposed for the classification of the Mango leaves infected by the Anthracnose fungal disease. This paper is validated on a real-time dataset captured at the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, J&K, India consists of 1070 images of the Mango tree leaves. The dataset contains both healthy and infected leaf images. The results envisage the higher classification accuracy of the proposed MCNN model when compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches.",

The model is built on prior work on score matching and diffusion probabilistic models. It starts from a Gaussian white noise signal and iteratively refines the signal via a gradient-based sampler conditioned on the mel-spectrogram. WaveGrad offers a natural way to trade inference speed for sample quality by adjusting the number of refinement steps, and bridges the gap between non-autoregressive and autoregressive models in terms of audio quality. We find that it can generate high fidelity audio samples using as few as six iterations. Experiments reveal WaveGrad to generate high fidelity audio, outperforming adversarial non-autoregressive baselines and matching a strong likelihood-based autoregressive baseline using fewer sequential operations. Audio samples are available at this https URL.",

Image processing may boost agricultural yield. Several methods utilize images of damaged leaves or crops to diagnose plant diseases and soil quality. Research has improved sickness categorization and diagnosis in several ways. Recent statements, actions, and debates need more. Global farming uses technology. CNN and ANN are artificial neural networks. Deep or traditional Machine Learning (ML) relies on the issue, data, and computing power. When processing and data resources are available, deep learning (DL), which uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), is used for several challenging visual identification and classification tasks. It excels on its own datasets but struggles on others. This study's data, assessment criteria, and conclusions will help plant leaf and crop detection and soil quality measuring researchers.",

To overcome this problem, we did two folds of contributions. First, an infield rice disease image dataset was created. Second, a number of deep learning models including ResNets and DenseNets were applied to classify such rice diseases. The experimental results reveal that the proposed framework can achieve high accuracy, more than 95% in average, and has potential to be implemented and provide to Thai farmers in the future.",

If sufficient care is not taken in this regard, then it can have major impacts on plants by affecting the quality, quantity, or productivity of the respective product or service. In addition to reducing the amount of labor required to monitor huge farms of crops, automatic disease detection detects symptoms at an early stage, i.e., when they first develop on plant leaves. A method for picture segmentation is presented in this study, which is utilized for the automatic categorization of banana leaf diseases. The images are used to detect and classify diseases in banana plants. This is a cost-effective and efficient way for farmers to monitor the plant’s health. The images must be segmented in order to evaluate and extract information from them. This module of image processing isolates the object of interest from the rest of the image, allowing for more detailed analysis. As a result, the success of a higher-level image processing modules is determined by the precision with image segmentation modules being carried out. For segmentation and classification, a hybrid fuzzy C-means procedure is used. Additionally, in order to identify banana plant illnesses, the color, shape, and texture characteristics were extracted. To compare the suggested method with the existing deep learning methods, for diseases such as black sigatoka, yellow sigatoka, dried/old leaves, banana bacterial wilt with healthy plants, several quantitative metrics were investigated.",

            "abstract": "Crops’ production and quality of yields are heavily affected by crop diseases which cause adverse impacts on food security as well as economic losses. In India, agriculture is a prime source of income in most rural areas. Hence, there is an intense need to employ novel and accurate computer vision-based techniques for automatic crop disease detection and their classification so that prophylactic actions can be recommended in a timely manner. In literature, numerous computer vision-based techniques by utilizing divergent combinations of machine learning, deep learning, CNN, and various image-processing techniques along with their associated merits and demerits have already been discussed. In this study, we systematically reviewed recent research studies undertaken by a variety of scholars and researchers of fungal and bacterial plant disease detection and classification and summarized them based on vital parameters like type of crop utilized, deep learning/machine learning architecture used, dataset utilized for experiments, performance matrices, types of disease detected and classified, and highest accuracy achieved by the model. As per the analysis carried out, in the category of machine learning-based approaches, 70% of studies utilized real-field plant leaf images and 30% utilized laboratory condition plant leaf images for disease classification while in the case of deep learning-based approaches, 55% studied employed laboratory-conditioned images from the PlantVillage dataset, 25% utilized real-field images, and 20% utilized open image datasets. The average accuracy attained with deep learning-based approaches is quite higher at 98.8% as compared to machine learning-based approaches at 92.2%. In the case of deep learning-based methods, we also analyzed the performances of pretrained and training from scratch models that have been utilized in various studies for plant leaf disease classification. Pretrained models perform better with 99.64% classification accuracy compared to training from scratch models which achieved 98.64% average accuracy. We also highlighted some major issues encountered in the computer vision-based disease detection and classification approach used in literature and provided recommendations that will help and guide researchers to explore new dimensions in crop disease recognition.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture plays an essential role in Mexico’s economy. The agricultural sector has a 2.5% share of Mexico’s gross domestic product. Specifically, tomatoes have become the country’s most exported agricultural product. That is why there is an increasing need to improve crop yields. One of the elements that can considerably affect crop productivity is diseases caused by agents such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. However, the process of disease identification can be costly and, in many cases, time-consuming. Deep learning techniques have begun to be applied in the process of plant disease identification with promising results. In this paper, we propose a model based on convolutional neural networks to identify and classify tomato leaf diseases using a public dataset and complementing it with other photographs taken in the fields of the country. To avoid overfitting, generative adversarial networks were used to generate samples with the same characteristics as the training data. The results show that the proposed model achieves a high performance in the process of detection and classification of diseases in tomato leaves: the accuracy achieved is greater than 99% in both the training dataset and the test dataset.",

        "title": "SE-CapsNet: Automated evaluation of plant disease severity based on feature extraction through Squeeze and Excitation (SE) networks and Capsule networks",
        "abstract": "Diseases in plants harm the quantity of the overall food production as well as the quality of the yield. Early detection, diagnosis and treatment can greatly reduce losses, both economic and ecological. Intuitively, reduction in the use of agrochemicals due to timely detection of the disease, would greatly help in mitigating the environmental impact. In this paper, the authors have proposed an improved feature computation approach based on Squeeze and Excitation (SE) Networks, before processing by the original Capsule networks (CapsNet) for classification, for estimating the disease severity in plants. Two SE networks, one based on AlexNet and another on ResNet have been combined with Capsule networks. Leaf images for the devastating Late Blight disease occurring in the Tomato crop have been utilized from the PlantVillage dataset. The images, divided into four severity stages i.e. healthy, early, middle and end, are downscaled, enhanced and given as input to the SE networks. The feature maps generated from the two networks are separately given as input to the Capsule Network for classification and their performances are compared with the original CapsNet, on two image sizes 32X32 and 64X64. SE-Alex-CapsNet achieves the highest accuracy of 92.1% and SE-Res CapsNet achieves the highest accuracy of 93.75% with 64X64 image size, as compared to CapsNet that results in 85.53% accuracy. The classification accuracies of six state-of-the-art CNN models namely AlexNet, SqueezeNet, ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19 and Inception V3 are also presented for comparison purposes. Accuracy as well as precision, recall, F1-score, validation loss etc. measures have been recorded and compared. The findings have been validated by implementing the proposed approaches with another dataset, achieving similar resultant accuracy measures. The implementation was also accomplished with datasets after noise addition in six different variations, to verify the robustness of the proposed model. Based on the performances, the proposed techniques can be exploited for disease severity assessment in other crops as well and can be extended to other areas of applications such as plant species classification, weed identification etc. In addition to improved performance, with reduced image size, the proposed methodology can be utilized to create a mobile application requiring low processing capabilities, to be installed on reasonably priced smartphones for practical usage by farmers.",

We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.",

            "abstract": "Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.",

This paper is concerned with a new approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the use of deep convolutional networks. Novel way of training and the methodology used facilitate a quick and easy system implementation in practice. The developed model is able to recognize 13 different types of plant diseases out of healthy leaves, with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings. According to our knowledge, this method for plant disease recognition has been proposed for the first time. All essential steps required for implementing this disease recognition model are fully described throughout the paper, starting from gathering images in order to create a database, assessed by agricultural experts. Caffe, a deep learning framework developed by Berkley Vision and Learning Centre, was used to perform the deep CNN training. The experimental results on the developed model achieved precision between 91% and 98%, for separate class tests, on average 96.3%.",

To improve the identification accuracy of maize leaf diseases and reduce the number of network parameters, the improved GoogLeNet and Cifar10 models based on deep learning are proposed for leaf disease recognition in this paper. Two improved models that are used to train and test nine kinds of maize leaf images are obtained by adjusting the parameters, changing the pooling combinations, adding dropout operations and rectified linear unit functions, and reducing the number of classifiers. In addition, the number of parameters of the improved models is significantly smaller than that of the VGG and AlexNet structures. During the recognition of eight kinds of maize leaf diseases, the GoogLeNet model achieves a top - 1 average identification accuracy of 98.9%, and the Cifar10 model achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%. The improved methods are possibly improved the accuracy of maize leaf disease, and reduced the convergence iterations, which can effectively improve the model training and recognition efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently exhibited an excellent performance in hyperspectral image classification tasks. However, the straightforward CNN-based network architecture still finds obstacles when effectively exploiting the relationships between hyperspectral imaging (HSI) features in the spectral–spatial domain, which is a key factor to deal with the high level of complexity present in remotely sensed HSI data. Despite the fact that deeper architectures try to mitigate these limitations, they also find challenges with the convergence of the network parameters, which eventually limit the classification performance under highly demanding scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new CNN architecture based on spectral–spatial capsule networks in order to achieve a highly accurate classification of HSIs while significantly reducing the network design complexity. Specifically, based on Hinton’s capsule networks, we develop a CNN model extension that redefines the concept of capsule units to become spectral–spatial units specialized in classifying remotely sensed HSI data. The proposed model is composed by several building blocks, called spectral–spatial capsules, which are able to learn HSI spectral–spatial features considering their corresponding spatial positions in the scene, their associated spectral signatures, and also their possible transformations. Our experiments, conducted using five well-known HSI data sets and several state-of-the-art classification methods, reveal that our HSI classification approach based on spectral–spatial capsules is able to provide competitive advantages in terms of both classification accuracy and computational time.",

The success of P. infestans as a pathogen originates from its effective asexual and sexual life cycles, as well as its remarkable capacity to rapidly overcome plant resistance genes, a result of its high evolutionary potential. The most sustainable strategy to manage tomato LB would be to deploy an integrated system including cultural practices, fungicide application, and the use of cultivars with broad-spectrum genetic resistance against LB. Prior to the reemergence of LB in the late 1980s, cultural practices in combination with fungicide applications were highly effective measures to control the tomato LB. However, with the appearance of new and more aggressive isolates ofP. infestans, many ofwhich are resistant to LB-specific systemic fungicides, the greatest contribution to tomato LB control in the future will have to be through the development of cultivars with improved genetic resistance. Thus far, a number of major LB-resistance genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified in tomato and several breeding lines and cultivars, with improved resistance developed. Research is also underway to identify additional resistance genes or QTLs and to pyramid multiple resistance factors in order to develop stronger and more durable resistance. Further, as exemplified by the fast progress in potato LB research and conservation of LB signaling pathways between potato and tomato, detailed knowledge of the pathogen effectors in combination with high-throughput genomics technology will facilitate a better understanding of the LB disease and host-pathogen interactions, which in turn may lead to development of tomatoes with more durable resistance.",

Crop protection from biological/non-biological factors is a major hindrance for food security, plant diseases being one of the foremost challenges. Not only, plant diseases destroy the crops or diminish their overall quality, use of pesticides for their treatment renders the soil contaminated, which after a time becomes unsuitable for sowing and planting. Potato is a key crop and a major source of livelihood for a vast population. In this study, the authors have implemented capsule networks for classification of potato diseases, and compared the performance with few popular pretrained CNN models, namely ResNet18, VGG16 and GoogLeNet, implemented via transfer learning. Colored images of healthy as well as diseased leaf images were employed from the PlantVillage dataset and used for training the models. CapsNet proved to have achieved comparable performance to state-of-the-art CNN models, with 91.83% accuracy.",

In this study, a deep learning approach to recognizing artistic Arabic calligraphy types is presented. Autoencoder is a deep learning approach with the capability of reducing data dimensions in addition to extract features. Autoencoders could be stacked with several layers. The system is composed of three layers consisting of two encoder layers to extract features and a one soft max layer for the recognition stage. The font can be recognized in a collective manner based on the words or segments the exist in the font images. The input of the system consists of individual words or segment images that compose the font image, and the output is the recognized font type. The approach was evaluated on local and public datasets, and the achieved recognition rates were 92.1% and 99.5%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "As compared with the traditional visual discrimination methods, deep learning and image processing methods have the ability to detect plants efficiently and non-invasively. This is of great significance in the diagnosis and breeding of plant disease resistance phenotypes. Currently, the studies on plant diseases and pest stresses mainly focus on a leaf scale. There are only a few works regarding the stress detection at a complex canopy scale. In this work, three tea plant stresses with similar symptoms that cause a severe threat to the yield and quality of tea gardens, including the tea green leafhopper [Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda], anthracnose (Gloeosporium theae-sinensis Miyake), and sunburn (disease-like stress), are evaluated. In this work, a stress detection and segmentation method by fusing deep learning and image processing techniques at a canopy scale is proposed. First, a specified Faster RCNN algorithm is proposed for stress detection of tea plants at a canopy scale. After obtaining the stress detection boxes, a new feature, i.e., RGReLU, is proposed for the segmentation of tea plant stress scabs. Finally, the detection model at the canopy scale is transferred to a field scale by using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. The results show that the proposed method effectively achieves canopy-scale stress adaptive segmentation and outputs the scab type and corresponding damage ratio. The mean average precision (mAP) of the object detection reaches 76.07%, and the overall accuracy of the scab segmentation reaches 88.85%. In addition, the results also show that the proposed method has a strong generalization ability, and the model can be migrated and deployed to UAV scenarios. By fusing deep learning and image processing technology, the fine and quantitative results of canopy-scale stress monitoring can provide support for a wide range of scouting of tea garden.",

But pyramid representations have been avoided in recent object detectors that are based on deep convolutional networks, partially because they are slow to compute and memory intensive. In this paper, we exploit the inherent multi-scale, pyramidal hierarchy of deep convolutional networks to construct feature pyramids with marginal extra cost. A top-down architecture with lateral connections is developed for building high-level semantic feature maps at all scales. This architecture, called a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), shows significant improvement as a generic feature extractor in several applications. Using a basic Faster R-CNN system, our method achieves state-of-the-art single-model results on the COCO detection benchmark without bells and whistles, surpassing all existing single-model entries including those from the COCO 2016 challenge winners. In addition, our method can run at 5 FPS on a GPU and thus is a practical and accurate solution to multi-scale object detection. Code will be made publicly available.",

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",

            "abstract": "Tomato is affected by various diseases and pests during its growth process. If the control is not timely, it will lead to yield reduction or even crop failure. How to control the diseases and pests effectively and help the vegetable farmers to improve the yield of tomato is very important, and the most important thing is to accurately identify the diseases and insect pests. Compared with the traditional pattern recognition method, the diseases and pests recognition method based on deep learning can directly input the original image. Instead of the tedious steps such as image preprocessing, feature extraction and feature classification in the traditional method, the end-to-end structure is adopted to simplify the recognition process and solve the problem that the feature extractor designed manually is difficult to obtain the feature expression closest to the natural attribute of the object. Based on the application of deep learning object detection, not only can save time and effort, but also can achieve real-time judgment, greatly reduce the huge loss caused by diseases and pests, which has important research value and significance. Based on the latest research results of detection theory based on deep learning object detection and the characteristics of tomato diseases and pests images, this study will build the dataset of tomato diseases and pests under the real natural environment, optimize the feature layer of Yolo V3 model by using image pyramid to achieve multi-scale feature detection, improve the detection accuracy and speed of Yolo V3 model, and detect the location and category of diseases and pests of tomato accurately and quickly. Through the above research, the key technology of tomato pest image recognition in natural environment is broken through, which provides reference for intelligent recognition and engineering application of plant diseases and pests detection.",

        "title": "A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models for Guava Leaf Disease Detection",
        "abstract": "Plant diseases are regarded as one of the major variables affecting food production and reducing production losses. Early identification and disease diagnosis of fruit crops are essential for the food industry to increase production. The development of the healthy fruit sector is highly dependent on plant diseases. Guava fruit is a good source of fiber, calcium, pectins, and vitamin C. Guava disease has become a major issue for guava production, which has a negative impact on farmers' socioeconomic growth. Infections that harm guava plants and fruits pose the greatest obstacles, although they can be avoided by early identification. Deep learning has recently been widely used to automatically identify a variety of diseases that cannot be seen with the human eye. In this study, convolution neural models are suggested to use leaf images to detect guava disease. The presented models can be used to categorize the main guava leaf diseases, including Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. The kaggle dataset is used to gather images of guava with the disease Canker, Dot, Healthy, Mummification and Rust. In our work, CNN models like DenseNet121, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, and Xception are used to categorize the diseases that affect guava leaves. The experimental findings indicate that, with an accuracy of 96.12%, the DenseNet169 model outperformed other models. When the model's effectiveness is assessed using performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, the results demonstrate that DenseNet169 gives excellent results.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, overseas commerce has increased drastically in many countries. Plenty fruits are imported from the other nations such as oranges, apples etc. Manual identification of defected fruit is very time consuming. This work presents a novel defect segmentation of fruits based on color features with K-means clustering unsupervised algorithm. We used color images of fruits for defect segmentation. Defect segmentation is carried out into two stages. At first, the pixels are clustered based on their color and spatial features, where the clustering process is accomplished. Then the clustered blocks are merged to a specific number of regions. Using this two step procedure, it is possible to increase the computational efficiency avoiding feature extraction for every pixel in the image of fruits. Although the color is not commonly used for defect segmentation, it produces a high discriminative power for different regions of image. This approach thus provides a feasible robust solution for defect segmentation of fruits. We have taken apple as a case study and evaluated the proposed approach using defected apples. The experimental results clarify the effectiveness of proposed approach to improve the defect segmentation quality in aspects of precision and computational time. The simulation results reveal that the proposed approach is promising.",

In agriculture sectors, it is the most prominent challenge to recognize plant diseases. In computer vision, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) produces good results when solving image classification tasks. For plant disease diagnosis, many deep learning architectures have been applied. This paper introduces a transfer learning based model for detecting tomato leaf diseases. This study proposes a model of DenseNet201 as a transfer learning-based model and CNN classifier. A comparison study between four deep learning models (VGG16, Inception V3, ResNet152V2 and DenseNet201) done in order to determine the best accuracy in using transfer learning in plant disease detection. The used images dataset contains 22930 photos of tomato leaves in 10 different classes, 9 disorders and one healthy class. In our experimental, the results shows that the proposed model achieves the highest training accuracy of 99.84% and validation accuracy of 99.30%.",

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

Early detection can solve this problem and reduces the risk of decreasing plant production. The central focus of this study is to automatically detect tomato plant leaf diseases in a faster way by implementing Deep Learning (DL), which can be effectively applied for image classification using different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. This paper offers to classify images via transfer learning architectures including VGG-16, VGG-19, and Inception-V3 models with CNN to identify diseases. Applying these models on a dataset containing 11000 images of tomato leaves including signs of 9 different diseases and healthy leaf, high accuracy is gained. Finally, the comparative analysis done on the three pre-trained models within this paper summarizes that the best-suited model for detecting tomato leaf diseases with the best accuracy is Inception-V3. In order to support the claim, necessary results and data are also included in this paper.",

Diseases in plant leaves are considerable threat to plant health and productivity. Pathology expert perform manual identification of diseases which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and delayed detection can lead to serious crop loss. Early and accurate detection of diseases has to be done prefer ably. It is challenging to diagnosis diseases as leaves exhibit almost similar color, texture features. The focus is to identify and categorize plant leaf diseases with respect to five plant species apple, corn, grape, potato and tomato taken from PlantVillage dataset. These species are considered with over 25 classes that include healthy and diseased classes. The experiments are conducted by image processing techniques and Machine Learning (ML) models such as Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). All the above techniques are considered for comparison by performance evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. CNN outperforms here in plant disease detection by obtaining an accuracy of 95.37%, 93.92%, 98.00%, 97.10% and 94.88% with respect to apple, corn, grapes, potato and tomato crop leaves respectively.",

At the same time, Apple plants are among the plants that are the most prone to diseases. Disease identification at an early stage and its prevention before spreading into other parts of the plant is a challenge even for the expert’s eye. Therefore, an adequate system is required to detect plant disease in the initial stage. This paper displays the prowess of Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect and address the issue. Images of Apple leaves, covering various diseases as well as healthy samples, from the Plant Village dataset are used to validate results. Image filtering, image compression, and image generation techniques are used to gain a large train-set of images and tune the system perfectly. The trained model achieves high accuracy scores in all the classes with a net accuracy of 98.54% on the entire dataset, sampled and generated from 2561-labelled images.",

            "abstract": "Anthracnose, brown spot, mites, black rot, downy mildew, and leaf blight are six common grape leaf pests and diseases, which cause severe economic losses to the grape industry. Timely diagnosis and accurate identification of grape leaf diseases are decisive for controlling the spread of disease and ensuring the healthy development of the grape industry. This paper proposes a novel recognition approach that is based on improved convolutional neural networks for the diagnoses of grape leaf diseases. First, based on 4,023 images collected in the field and 3,646 images collected from public data sets, a data set of 107,366 grape leaf images is generated via image enhancement techniques. Afterward, Inception structure is applied for strengthening the performance of multi-dimensional feature extraction. In addition, a dense connectivity strategy is introduced to encourage feature reuse and strengthen feature propagation. Ultimately, a novel CNN-based model, namely, DICNN, is built and trained from scratch. It realizes an overall accuracy of 97.22% under the hold-out test set. Compared to GoogLeNet and ResNet-34, the recognition accuracy increases by 2.97% and 2.55%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently recognize grape leaf diseases. Meanwhile, this study explores a new approach for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases that establishes a theoretical foundation for the application of deep learning in the field of agricultural information.",

In MCNN, Inception is introduced into MCNN, global average pooling (GAP) operator is employed instead of several fully connected layers to speedup training model, and modified Softmax classifier is used in the output layer to improve the recognition performance. The modified Softmax classifier uses the modified linear element as the activation function in the hidden layer and adds the local response normalization in MCNN to avoid the gradient disappearance problem effectively.

The research focuses on publications between 2015 and 2022, and the experiments discussed in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of using these techniques in improving the accuracy and efficiency of plant disease detection. This study also addresses the challenges and limitations associated with using ML and DL for plant disease identification, such as issues with data availability, imaging quality, and the differentiation between healthy and diseased plants. The research provides valuable insights for plant disease detection researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals by offering solutions to these challenges and limitations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research in this field, highlighting the benefits and limitations of these methods, and proposing potential solutions to overcome the challenges of their implementation.",

            "abstract": "Potatoes are an agricultural product that has the fourth highest content of wheat flour after corn, wheat, and rice. Although potatoes play a critical role in agriculture, this crop is susceptible to various diseases and pests. There are several potato leaf diseases that are not yet known to farmers. Dry spot potato leaf disease (late blight) and late blight. If not treated, this disease on potato leaves will spread to the stem and reduce crop yields, causing crop failure. By using technology in the form of digital image processing, this problem can be overcome. This research proposes an appropriate method for detecting disease in potato leaves. Classification will be carried out in three classes, namel, Early Blight, Healthy and Late Blight using the Deep Learning method of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The data used comes from an online dataset via the kaggle.com page with the file name Potato Disease Leaf Dataset (PLD) totaling 3251 training datasets which are then divided into training, testing, and validation. The processes carried out are image pre-processing, image augmentation, then image processing using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the classification process using the CNN method with RMSprop optimizer, the accuracy was 97.53% with a loss value of 0.1096.",

            "abstract": "One of the essential components of human civilization is agriculture. It helps the economy in addition to supplying food. Plant leaves or crops are vulnerable to different diseases during agricultural cultivation. The diseases halt the growth of their respective species. Early and precise detection and classification of the diseases may reduce the chance of additional damage to the plants. The detection and classification of these diseases have become serious problems. Farmers’ typical way of predicting and classifying plant leaf diseases can be boring and erroneous. Problems may arise when attempting to predict the types of diseases manually. The inability to detect and classify plant diseases quickly may result in the destruction of crop plants, resulting in a significant decrease in products. Farmers that use computerized image processing methods in their fields can reduce losses and increase productivity. Numerous techniques have been adopted and applied in the detection and classification of plant diseases based on images of infected leaves or crops. Researchers have made significant progress in the detection and classification of diseases in the past by exploring various techniques. However, improvements are required as a result of reviews, new advancements, and discussions. The use of technology can significantly increase crop production all around the world. Previous research has determined the robustness of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques such as k-means clustering (KMC), naive Bayes (NB), feed-forward neural network (FFNN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, fuzzy logic (FL), genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and so on. Here, from the DL and ML techniques that have been included in this particular study, CNNs are often the favored choice for image detection and classification due to their inherent capacity to autonomously acquire pertinent image features and grasp spatial hierarchies. Nevertheless, the selection between conventional ML and DL hinges upon the particular problem, the accessibility of data, and the computational capabilities accessible. Accordingly, in numerous advanced image detection and classification tasks, DL, mainly through CNNs, is preferred when ample data and computational resources are available and show good detection and classification effects on their datasets, but not on other datasets. Finally, in this paper, the author aims to keep future researchers up-to-date with the performances, evaluation metrics, and results of previously used techniques to detect and classify different forms of plant leaf or crop diseases using various image-processing techniques in the artificial intelligence (AI) field.",

Like human being, plants are also infected by various disease that are resulted from virus, bacteria, and fungi. It is necessary to identify these diseases in time and cure them immediately to counteract the destruction of whole plant. In recent times, deep learning networks have attained tremendous improvement in classifying image and detecting object. Therefore, in our research, some pre-trained Convolution Neural Networks (AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19) have been utilised along with transfer learning for detecting plant diseases. First of all, pre-processing technique has been applied to improve image quality and increase the accuracy. After the training process, testing has been done for validating the results. To train these models, PlantVillage dataset has been used which contains both diseased and healthy leaves. 80% data has been utilised in training step and other 20% has been used in testing. In this research, precision, recall and f1-score are also computed besides the accuracy. Using AlexNet, VGG16, and VGG19 96.63%, 95.05%, and 95.22% testing accuracy have been achieved respectively. As we can see that among all models the modified AlexNet performed best and got 96.63% as accuracy, 92 % as precision, 91 % as recall, and 91 % as f1-score.",

However, diseases like early blight and late blight are impeding potato production and driving up production costs. To boost potato production and digitize the system, the goal is to create an automated and quick disease detection method. Our primary objective is to use leaf images to diagnose potato disease using the CNN algorithm. This paper provides a visual representation of how automated systems based on machine learning will identify and categorize potato leaf diseases. The most effective method for identifying and analyzing these disorders is image processing. In this analysis, picture division is carried out; over 2000 images of healthy and unhealthy potato leaf are taken from Kaggle, and a few pre-made models are used to identify and classify healthy and diseased leaves. With 30% test data and 70% train data, the algorithm successfully predicts one of them with an accuracy of 91.41% in testing. Our results demonstrate that CNN outperforms all currently available tasks for detecting potato disease.

Climatic and other environmental changes have become a major threat to agriculture. Grapes are a well-known fruit crop in India and are considered very important from a commercial point of view. However, there is a loss of 10-30% in grapes due to diseases. Grape diseases can cause significant losses to farmers and their grape production if not detected and treated early. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, leaf blight, Esca and black rot are the major grape diseases. Machine learning is a very effective solution to solve this problem. According to our research, convolutional neural network (CNN) is the most popular deep learning algorithm widely used in plant disease detection. In this paper, we did comparative analysis between CNN and AlexNet architecture to detect the diseases in grape plant and compared the accuracy and efficiency between these architectures. We used CNN algorithm and achieved an accuracy of 95.84% and AlexNet is a kind of CNN architecture used and achieved an excellent accuracy of 98.03%. The final result shows that the AlexNet architecture obtained higher accuracy than the CNN algorithm. In this work, an Android application has been designed to detect grape disease. When a farmer captures or uploads a photo of a diseased grape leaf, the mobile app predicts the disease and offers solutions to reduce the risk of the disease.",

In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. \nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

Dalam melakukan pengendalian hama, sebagian besar petani melakukan aplikasi insektisida secara tidak bijaksana sehingga mengakibatkan terbunuhnya organisme bukan sasaran. Beberapa peneliti telah mencoba mengklasifikasi kerusakan pada tanaman alih-alih mengklasifikasikan hama itu sendiri.  Oleh karena itu, dengan mengklasifikasikan jenis hama pada tanaman padi memungkinkan petani melakukan penanganan sesegera mungkin pada tanaman padi sesuai jenis hama yang menyerangnya. Metode Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) banyak digunakan dalam image processing karena tingkat akurasinya yang tinggi dan lebih baik dalam pengenalan gambar. Metode CNN pada beberapa penelitian mengalami masalah overfitting. Penelitian ini mengusulkan penerapan tiga jenis pembagian data training dan data testing juga penggunaan penggunaan beberapa parameter yang berfungsi mengurangi masalah overfitting. Berdasarkan evaluasi, pembagian data 90%:10% adalah pembagian data yang paling cocok untuk dataset dan arsitektur yang digunakan dengan akurasi training 83,02%, 78,30%, dan 81,13%.

        "abstract": "Tomato cultivation is crucial to global agriculture, yet it is highly vulnerable to a variety of diseases and pests that significantly affect both yield and quality. In particular, fungal infections, viral pathogens like Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, and bacterial diseases such as Late Blight, are common threats that impair production. Effective and timely detection of these diseases is essential to minimize crop loss and ensure higher yields. This research explores the application of the EfficientNet-B3 deep learning model for the classification and early detection of tomato leaf diseases. By employing state-of-the-art image processing techniques and deep learning architectures, this study aims to develop a robust detection system that identifies diseased tomato leaves with high accuracy. We used the Plant Village dataset for training and testing purposes, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 99%, surpassing several traditional machine learning models. In addition to detecting and classifying diseases, the proposed system provides precautionary tips to help farmers take timely actions and prevent further spread. This scalable and computationally efficient solution leverages FastAPI to ensure high performance, assisting in early disease detection and management for improved agricultural outcomes. Furthermore, this paper discusses the importance of dataset quality, compares the model's performance with other deep learning approaches, and highlights future avenues for enhancing classification systems in agricultural settings.",

            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

            "abstract": "Plant diseases are one of the grand challenges that face the agriculture sector worldwide. In the United States, crop diseases cause losses of one-third of crop production annually. Despite the importance, crop disease diagnosis is challenging for limited-resources farmers if performed through optical observation of plant leaves’ symptoms. Therefore, there is an urgent need for markedly improved detection, monitoring, and prediction of crop diseases to reduce crop agriculture losses. Computer vision empowered with Machine Learning (ML) has tremendous promise for improving crop monitoring at scale in this context. This paper presents an ML-powered mobile-based system to automate the plant leaf disease diagnosis process. The developed system uses Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) as an underlying deep learning engine for classifying 38 disease categories. We collected an imagery dataset containing 96,206 images of plant leaves of healthy and infected plants for training, validating, and testing the CNN model. The user interface is developed as an Android mobile app, allowing farmers to capture a photo of the infected plant leaves. It then displays the disease category along with the confidence percentage. It is expected that this system would create a better opportunity for farmers to keep their crops healthy and eliminate the use of wrong fertilizers that could stress the plants. Finally, we evaluated our system using various performance metrics such as classification accuracy and processing time. We found that our model achieves an overall classification accuracy of 94% in recognizing the most common 38 disease classes in 14 crop species.",

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to effectively define and classify tomato diseases. Google Colab is used to conduct the complete experiment with a dataset containing 3000 images of tomato leaves affected by nine different diseases and a healthy leaf. The complete process is described: Firstly, the input images are preprocessed, and the targeted area of images are segmented from the original images. Secondly, the images are further processed with varying hyper-parameters of the CNN model. Finally, CNN extracts other characteristics from pictures like colors, texture, and edges, etc. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model predictions are 98.49% accurate.",

            "abstract": "The detection of diseases in tomatoes in advance and early intervention and treatment increase the production amount, efficiency, and quality, which will satisfy the consumer with a more affordable shelf price. Thus, the efforts of farmers waiting for harvests throughout the season are not wasted. In this study, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for a disease identification task in which the network comprises only six layers, which is why it is computationally inexpensive in terms of the parameters employed in the network. This network was trained using PlantVillage’s tomato crop dataset, which consisted of 10 classes (nine diseases and one healthy). The proposed network was first compared with the well-known pre-trained ImageNet deep networks using a transfer learning approach. The results show that the proposed network performs better than pre-trained knowledge transferred deep network models, and that there is no need to constitute very large, complicated network architectures to achieve superior tomato disease identification performance. Furthermore, data augmentation techniques are employed during network training to improve the performance of the proposed network. The proposed network achieved an accuracy of the $F_{1}$ score, Matthews correlation coefficient, true positive rate, and true negative rate of 99.70%, 98.49%, 98.31%, 98.49%, and 99.81%, respectively, using 9,077 unseen test images. Our results are better than or similar to those of state-of-the-art deep neural network approaches that use the PlantVillage database and the proposed method employs the cheapest architecture.",

        "abstract": "All people have access to food thanks to agriculture, even in areas with rapid population expansion. In order to ensure that the entire population has access to food, early diagnosis of plant diseases is recommended. However, when crops are still maturing, it might be challenging to predict diseases. The goal of this paper is to inform farmers about the use of machine learning to recognize various pest species in various crop plants. Deep learning establishes a continuing, cutting-edge method for analysing images with significant potential and promising outcomes. DL has expanded into the field of agriculture after demonstrating its effectiveness in a number of applications. Here, we reviewed various research articles that used deep learning methods to address diverse research issues in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. We look at the study areas in tomato plants where deep learning, data preprocessing, transfer learning, and augmentation approaches are performed. studied dataset details, including the number of photos, classes, and train test to validation ratios that were employed. We also look at comparisons made across different deep learning architectures and analyse the results. The results demonstrated that deep learning techniques beat all other image processing methods, however how well DL works depended on the dataset employed.",

            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) are a very promising branch of technology, and they have been utilized in agriculture—in cooperation with image processing technologies—for phenotyping and vigor diagnosis. One of the problems in the utilization of UAVs for agricultural purposes is the limitation in flight time. It is necessary to fly at a high altitude to capture the maximum number of plants in the limited time available, but this reduces the spatial resolution of the captured images. In this study, we applied a super-resolution method to the low-resolution images of tomato diseases to recover detailed appearances, such as lesions on plant organs. We also conducted disease classification using high-resolution, low-resolution, and super-resolution images to evaluate the effectiveness of super-resolution methods in disease classification. Our results indicated that the super-resolution method outperformed conventional image scaling methods in spatial resolution enhancement of tomato disease images. The results of disease classification showed that the accuracy attained was also better by a large margin with super-resolution images than with low-resolution images. These results indicated that our approach not only recovered the information lost in low-resolution images, but also exerted a beneficial influence on further image analysis. The proposed approach will accelerate image-based phenotyping and vigor diagnosis in the field, because it not only saves time to capture images of a crop in a cultivation field but also secures the accuracy of these images for further analysis.",

This tremendous rise in population will demand for an increase in the production as well as consumption of food.

The rapid identification of the diseases that affect the crops remains difficult in different parts of the world due to the limited availability of infrastructure. To help in agriculture, this research uses computer vision technology and deep learning methods for assisting prediction of diseases of crops. A deep convolutional neural network (DNN) is trained on a public dataset of 54,306 images consisting of both diseased as well as healthy plant leaves. The model is trained on the train set and is validated using the validation split of data. The trained model has achieved an accuracy of 99.24% and can identify 14 crop species and 26 diseases. As a concrete deliverable of this research dCrop is made available as a smartphone app which is built using the trained disease prediction model. The farmer can capture the crop images using the app and analyze the presence or absence of diseases, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the solution.",

Due to the substantial population growth, meeting people’s dietary needs has become a relevant concern. The transition to smart agriculture has become inevitable to achieve these food security goals. In recent years, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), have been intensely researched and applied in various fields, including agriculture. This study analyzed the recent research articles on deep learning techniques in agriculture over the previous five years and discussed the most important contributions and the challenges that have been solved. Furthermore, we investigated the agriculture parameters being monitored by the internet of things and used them to feed the deep learning algorithm for analysis. Additionally, we compared different studies regarding focused agriculture area, problems solved, the dataset used, the deep learning model used, the framework used, data preprocessing and augmentation method, and results with accuracy. We concluded in this survey that although CNN provides better results, it lacks in early detection of plant diseases. To cope with this issue, we proposed an intelligent agriculture system based on a hybrid model of CNN and SVM, capable of detecting and classifying plant leaves disease early.",

While many research works have been inspired by the success of deep learning in computer vision to improve the performance of recognition systems for crop diseases, few of these studies optimized the deep learning models to generalize their findings to practical use in the field. In this work, we proposed a model for identifying tomato leaf diseases based on both in-house data and public tomato leaf images databases. Three deep learning network architectures (VGG16, Inception_v3, and Resnet50) were trained and tested. We packaged the trained model into an Android application named TomatoGuard to identify nine kinds of tomato leaf diseases and healthy tomato leaf. The results showed that TomatoGuard could be adopted as a model for identifying tomato diseases with a 99% test accuracy, showing significantly better performance compared with APP Plantix, a widely used APP for general purpose plant disease detection.",

            "abstract": "The economic prosperity of a country is highly dependent on agriculture. The use of technology in agriculture has greatly contributed to the economic prosperity of industrialized countries and is crucial for the growth of emerging countries. One major challenge in agriculture is the detection and control of plant diseases, which can greatly affect food production and population well-being. Plant illnesses have a substantial effect on plant productivity and quality. The detection of various types of diseases in plants with bare eyes is time consuming and a difficult task with little precision. Mainly our primary concern is tomato crops. The economic demand for tomatoes has grown dramatically over time. The complicated task of controlling tomato infection requires ongoing care during the crop cycle and consumes a considerable amount of the total cost of production. To classify tomato diseases, we made the use of the pretrained deep neural networks and automation, which are crucial for this method. Digital image processing can be used to monitor plant disease. Deep learning has made remarkable improvements in digital image processing in recent years, surpassing the older techniques. This article identifies tomato leaf disease using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning. The CNN’s backbone comprises AlexNet, ResNet, VGG-16, and DenseNet. The Adam and RmsProp optimization methods examine these networks’ relative performance, demonstrating that the DenseNet model with the RmsProp optimization approach achieves the most significant outcomes with the best accuracy of 99.9%.",

        "abstract": "Black gram plant leaf disease can cause significant crop yield reductions, resulting in economic losses and affecting food security as well as impacting agricultural sustainability. Early detection of black gram plant leaf disease is essential for reducing losses and maintaining crop quality. In recent years, advanced approaches in deep learning and computer vision algorithms have become promising tools for automated plant disease identification. In this study, we have applied a convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture called BPLD-10 to deal with the problem of detecting black gram plant leaf disease. Utilising the Black gram Plant Leaf Disease (BPLD) dataset, which contains 1000 high resolution images classified into five classes, including a healthy leave and four disease types, this paper focuses on enhancing the model overall accuracy and effectiveness. We have initiated the process by applying normalisation image preprocessing techniques for optimising disease detection as well as data augmentation methods for dataset balance and model robustness. The proposed CNN model named BPLD-10 beat existing state-of-the-art models, obtaining a stunning test accuracy of 98.66%. This research helps to early disease diagnosis by providing an efficient and reliable approach to black gram plant leaf disease detection, enabling farmers to take early steps and enhance crop yields.",

A whole color cucumber leaf image is inputted into the convolutional neural network of the Mask R-CNN model, thereafter, the extracted features in their map are passed to the region proposal network for region proposals, the proposed regions of interest in their unaligned form are aligned before passing them to the fully connected layers in a fixed size feature map for the following actions: (1) bounding boxing, classification, and masking. The experimental results obtained in this work are on a par with the results obtained in literature, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method and high practical value for plant growth monitoring.",

A tree may generate a substantial yield in a few months and has a lifetime of around 70 to 80 years. Yet, in addition to the benefits, there are certain constraints to its cultivation. With the exception of parasites and algae, anthracnose is the most common disease affecting trees. When it comes to cashew, the dense structure of the tree makes it difficult to diagnose the disease with ease compared to short crops. Hence, we present a dataset that exclusively consists of healthy and diseased cashew leaves and fruits. The dataset is authenticated by adding RGB color transformation to highlight diseased regions, photometric and geometric augmentations, and RaLSGAN to enlarge the initial collection of images and boost performance in real-time situations when working with a constrained dataset. Further, transfer learning is used to test the classification efficiency of the dataset using algorithms such as MobileNet and Inception. TensorFlow lite is utilized to develop these algorithms for disease diagnosis utilizing drones in real-time.

To address the pressing concern of Black Gram Plant Leaf Diseases (BPLD), this research endeavors to tackle disease classification through the application of a deep learning methodology. The approach leverages a comprehensive dataset that encompasses Anthracnose, Leaf Crinkle, Powdery Mildew, and Yellow Mosaic diseases, all of which affect the black gram crop. By employing this advanced technique, we aim to contribute valuable insights to combat BPLD effectively. Our research applies deep learning models, including Darknet-53, ResNet-101, GoogLeNet, and EfficientNet-B0, to classify plant diseases. Darknet-53 achieved 98.51% accuracy, followed by ResNet-101 (97.51%), GoogLeNet (96.52%), and EfficientNet-B0 (77.61%). These findings demonstrate the potential of deep learning for accurate disease identification, benefiting agriculture. The study provides a comparative analysis of deep learning models for Black Gram Plant Leaf Disease (BPLD) classification, revealing Darknet-53 and ResNet-101 as superior performers. Implementing these models in real-world agricultural scenarios holds promise for early disease detection and intervention, reducing potential crop losses. The high accuracy achieved signifies significant progress in automating disease recognition, benefiting the agricultural sector.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Agriculture is a crucial sector for every country’s economy, as it provides livestock and crops that are essential for farmers and their families’ survival. Crop diseases significantly impact farmers’ livelihood, making early detection and accurate diagnosis essential for informed crop management decisions that can improve yield and crop quality. While the manual diagnosis of plant diseases has limitations, research on automatic plant disease identification and categorization using computer vision algorithms is a popular research topic. We focus on leaf disease recognition and compare classification techniques to object detection techniques. Classification techniques in leaf disease recognition involve assigning an input image of a leaf to one of the pre-defined classes or categories, such as “healthy” or “diseased.” Object detection techniques, on the other hand, involve identifying the presence of an object of interest (e.g., a leaf) in an image and locating its boundaries, in addition to classifying the object. The advantage of object detection techniques over classification techniques in leaf disease recognition is that they provide additional information about the location of the disease on the leaf, which can be useful for tasks such as disease diagnosis and monitoring. In our work, 5100 chilli leaf images of 6 different classes were collected and labeled using the makeSense artificial intelligence (AI) annotating tool; we applied the YOLOv5s object detection model, producing a precision of 0.951, recall of 0.926, mAP@0.5 of 0.959, mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.826, and accuracy of 95%. We also proposed an enhanced single-stage object detection model that employs the exponential linear unit activation function in the convolution layers and the sigmoid activation function at the output layer, resulting in a precision of 0.998, recall of 0.998, mAP@0.5 of 0.995, mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.975, and accuracy of 99.83% for the chilli leaf dataset.",

            "abstract": "Plant Diseases and Pests are a major challenge in the agriculture sector. An accurate and a faster detection of diseases and pests in plants could help to develop an early treatment technique while substantially reducing economic losses. Recent developments in Deep Neural Networks have allowed researchers to drastically improve the accuracy of object detection and recognition systems. In this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect diseases and pests in tomato plants using images captured in-place by camera devices with various resolutions. Our goal is to find the more suitable deep-learning architecture for our task. Therefore, we consider three main families of detectors: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), which for the purpose of this work are called “deep learning meta-architectures”. We combine each of these meta-architectures with “deep feature extractors” such as VGG net and Residual Network (ResNet). We demonstrate the performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and additionally propose a method for local and global class annotation and data augmentation to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives during training. We train and test our systems end-to-end on our large Tomato Diseases and Pests Dataset, which contains challenging images with diseases and pests, including several inter- and extra-class variations, such as infection status and location in the plant. Experimental results show that our proposed system can effectively recognize nine different types of diseases and pests, with the ability to deal with complex scenarios from a plant’s surrounding area.",

To improve the identification accuracy of maize leaf diseases and reduce the number of network parameters, the improved GoogLeNet and Cifar10 models based on deep learning are proposed for leaf disease recognition in this paper. Two improved models that are used to train and test nine kinds of maize leaf images are obtained by adjusting the parameters, changing the pooling combinations, adding dropout operations and rectified linear unit functions, and reducing the number of classifiers. In addition, the number of parameters of the improved models is significantly smaller than that of the VGG and AlexNet structures. During the recognition of eight kinds of maize leaf diseases, the GoogLeNet model achieves a top - 1 average identification accuracy of 98.9%, and the Cifar10 model achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%. The improved methods are possibly improved the accuracy of maize leaf disease, and reduced the convergence iterations, which can effectively improve the model training and recognition efficiency.",

Deep learning methods have become the main research direction to solve the diagnosis of crop diseases. This paper proposed a deep convolutional neural network that integrates an attention mechanism, which can better adapt to the diagnosis of a variety of tomato leaf diseases. The network structure mainly includes residual blocks and attention extraction modules. The model can accurately extract complex features of various diseases. Extensive comparative experiment results show that the proposed model achieves the average identification accuracy of 96.81% on the tomato leaf diseases dataset. It proves that the model has significant advantages in terms of network complexity and real-time performance compared with other models. Moreover, through the model comparison experiment on the grape leaf diseases public dataset, the proposed model also achieves better results, and the average identification accuracy of 99.24%. It is certified that add the attention module can more accurately extract the complex features of a variety of diseases and has fewer parameters. The proposed model provides a high-performance solution for crop diagnosis under the real agricultural environment.",

This potency has stimulated the use of UAVs with object detection functionality in numerous crucial real-life applications. Additionally, more efficient and accurate object detection techniques are being researched and developed for usage in UAV applications. However, object detection in UAVs presents challenges that are not common to general object detection. First, as UAVs fly at varying altitudes, the objects imaged via UAVs vary vastly in size, making the task at hand more challenging. Second due to the motion of the UAVs, there could be a presence of blur in the captured images. To deal with these challenges, we present a You Only Look Once v5 (YOLOv5)-like architecture with ConvMixers in its prediction heads and an additional prediction head to deal with minutely-small objects. The proposed architecture has been trained and tested on the VisDrone 2021 dataset, and the acquired results are comparable with the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "The wide scale prevalence of diseases in agricultural crops affects both the production quality and quantity of agricultural products at local to regional scale. More often than not, the diseases remain unidentified causing huge distress to the farmers while threatening national food security. In order to circumvent this problem, early diagnosis of diseases using a fast and reliable method is beneficial. Plant disease identification from images captured by digital cameras is an area of active research. Use of various machine learning algorithms for plant disease classification and the evolution of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based architectures have further enhanced the plant disease classification accuracy. In this context, an automated computer vision-based plant disease detection and classification scheme from plant and leaf’s photographs will be highly desirable. Although, there exist a few techniques currently used in an adhoc fashion for plant disease detection and/or classification, a systematic study to evaluate their usage and efficacy on actual plant data has largely remained unexplored.The aim of this paper is to evaluate various CNN based state-of-the-art transfer learning architectures like GoogLeNet, AlexNet, VGG16 and ResNet50V2 models for plant disease detection and classification. The models were tested on popular publicly available three plant disease benchmark database such as PlantVillage Dataset, New Plant Disease Dataset and Plant Pathology Dataset. Various validation metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 score and overall accuracy were used to evaluate the final results of the experiments, which revealed that VGG16 rendered highest accuracy of 96.6%, 98.5% and 89% on the three dataset respectively, outperforming all other state-of-the-art models.",

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.",

In this paper, we explore the possibility of computer vision approaches for scalable and early plant disease detection. The lack of availability of sufficiently large-scale non-lab data set remains a major challenge for enabling vision based plant disease detection. Against this background, we present PlantDoc: a dataset for visual plant disease detection. Our dataset contains 2,598 data points in total across 13 plant species and up to 17 classes of diseases, involving approximately 300 human hours of effort in annotating internet scraped images. To show the efficacy of our dataset, we learn 3 models for the task of plant disease classification. Our results show that modelling using our dataset can increase the classification accuracy by up to 31%. We believe that our dataset can help reduce the entry barrier of computer vision techniques in plant disease detection.",

Appropriate and timely deployment of disease management depends on early disease detection.

We have manually captured 3,651 high-quality, real-life symptom images of multiple apple foliar diseases, with variable illumination, angles, surfaces, and noise. A subset, expert-annotated to create a pilot dataset for apple scab, cedar apple rust, and healthy leaves, was made available to the Kaggle community for 'Plant Pathology Challenge'; part of the Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) workshop at CVPR 2020 (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition). We also trained an off-the-shelf convolutional neural network (CNN) on this data for disease classification and achieved 97% accuracy on a held-out test set. This dataset will contribute towards development and deployment of machine learning-based automated plant disease classification algorithms to ultimately realize fast and accurate disease detection. We will continue to add images to the pilot dataset for a larger, more comprehensive expert-annotated dataset for future Kaggle competitions and to explore more advanced methods for disease classification and quantification.",

Early detection of the diseases helps provide a cure that can restrict the spread of the diseases within the plant. This review provides a framework for classifying plants as diseased/healthy based on leaf health using various deep learning models such as ResNet50, InceptionV3, ResNet152V2, and AlexNet and implementing those models on two different datasets, namely cotton and plant village datasets, improved respective performance. The experimental results show that the proposed models for plant disease detection and management using ResNet50, InceptionV3, ResNet152V2, and AlexNet perform well to provide a feasible solution for predicting disease among various plant leaves. But with the use of ResNet152V2 as compared to other classifiers, which gives an accuracy of 100% on the cotton dataset and 94.32% with the plant village dataset in search of the healthy or diseased plant additional to that if detected leaves are diseased, the model provides information on each disease and feasible solution. The results demonstrate that the proposed prediction mechanism represents a new effective way to predict diseases with better accuracy. The models were deployed to a web application using a flask to give users a medium to interact and utilize the mechanism.",

        "title": "Rapid Grapevine Health Diagnosis Based on Digital Imaging and Deep Learning",
        "abstract": "Deep learning plays a vital role in precise grapevine disease detection, yet practical applications for farmer assistance are scarce despite promising results. The objective of this research is to develop an intelligent approach, supported by user-friendly, open-source software named AI GrapeCare (Version 1, created by Osama Elsherbiny). This approach utilizes RGB imagery and hybrid deep networks for the detection and prevention of grapevine diseases. Exploring the optimal deep learning architecture involved combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), deep neural networks (DNNs), and transfer learning networks (including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and ResNet101V2). A gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was employed to measure the textural characteristics. The plant disease detection platform (PDD) created a dataset of real-life grape leaf images from vineyards to improve plant disease identification. A data augmentation technique was applied to address the issue of limited images. Subsequently, the augmented dataset was used to train the models and enhance their capability to accurately identify and classify plant diseases in real-world scenarios. The analyzed outcomes indicated that the combined CNNRGB-LSTMGLCM deep network, based on the VGG16 pretrained network and data augmentation, outperformed the separate deep network and nonaugmented version features. Its validation accuracy, classification precision, recall, and F-measure are all 96.6%, with a 93.4% intersection over union and a loss of 0.123. Furthermore, the software developed through the proposed approach holds great promise as a rapid tool for diagnosing grapevine diseases in less than one minute. The framework of the study shows potential for future expansion to include various types of trees. This capability can assist farmers in early detection of tree diseases, enabling them to implement preventive measures.",

This study also analyzed the physical and physicochemical characteristics of fruits that were treated preharvest during standard season production and off season production. Concentrations of 0 (absolute control), 1, 5, 10 and 20 ml L-1 culture filtrate were tested. The standard treatments that were used as controls were bordeaux mixture, mancozeb, acibenzolar-S-methyl and Agaricus blazei. In the case of downy mildew, the concentrations reached a control of approximately 56% compared to that of the absolute control treatment during both seasons. The reduction of the isariopsis leaf spot was approximately 54 and 42% in the standard season and off season, respectively. The severity of fruit mildew was controlled in 62% of the cases, but the incidence was controlled in approximately 11% of the cases. Postharvest, the pH and relationship between solids and acidity (TSS/TTA) of the fruit pulp remained in the ideal range, the fruits showed low juice yield and high total titratable acidity, and the bunch weight, number of bunches and yield per plant were higher in the off season than in standard season and were affected by weather conditions and the pruning season. \n \n   \n \n Key words: Vitis labrusca, biological control, agro-ecology, organic production.",

Part of this success can be attributed to the reliance on big data to increase generalization. However, in the field of time series recognition, many datasets are often very small. One method of addressing this problem is through the use of data augmentation. In this paper, we survey data augmentation techniques for time series and their application to time series classification with neural networks. We propose a taxonomy and outline the four families in time series data augmentation, including transformation-based methods, pattern mixing, generative models, and decomposition methods. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate 12 time series data augmentation methods on 128 time series classification datasets with six different types of neural networks. Through the results, we are able to analyze the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and recommendations of each data augmentation method. This survey aims to help in the selection of time series data augmentation for neural network applications.",

            "abstract": "The strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) is a high-value crop with an annual cultivated area of ~500 ha in Taiwan. Over 90% of strawberry cultivation is in Miaoli County. Unfortunately, various diseases significantly decrease strawberry production. The leaf and fruit disease became an epidemic in 1986. From 2010 to 2016, anthracnose crown rot caused the loss of 30–40% of seedlings and ~20% of plants after transplanting. The automation of agriculture and image recognition techniques are indispensable for detecting strawberry diseases. We developed an image recognition technique for the detection of strawberry diseases using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. CNN is a powerful deep learning approach that has been used to enhance image recognition. In the proposed technique, two different datasets containing the original and feature images are used for detecting the following strawberry diseases—leaf blight, gray mold, and powdery mildew. Specifically, leaf blight may affect the crown, leaf, and fruit and show different symptoms. By using the ResNet50 model with a training period of 20 epochs for 1306 feature images, the proposed CNN model achieves a classification accuracy rate of 100% for leaf blight cases affecting the crown, leaf, and fruit; 98% for gray mold cases, and 98% for powdery mildew cases. In 20 epochs, the accuracy rate of 99.60% obtained from the feature image dataset was higher than that of 1.53% obtained from the original one. This proposed model provides a simple, reliable, and cost-effective technique for detecting strawberry diseases.",

        "abstract": "Agriculture has a dominant role in the world’s economy. However, losses due to crop diseases and pests significantly affect the contribution made by the agricultural sector. Plant diseases and pests recognized at an early stage can help limit the economic losses in agriculture production around the world. In this paper, a comprehensive multilayer convolutional neural network (CMCNN) is developed for plant disease detection that can analyze the visible symptoms on a variety of leaf images like, laboratory images with a plain background, complex images with real field conditions and images of individual disease symptoms or spots. The model performance is evaluated on three public datasets -Plant Village repository having images of the whole leaf with plain background, Plant Village repository with complex background and Digipathos repository with images of lone lesions and spots. Hyperparameters like learning rate, dropout probability, and optimizer are fine-tuned such that the model is capable of classifying various types of input leaf images. The overall classification accuracy of the model in handling laboratory images is 99.85%, real field condition images is 98.16% and for images with individual disease symptoms is 99.6%. The proposed design is also compared with the popular CNN architectures like GoogleNet, VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50. The experimental results indicate that the suggested generic model has higher robustness in handling various types of leaf images and has better classification capability for plant disease detection. The obtained results suggest the favorable use of the proposed model in a decision support system to identify diseases in several plant species for a large range of leaf images.",

Although disease symptoms can manifest in any part of the plant, only methods that explore visible symptoms in leaves and stems were considered. This was done for two main reasons: to limit the length of the paper and because methods dealing with roots, seeds and fruits have some peculiarities that would warrant a specific survey. The selected proposals are divided into three classes according to their objective: detection, severity quantification, and classification. Each of those classes, in turn, are subdivided according to the main technical solution used in the algorithm. This paper is expected to be useful to researchers working both on vegetable pathology and pattern recognition, providing a comprehensive and accessible overview of this important field of research.",

Plant diseases have been detected and classified using a variety of machine learning (ML) models in the past. Deep Learning (DL) appears to have great potential in terms of increased accuracy; however, in agricultural applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has widely been utilised by researchers. CNNs are so effective at identifying plant species, managing yields, detecting weeds, managing soil, and water, counting fruits, detecting diseases and pests, and evaluating plant nutrient status. A farmer can diagnose plant diseases quickly and accurately with an automated disease detection system. To speed up crop diagnosis, plant leaf disease detection systems must be automated. In this paper, we evaluated twelve different models on a new plant diseases dataset and demonstrated that the most accurate model was Densenet169. In training and validation, the accuracy was 97.2% and 97.8%, respectively.",

In this paper, a novel vegetable disease and insect pest recognition method is proposed based on the current computer vision and image processing methods. To investigate the vegetable disease and insect pest state, it is convenient to use images captured using smart phones for judgment. To implement this application, the disease area and the insect number on the leaves should be detected and figured out. So a new extraction and classification algorithm is firstly introduced to recognize leaves from images. Then a region-labeling algorithm is applied to calculate the insect number and disease areas in the segmented images. To deal with the areas of adhesion, a mathematical morphology algorithm is used for separating the objects. The proposed method is implemented on mobile smart devices and tested with field experiments. The experimental...",

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21:2% top-1 and 5:6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3:5% top-5 error and 17:3% top-1 error on the validation set and 3:6% top-5 error on the official test set.",

        "abstract": "The global rise in population has led to a shortage of raw materials and food supplies. The agricultural sector has become the primary and most vital source to overcome this particular constraint. However, the industry itself is facing the challenge of pests and various crop diseases. Battling this has been the significant focus of the sector for decades. Still, due to the technology gap that existed earlier, there existed a constraint on identifying the diseased crops on a massive scale. Nevertheless, today, with the improvement of technologies such as drones, IoT devices, and higher processing speeds combined with data analysis and machine learning, the problem of identification can be resolved quickly. This paper aims to provide a brief description of existing solutions that have been published and focuses on the more efficient machine learning model based on conventional neural networks (CNN) that we have developed. This machine learning model can be deployed on IoT devices, mobile phones, and drones and cameras that farmers can utilize to identify the diseased crops on a massive scale and take the necessary precautions not to let the disease spread and affect the supply produced. The proposed model using CNN was trained using images from plant village dataset and attained an accuracy of 94.87% in identifying the diseased plants with the help of image processing by OpenCV. Finally, the paper showcases the detailed analysis of the proposed scheme and results obtained by the model.",
