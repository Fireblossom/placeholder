Histidine, cysteine, proline, methionine, lysine and aromatic amino acids have demonstrated antioxidant activity by different mechanisms. As an example, in peptides (3–16 amino acids) from soy proteins, the histidine – and particularly the imidazole group position – were identified as important for the hydrogen-donating, peroxyl radical scavenging and/or the metal chelation activities (Chen, Muramoto, Yamauchi, & Nokihara, 1996). Antioxidant activity of these peptides was enhanced by the presence of hydrophobic amino acids (proline and leucine) in the N-terminus. Chen, Muramoto, Yamauchi, and Nokihara (1998) have postulated that hydrophobic amino acids can increase the accessibility of the antioxidant peptides to hydrophobic cellular targets such as the polyunsaturated chain of fatty acids of biological membranes. Aromatic amino acids tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophane can donate protons to free radicals and contribute to the chelating of pro-oxidant metal ions. The SH group of cysteine can also scavenge free radicals.
