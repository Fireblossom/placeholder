In addition, the C-terminal of three peptides has amino acid Trp. Amino acid met also has ACE inhibitory activity (Muguruma et  al. 2009). Wheat germ protein is a suitable source for the production of bioactive peptides responsible for the inhibition of Ca2+-contraction signaling pathways. In previous reports, wheat germ hydrolysate, with high protein content (>30%), evoked antioxidant and anti-hypertensive effects (Zhu, Zhou, and Qian 2006b).
