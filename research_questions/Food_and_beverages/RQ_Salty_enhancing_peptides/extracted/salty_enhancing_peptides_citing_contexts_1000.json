        "title": "Taste-Active Peptides from Triple-Enzymatically Hydrolyzed Straw Mushroom Proteins Enhance Salty Taste: An Elucidation of Their Effect on the T1R1/T1R3 Taste Receptor via Molecular Docking",
        "abstract": "The objective of our study was to analyze and identify enzymatic peptides from straw mushrooms that can enhance salty taste with the aim of developing saltiness enhancement peptides to reduce salt intake and promote dietary health. We isolated taste-related peptides from the straw mushroom extract using ultrafiltration and identified them using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The study found that the ultrafiltration fraction (500–2000 Da) of straw mushroom peptides had a saltiness enhancement effect, as revealed via subsequent E-tongue and sensory analyses. The ultrafiltration fractions (500–2000 Da) were found to contain 220 peptides, which were identified through UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. The interaction of these peptides with the T1R1/T1R3 receptor was also assessed. The investigation highlighted the significant involvement of Asp223, Gln243, Leu232, Asp251, and Pro254 in binding peptides from triple-enzymatically hydrolyzed straw mushrooms to T1R1/T1R3. Based on the binding energy and active site analysis, three peptides were selected for synthesis: DFNALPFK (−9.2 kcal/mol), YNEDNGIVK (−8.8 kcal/mol), and VPGGQEIKDR (−8.9 kcal/mol). Importantly, 3.2 mmol of VPGGQEIKDR increased the saltiness level of a 0.05% NaCl solution to that of a 0.15% NaCl solution. Additionally, the addition of 0.8 mmol of YNEDNGIVK to a 0.05% NaCl solution resulted in the same level of saltiness as a 0.1% NaCl solution.",

            "title": "Molecular dynamics: survey of methods for simulating the activity of proteins.",
            "abstract": "The term molecular mechanics (MM) refers to the use of simple potential-energy functions (e.g., harmonic oscillator or Coulombic potentials) to model molecular systems. Molecular mechanics approaches are widely applied in molecular structure refinement, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, and ligand-docking simulations. \n \nTypically, molecular mechanics models consist of spherical atoms connected by springs which represent bonds. Internal forces experienced in the model structure are described using simple mathematical functions. For example, Hooke’s law is commonly used to describe bonded interactions, and the nonbonded atoms might be treated as inelastic hard spheres or may interact according to a Lennard-Jones potential. Using these simple models, a molecular dynamics simulation numerically solves Newton’s equations of motion, thus allowing structural fluctuations to be observed with respect to time. \n \nDynamic simulation methods are widely used to obtain information on the time evolution of conformations of proteins and other biological macromolecules1–4 and also kinetic and thermodynamic information. Simulations can provide fine detail concerning the motions of individual particles as a function of time. They can be utilized to quantify the properties of a system at a precision and on a time scale that is otherwise inaccessible, and simulation is, therefore, a valuable tool in extending our understanding of model systems. Theoretical consideration of a system additionally allows one to investigate the specific contributions to a property through “computational alchemy”,5 that is, modifying the simulation in a way that is nonphysical but nonetheless allows a model’s characteristics to be probed. One particular example is the artificial conversion of the energy function from that representing one system to that of another during a simulation. This is an important technique in free-energy calculations.6 Thus, molecular dynamics simulations, along with a range of complementary computational approaches, have become valuable tools for investigating the basis of protein structure and function. \n \nThis review offers an outline of the origin of molecular dynamics simulation for protein systems and how it has developed into a robust and trusted tool. This review then covers more recent advances in theory and an illustrative selection of practical studies in which it played a central role. The range of studies in which MD has played a considerable or pivotal role is immense, and this review cannot do justice to them; MD simulations of biomedical importance were recently reviewed.4 Particular emphasis will be placed on the study of dynamic aspects of protein recognition, an area where molecular dynamics has scope to provide broad and far-ranging insights. This review concludes with a brief discussion of the future potential offered to advancement of the biological and biochemical sciences and the remaining issues that must be overcome to allow the full extent of this potential to be realized. \n \n1.1. Historical Background \nMD methods were originally conceived within the theoretical physics community during the 1950s. In 1957, Alder and Wainwright7 performed the earliest MD simulation using the so-called hard-sphere model, in which the atoms interacted only through perfect collisions. Rahman8 subsequently applied a smooth, continuous potential to mimic real atomic interactions. During the 1970s, as computers became more widespread, MD simulations were developed for more complex systems, culminating in 1976 with the first simulation of a protein9,10 using an empirical energy function constructed using physics-based first-principles assumptions. MD simulations are now widely and routinely applied and especially popular in the fields of materials science11,12 and biophysics. \n \nAs will be discussed later in this review, a variety of experimental conditions may be simulated with modern theories and algorithms. The initial simulations only considered single molecules in vacuo. Over time, more realistic or at least biologically relevant simulations could be performed. This trend is continuing today. \n \nThe initial protein MD simulation, of the small bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), covered only 9.2 ps of simulation time. Modern simulations routinely have so-called equilibration periods much longer than that, and production simulations of tens of nanoseconds are routine, with the first microsecond MD simulation being reported in 1998.13 In addition, the original BPTI simulation included only about 500 atoms rather than the 104-106 atoms that are common today. While much of this advancement results from an immense increase in availability of computing power, major theoretical and methodological developments also contribute significantly. \n \nThe number of publications regarding MD theory and application of MD to biological systems is growing at an extraordinary pace. A single review cannot do justice to the recent applications of MD. Using data from ISI Web of Science, the authors estimate that during 2005 at least 800 articles will be published that discuss molecular dynamics and proteins. The historical counts are shown in Figure 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOpen in a separate window \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \n \nArticles matching ISI Web of Science query “TS=(protein) AND TS=(molecular dynamics)”.",

Sensory evaluation revealed that glutamic acid, serine, proline, arginine, lysine, adenosine 5'-monophosphate, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), succinic acid, sodium, potassium, phosphates, and chlorides were the core taste-active contributors to T. obscurus. Besides glutamic acid, IMP, succinic acid, and potassium, the characteristic T. obscurus-like umami and kokumi profiles were induced by adding flavor peptides, among which Pro-Val-Ala-Arg-Met-Cys-Arg and Tyr-Gly-Gly-Thr-Pro-Pro-Phe-Val were identified as key substances on the basis of the addition test and dose-response analysis. The present data may help to reveal the secret of the delicious taste of T. obscurus and provide the basis for the development of deeper flavor analysis of pufferfish.",

Consumers’ (N = 330, recruited from college campus) liking, emotions, perceived saltiness and bitterness intensity, satisfaction and purchase intent (PI) of peanuts were measured following a balanced incomplete block design (t = 10, k = 3, r = 9, b = 30, λ = 2, e₂ = 0.74). Emotions and PI were evaluated both before and after presenting a low‐sodium health benefit message. Sodium content of peanuts was reduced from 140 mg Na/50 g peanuts to 41.67 mg Na/50 g without significantly affecting liking scores and with positive PI over 60%. In general, high bitterness and low saltiness intensity ratings negatively affected liking and satisfaction. Consumers expressed less satisfaction when perceived saltiness intensity was ‘Not Enough’ than when ‘Too Much.’ Based on optimisation analysis, any formulation within the range of 59‐100/0‐40/0‐12.5% NaCl/KCl/Gly‐ representing a potential 37% sodium reduction past minimum ‘low sodium’ requirements‐ will yield an acceptable product.",

The linear fit was performed to unravel the concentration–response values correlations of eight flavor enhancers. The electronic tongue response data were then analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant factor analysis (DFA) method. It was found that the umami response value of the electronic tongue and the flavor enhancer concentration showed a semi‐logarithmic function. Moreover, the PCA and DFA could successfully distinguish the variety and concentration of flavor enhancer. The umami intensities were also assessed by human sensory and showed consistency with those of electronic tongue tests. This implies the electronic tongue has a great potential as an alternative for biological tongue on sensing intensity of flavor enhancer.",

Collagen glycopeptides were obtained by Flavourzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis, followed by transglutaminase-induced glycosylation. The salt taste-enhancing effects of collagen glycopeptides were evaluated by sensory evaluation and an electronic tongue. LC-MS/MS and molecular docking technologies were employed to investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for the salt taste-enhancing effect. The optimal conditions were 5 h for enzymatic hydrolysis, 3 h for enzymatic glycosylation, and 1.0% (E/S, w/w) for transglutaminase. The grafting degree of collagen glycopeptides was 26.9 mg/g, and the salt taste-enhancing rate was 59.0%. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that Gln was the glycosylation modification site. Molecular docking confirmed that collagen glycopeptides can bind to salt taste receptors epithelial sodium channel protein and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction. Overall, collagen glycopeptides have a significant salt taste-enhancing effect, which contributes to the application of collagen glycopeptides for salt reduction without compromising taste in the food industry.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms underlying gustatory detection of dietary sodium is important for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Here, we show that Angiotensin II (AngII), a major mediator of body fluid and sodium homeostasis, modulates salty and sweet taste sensitivities, and that this modulation critically influences ingestive behaviors in mice. Gustatory nerve recording demonstrated that AngII suppressed amiloride-sensitive taste responses to NaCl. Surprisingly, AngII also enhanced nerve responses to sweeteners, but had no effect on responses to KCl, sour, bitter, or umami tastants. These effects of AngII on nerve responses were blocked by the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist CV11974. In behavioral tests, CV11974 treatment reduced the stimulated high licking rate to NaCl and sweeteners in water-restricted mice with elevated plasma AngII levels. In taste cells AT1 proteins were coexpressed with αENaC (epithelial sodium channel α-subunit, an amiloride-sensitive salt taste receptor) or T1r3 (a sweet taste receptor component). These results suggest that the taste organ is a peripheral target of AngII. The specific reduction of amiloride-sensitive salt taste sensitivity by AngII may contribute to increased sodium intake. Furthermore, AngII may contribute to increased energy intake by enhancing sweet responses. The linkage between salty and sweet preferences via AngII signaling may optimize sodium and calorie intakes.",

Although the detrimental effects of high salt on the skeleton have been reported, longitudinal assessment of calcium balance together with changes in bone microarchitecture and strength under salt loading has not been fully demonstrated. To address these unanswered issues, male Sprague–Dawley rats were fed normal salt diet (NSD; 0.8% NaCl) or high salt diet (HSD; 8% NaCl) for 5 months. Elevation of blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy and glomerular deterioration were observed in HSD, thus validating the model. The balance studies were performed to monitor calcium input and output upon HSD challenge. The HSD-induced increase in calcium losses in urine and feces together with reduced fractional calcium absorption led to a decrease in calcium retention. With these calcium imbalances, we therefore examined microstructural changes of long bones of the hind limbs. Using the synchrotron radiation x-ray tomographic microscopy, we showed that trabecular structure of tibia and femur of HSD displayed a marked increase in porosity. Consistently, the volumetric micro-computed tomography also demonstrated a significant decrease in trabecular bone mineral density with expansion of endosteal perimeter in the tibia. Interestingly, bone histomorphometric analyses indicated that salt loading caused an increase in osteoclast number together with decreases in osteoblast number and osteoid volume. This uncoupling process of bone remodeling in HSD might underlie an accelerated bone loss and bone structural changes. In conclusion, long-term excessive salt consumption leads to impairment of skeletal mass and integrity possibly through negative calcium balance.",

In the early 2000s, research into taste reception was greatly developed with discovery of the receptors. However, the mechanism of salt taste reception is not fully elucidated yet and many questions still remain. At present, next-generation sequencing and genome-editing technologies are available which would become pivotal tools to elucidate the remaining issues. Here we review current mechanisms of salt taste reception in particular and characterize the properties of transmembrane channel-like 4 as a novel salt taste-related molecule that we found using these sophisticated tools.",

Compared with CYE, in a thermally treated autolysate prepared under laboratory conditions from baker's yeast (SPYA) several odorants, e.g., methional, 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline, 3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethyl-2(5H)-furanone (Sotolon), phenylacetic acid, and 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine, showed higher flavor dilution (FD) factors, whereas the reverse was found for 2-furanmethanethiol (FMT). The amounts of its precursor amino acid cysteine in the CYE and the SPYA were well correlated with the different odor activities of the FMT in both solutions.

        "abstract": "Abstract Condiments (such as sodium chloride and glutamate sodium) cause consumers to ingest too much sodium and may lead to a variety of diseases, thus decreasing their quality of life. Recently, a salt reduction strategy using flavor peptides has been established. However, the development of this strategy has not been well adopted by the food industry. There is an acute need to screen for peptides with salty and umami taste, and to understand their taste characteristic and taste mechanism. This review provides a thorough analysis of the literature on flavor peptides with sodium-reducing ability, involving their preparation, taste characteristic, taste mechanism and applications in the food industry. Flavor peptides come from a wide range of sources and can be sourced abundantly from natural foods. Flavor peptides with salty and umami tastes are mainly composed of umami amino acids. Differences in amino acid sequences, spatial structures and food matrices will cause different tastes in flavor peptides, mostly attributed to the interaction between peptides and taste receptors. In addition to being used in condiments, flavor peptides have also anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant abilities, offering the potential to be used as functional ingredients, thus making their future in the food industry extremely promising.",

In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a non-selective detector for a wide range of salts. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities—sweet, sour, bitter and umami—are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCα in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice.",

PFP-LC-MS/MS and HILIC-MS/MS confirmed that l-arginyl dipeptides were liberated when casein or lysozyme served as substrate. Much higher yields of dipeptides (42-75 μmol/g substrate) were released from lysozyme than from casein. The lysozyme hydrolysate generated by the complex set of peptidases of Trametes versicolor showed the highest l-arginyl dipeptide yields and a significant salt taste enhancing effect in a model cheese matrix and in a curd cheese. With a broad spectrum of novel specific and nonspecific peptidases active in the slightly acidic pH range, T. versicolor might be a suitable enzyme source for low-salt dairy products.",

Because excess sodium intake is associated with many health problems, it could be useful to have salt taste enhancers that are not sodium based.

AR, RA, and RP significantly increased the number of cell responses to NaCl, whereas no effect was observed with RE, ER, DD, or ED. We also found no effects with alanine, arginine, or a mixture of both amino acids. Pharmacological studies showed that AR significantly increased responses of amiloride-sensitive but not amiloride-insensitive cells. In studies using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), responses to AR were significantly decreased in cells transfected with siRNAs against epithelial sodium channel ENaCα or ENaCδ compared to untransfected cells. AR dramatically increased NaCl-elicited responses in cells transfected with NHE1 siRNA but not in those transfected with ENaCα or ENaCδ siRNAs.

Paradoxically, the pH of weak acidic stimuli correlates poorly with the perception of their sourness. A fundamental issue surrounding sour taste reception is the identity of the sour stimulus. We tested the hypothesis that acids induce sour taste perception by penetrating plasma membranes as H(+) ions or as undissociated molecules and decreasing the intracellular pH (pH(i)) of TRCs. Our data suggest that taste nerve responses to weak acids (acetic acid and CO(2)) are independent of stimulus pH but strongly correlate with the intracellular acidification of polarized TRCs. Taste nerve responses to CO(2) were voltage sensitive and were blocked with MK-417, a specific blocker of carbonic anhydrase. Strong acids (HCl) decrease pH(i) in a subset of TRCs that contain a pathway for H(+) entry. Both the apical membrane and the paracellular shunt pathway restrict H(+) entry such that a large decrease in apical pH is translated into a relatively small change in TRC pH(i) within the physiological range. We conclude that a decrease in TRC pH(i) is the proximate stimulus in rat sour taste transduction.",

In this paper, quillaja saponin (QS) based hollow salt particles (∼10 μm) were fabricated by simple spray drying, and utilized as solid carriers to enhance sensory aromas with reduced sodium intake. QS-coated nanodroplets were firstly prepared as a reservoir for flavor oils (lemon and garlic oil), and then served as frameworks to construct hollow salt particles via general spray drying. Headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (DHS-GC-MS) and panel sensory analysis conclude that the hollow salt particles loaded with flavor oils enhance typical aroma attributes and saltiness perception in comparison with their mixture control. The QS-based hollow salt particles could be developed into novel vehicles for improving flavor performance with reduced sodium intake, and furthermore used for delivery of hydrophobic bioactives in food systems.",

Gel permeation chromatography and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography/comparative taste dilution analysis (HILIC/cTDA), followed by LC-MS/MS and 1D/2D-NMR experiments, led to the identification of gamma-L-glutamyl-L-leucine, gamma-L-glutamyl-L-valine, and gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-beta-alanine as key molecules inducing this taste-modifying effect. Sensory analysis of aqueous solutions of these peptides showed threshold concentrations between 3.3 and 9.4 mmol/L for an unspecific, slightly astringent sensation. More interestingly, when added to a savory matrix such as sodium chloride and monosodium glutamate solutions or chicken broth, the detection thresholds of these gamma-glutamyl peptides decreased significantly and remarkably enhanced mouthfulness, complexity, and long-lastingness of the savory taste were observed; for example, the threshold of gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-beta-alanine decreased by a factor of 32 in a binary mixture of glutamic acid and sodium chloride. As tasteless molecules inducing mouthfulness, thickness, and increasing continuity of savory foods were coined about 10 years ago as \"kokumi\" flavor compounds, the peptides identified in raw as well as thermally treated beans have to be considered as kokumi compounds.",

This study aims to assess the ability of the electronic tongue system on the umami taste from sous-vide beef semitendinosus. The identification was based on the taste-enhancing synergism between umami compounds 5’-nucleotides (IMP, GMP, AMP, inosine, and hypoxanthine) and free amino acids (glutamic and aspartic acid) using the estimation of equivalent umami concentration (EUC) and electronic tongue system. Sous-vide cooked at 60 and 70 °C for 6 and 12 h and cooked using the conventional method at 70 °C for 30 min (as control) were compared. The temperature had a significant effect on 5’-nucleotides, but aspartic and glutamic acid were not influenced by any treatments applied. Sous-vide cooked at 60 °C tended to have higher inosine and hypoxanthine. Meanwhile, desirable 5’-nucleotides IMP, AMP, and GMP were more intensified at the temperature of 70 °C. The principal component analysis predicted a good correlation between EUC and the electronic tongue, with sous-vide at 70 °C for 12 h presenting the most umami. Therefore, the electronic tongue system is a useful tool in food processing, particularly in determining complex sensory properties such as umami, which cannot be evaluated objectively.",

            "abstract": "Renovascular hypertension is characterized by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, blunted natriuretic responses, and elevated sympathetic nerve activity. Excess dietary salt intake exaggerates arterial blood pressure (ABP) in multiple models of experimental hypertension. The present study tested whether a high-salt diet exaggerated ABP and vascular dysfunction in a 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) murine model. Male C57BL/6J mice (8–12 wk) were randomly assigned, and fed a 0.1% or 4.0% NaCl diet, and instrumented with telemetry units to measure ABP. Then, the 2K1C model was produced by placing a cuff around the right renal artery. Systolic, diastolic, and mean ABP were significantly higher in mice fed 4.0% vs. 0.1% NaCl at 1 wk but not after 3 wk. Interestingly, 2K1C hypertension progressively increased arterial pulse pressure in both groups; however, the magnitude was significantly greater in mice fed 4.0% vs. 0.1% NaCl at 3 wk. Moreover, pulse wave velocity was significantly greater in 2K1C mice fed 4.0% vs. 0.1% NaCl diet or sham-operated mice fed either diet. Histological assessment of aortas indicated no structural differences among groups. Finally, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly and selectively attenuated in the aorta but not mesenteric arteries of 2K1C mice fed 4.0% NaCl vs. 0.1% NaCl or sham-operated control mice. The findings suggest that dietary salt loading transiently exaggerates 2K1C renovascular hypertension but promotes chronic aortic stiffness and selective aortic vascular dysfunction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY High dietary salt exaggerates hypertension in multiple experimental models. Here we demonstrate that a high-salt diet produces a greater increase in arterial blood pressure at 1 wk after induction of 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) hypertension but not at 3 wk. Interestingly, 2K1C mice fed a high-salt diet displayed an exaggerated pulse pressure, elevated pulse wave velocity, and reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the aorta but not mesenteric arteries. These findings suggest that dietary salt may interact with underlying cardiovascular disease to promote selective vascular dysfunction and aortic stiffness.",

The optimal conditions for UHP enzymatic hydrolysis were as follows: pressure time was 60 min, pH value was 7.5, and pressure was 150 MPa. The content of soluble peptide, total-free amino acid, and delicious amino acid (DAA) content of atmospheric pressure and UHP hydrolysates were 11.37 vs 16.70 mg/mL, 5 528 vs 6 234 mg/100 g, and 2145 vs 2411 mg/100 g, respectively. The major compounds in the enzymatic hydrolysates of UHP included seven types of ketones (18.31%), 8 types of aldehydes (6.35%), 3 types of alcohols (2.61%), one type of ester (0.38%), and one type of furan (7.89%). The results of electronic tongue (e-tongue) demonstrated good agreement with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In conclusion, UHP enzymatic hydrolysis can be a potential tool to improve the flavor compounds of hydrolysates.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of γ-EV in modulating the TNF-α induced inflammatory responses in endothelial cells via CaSR mediated pathways. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAoECs) were pre-treated (2 h) with γ-EV (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mM). 1 mM pre-treatment of γ-EV significantly reduced the upregulation of inflammatory adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin, by 44.56% and 57.41% respectively. Cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, production was significantly reduced by 40% and 51%, respectively with 1 mM pre-treatment of γ-EV. Similarly, there was a significant reduction in chemokine MCP-1 from a positive control of 9.70 ± 0.52 ng/mL to 6.6 ± 0.43 ng/mL, after γ-EV treatment. The anti-inflammatory effect of γ-EV was attenuated by the treatment of CaSR specific inhibitor, NPS-2143, suggesting the involvement of CaSR mediated pathways. Further studies identified the critical role of key modulators, such as β-arrestin2 and CREB, in mediating the CaSR-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of γ-EV. Lastly, the transport efficiency of γ-EV was evaluated through the monolayer of intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) and the apparent permeability (Papp) of the peptide was found to be 1.56x10-6 cm/sec.",

Ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were used to isolate the umami peptides of sunflower seed. Five fractions were obtained after ultra-filtration, fraction with molecular weight 1-3 kDa showed highest umami intensity value 13.93 ± 0.06. Fraction F1, which was purified via sephadex gel filtration chromatography, exhibited high umami value (12.21 ± 0.06), and low bitterness (4.57 ± 0.06). Seven sub-fractions were purified by RP-HPLC, and the umami taste value of F1-4 was the highest (14.16 ± 0.05), which was 1.32 times stronger than that of sunflower seed protein hydrolysates without any purification. Furthermore, the structure of fraction F1-4 was characterized by mass spectrometry, and three peptide fractions were identified, with amino acid sequences of DVNNPANQLD, NNENQLDEYQR, and EFEGGSIEH, respectively.",

It is most commonly known as a flavouring enhancer in food processing, which provides umami taste that intensifies the meaty, savory flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups. The amino acid glutamic acid it is naturally presents in food. Globally, commercial MSG’s consumption is increasing, markable high in Asia. Likewise, its production has known improvements regarding both method and technical equipment. Although MSG’s safety was evaluated by international organizations (EFSA, FDA) as safe and the limits were set up, there are studies concern about its side effects such as obesity, asthma, migraine headache, etc. The European Union classifies it as a food additive permitted in certain foods and subject to quantitative limits. The increase in commercially MSG use has raised the concern of both scientists and consumers about its safety. Therefore, due to a need of full comprehension about MSG, it is necessary to give more attention in studying it. Advantage in the development of analysis methods and technical equipments should be exploited to obtain higher accuracy result. This review provides a brief and general information about MSG with updates in its research.",

The presence of an epithelial cation channel that receives Na+ has previously been reported. However, no molecular entity involving Cl− receptors has been elucidated. We report the strong expression of transmembrane channel-like 4 (TMC4) in the circumvallate and foliate papillae projected to the glossopharyngeal nerve, mediating a high-concentration of NaCl. Electrophysiological analysis using HEK293T cells revealed that TMC4 was a voltage-dependent Cl− channel and the consequent currents were completely inhibited by NPPB, an anion channel blocker. TMC4 allowed permeation of organic anions including gluconate, but their current amplitudes at positive potentials were less than that of Cl−. Tmc4-deficient mice showed significantly weaker glossopharyngeal nerve response to high-concentration of NaCl than the wild-type littermates. These results indicated that TMC4 is a novel chloride channel that responds to high-concentration of NaCl.",

In the present study, targeted quantitation of literature-known taste compounds, calculation of dose-over-threshold factors, and taste re-engineering experiments enabled the identification of 34 key tastants. Following the sensoproteomics approach, 14 umami-, kokumi-, and salt-enhancing peptides were identified for the first time, with intrinsic taste threshold concentrations in the range of 166-939 μmol/L and taste-modulating threshold concentrations ranging from 42 to 420 μmol/L. The lowest taste-modulating threshold concentrations were found for the leucyl peptide LDYY with an umami- and salt-enhancing threshold of 42 μmol/L. Addition of the 14 newly identified peptides to the taste recombinate (aRecDipeptides) increased the overall taste intensity and mouthfulness of the recombinate, and comparison with the authentic soy sauce confirmed the identification of all key tastants. Finally, these data as well as the quantitative profiling of several (non)-fermented foods highlight the importance of fermentation with respect to taste formation. On the basis of this knowledge, microorganisms with specific digestion patterns may be used to tailor the taste profile and especially the salt taste sensation of soy sauces.",

            "The inhibitory effect of amiloride on sodium taste has long been interpreted as the evidence that amiloride sensitive ENaCs play a crucial role in salt taste (Heck, Mierson, and DeSimone 1984; Oka et al. 2013; Roper and Chaudhari 2017).",
            "However, amiloride has not shown to alter the salty taste perception in humans, which means there is no evidence that ENaCs are the main salty taste receptors in human beings (Xu et al. 2017).",
            "In another research, the enhancing effect of kokumi peptides (glutathione and γ-glutamyl-valyl-glycine) on salt perception was further studied and results showed that the enhancing effect of these substances was not mediated by ENaC (Bigiani and Rhyu 2023).",

However, there is an increasing interest in reducing the sodium content in foodstuffs, owing to health-related concerns related to its overconsumption. Therefore, the possible use of enzymatically hydrolyzed anchovy protein (eHAP) in enhancing the intensity of the salty taste in model broth was investigated in this study. The sodium chloride content of eHAP was 67.7 g/L. The lightness (L) and yellowness (b) of the model broth increased with increasing eHAP concentration. Additionally, the perceived intensity of the salty taste of eHAP solutions increased with increasing amounts of eHAP at a given NaCl concentration in the model broth. The intensity of the salty taste was enhanced by 0.37-35.58% as eHAP was added. The results suggest that it may be possible to reduce the sodium chloride content in foods by enhancing the salty taste with eHAP.",

Effects of dietary sodium intake on HRV of normotensive persons have not, however, been investigated to date. The present study examined effects of low and high sodium diets on blood pressure, heart rate, and HRV in 36 healthy, normotensive women, ages 40-70. Each was placed on a low sodium diet for 6 days followed by a high sodium diet for 6 days. The high salt diet increased mean systolic blood pressure, decreased heart rate, and increased high frequency HRV (HF). Cardiac vagal tone, estimated at baseline from heart period and a time domain estimate of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, was higher in salt-sensitive than salt-insensitive subjects. The finding of increased vagal tone in normotensive persons on high salt intake indicates that dietary sodium status should be considered in behavioral studies of HRV.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT A high-salt diet poses potential risks to human health. The current use of sodium substitutes in the food industry often results in a reduction in the organoleptic quality of food. γ-Glutamyl peptides are small-molecule peptides containing γ-glutamyl residues, which significantly contribute to the kokumi taste in foods. These peptides exhibit a synergistic effect when consumed with sodium salt, thereby enhancing the perception of saltiness and aiding in the prevention of various cardiovascular diseases associated with excessive salt intake. γ-Glutamyl peptides have garnered considerable attention from researchers for their role in eliciting kokumi taste and inducing various biological activities through the activation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). This paper provides a comprehensive review of dietary sources, efficient preparations, taste-enhancing properties, taste evaluation methods, and potential biological activities of γ-glutamyl peptides. The study aims to explore the efficient application of γ-glutamyl peptides in the food industry. Additionally, it offers a theoretical foundation and reference for the in-depth study of “salt reduction without reducing saltiness”, and the development of related functional products.",

            "abstract": "Modulation of the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is one of the physiological activities of γ-glutamyl peptides such as glutathione (γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine). γ-Glutamyl peptides also possess a flavoring effect, i.e., sensory activity of kokumi substances, which modifies the five basic tastes when added to food. These activities have been shown to be positively correlated, suggesting that kokumi γ-glutamyl peptides are perceived through CaSRs in humans. Our research is based on the hypothesis that the discovery of highly active CaSR agonist peptides will lead to the creation of practical kokumi peptides. Through continuous study of the structure-CaSR-activity relation of a large number of γ-glutamyl peptides, we have determined that the structural requirements for intense CaSR activity of γ-glutamyl peptides are as follows: existence of an N-terminal γ-L-glutamyl residue; existence of a moderately sized, aliphatic, neutral substituent at the second residue in an L-configuration; and existence of a C-terminal carboxylic acid, preferably with the existence of glycine as the third constituent. By the sensory analysis of γ-glutamyl peptides selected by screening using the CaSR activity assay, γ-glutamylvalylglycine was found to be a potent kokumi peptide. Furthermore, norvaline-containing γ-glutamyl peptides, i.e., γ-glutamylnorvalylglycine and γ-glutamylnorvaline, possessed excellent sensory activity of kokumi substances. A novel, practical industrial synthesis of regiospecific γ-glutamyl peptides is also required for their commercialization, which was achieved through the ring opening reaction of N-α-carbobenzoxy-L-glutamic anhydride and amino acids or peptides in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide.",

The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor is the best-known G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) able to sense external Ca2+ changes. Widely recognized as a fundamental player in systemic Ca2+ homeostasis, the CaR is ubiquitously expressed in the human body where it activates multiple signalling pathways. In this review, old and new notions regarding the mechanisms by which extracellular Ca2+ microdomains are created and the tools available to measure them are analyzed. After a survey of the main signalling pathways triggered by the CaR, a special attention is reserved for the emerging concepts regarding CaR function in the heart, CaR trafficking and pharmacology. Finally, an overview on other Ca2+ sensors is provided.",

            "abstract": "Some foods are known to have flavours that cannot be explained by the five basic tastes alone, such as continuity, mouthfulness and thick flavour. It was demonstrated that these sensations are evoked by the addition of kokumi substances, flavour modifiers that have no taste themselves. However, their mode of action has been poorly understood. During a study on the perception of amino acids and peptides, it was found that glutathione (GSH) was one of the agonists of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). We have hypothesized that CaSR is involved in the perception of kokumi substances. We found that all CaSR agonists tested act as kokumi substances and that a positive correlation exists between the CaSR activity of γ-glutamyl peptides and kokumi intensity. Furthermore, the kokumi intensities of GSH and γ-Glu-Val-Gly, a potent kokumi peptide, were significantly reduced by the CaSR-specific antagonist, NPS-2143. These results suggest that CaSR is involved in the perception of kokumi substances. A potent kokumi peptide, γ-Glu-Val-Gly, enhanced sweetness, saltiness and umami when added to 3.3% sucrose, 0.9% NaCl and 0.5% MSG solutions, respectively. In addition, γ-Glu-Val-Gly enhanced the intensity of continuity, mouthfulness and thick flavour when added to chicken soup and reduced-fat cream. These results suggest that γ-Glu-Val-Gly is a potent kokumi peptide and would be useful for improving the flavour of food.",

Proteolysis was an important factor for generation of γ-glutamyl dipeptides. Sourdoughs fermented with four strains of L. reuteri had different concentrations of γ-Glu-Glu, γ-Glu-Leu, and γ-Glu-Met, indicating strain-specific differences in enzyme activity. Buffer fermentations with L. reuteri confirmed the ability of the strains to convert amino acids to γ-glutamyl dipeptides as well as the strain-specific differences. Sensory evaluation of bread revealed that sourdough bread with higher concentrations of γ-glutamyl dipeptides ranked higher with respect to the taste intensity when compared to regular bread and type I sourdough bread. Sourdough breads fermented with L. reuteri LTH5448 and L. reuteri 100-23 differed with respect to the intensity of the salty taste; this difference corresponded to a different concentration of γ-glutamyl dipeptides. These results suggest a strain-specific contribution of γ-glutamyl dipeptides to the taste of bread. The use of sourdough fermented with glutamate and kokumi peptide accumulating lactobacilli improved the taste of bread without adverse effect on other taste or quality attributes.",

            "abstract": "γ-Glutamyl peptides were identified previously as novel positive allosteric modulators of Ca(2+)(o)-dependent intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in HEK-293 cells that bind in the calcium-sensing receptor VFT domain. In the current study, we investigated whether γ-glutamyl-tripeptides including γ-Glu-Cys-Gly (glutathione) and its analogs S-methylglutathione and S-propylglutathione, or dipeptides including γ-Glu-Ala and γ-Glu-Cys are positive allosteric modulators of Ca(2+)(o)-dependent Ca(2+)(i) mobilization and PTH secretion from normal human parathyroid cells as well as Ca(2+)(o)-dependent suppression of intracellular cAMP levels in calcium-sensing receptor (CaR)-expressing HEK-293 cells. In addition, we compared the effects of the potent γ-glutamyl peptide S-methylglutathione, and the amino acid L-Phe on HEK-293 cells that stably expressed either the wild-type CaR or the double mutant T145A/S170T, which exhibits selectively impaired responses to L-amino acids. We find that γ-glutamyl peptides are potent positive allosteric modulators of the CaR that promote Ca(2+)(o)-dependent Ca(2+)(i) mobilization, suppress intracellular cAMP levels and inhibit PTH secretion from normal human parathyroid cells. Furthermore, we find that the double mutant T145A/S170T exhibits markedly impaired Ca(2+)(i) mobilization and cAMP suppression responses to S-methylglutathione as well as L-Phe indicating that γ-glutamyl peptides and L-amino acids activate the CaR via a common mechanism.",

The measurement of a point of subjective equality (PSE) showed that the peptide increases the flavor characteristics but did not affect the intensity of basic tastes, such as sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and umami. However, the threshold value of GSH decreased significantly in an umami solution containing 0.05% each of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and disodium inosinate (IMP). This suggests that GSH interacts with the umami substance and has a certain effect on the flavor. GSH had a characteristic kokumi flavor, such as continuity, mouthfulness, and thickness in the umami solution as well as in a model beef extract constructed from analyzed components at a concentration of 0.02% w/v. Some foodstuffs, including meat, were found to contain GSH above its threshold value, which implicates the contribution of GSH to the flavor. The thermal degradation study suggested that a part of GSH have changed into its disulfide, pyroglutamic acid (PCA), and cyclocysteinylglycine in cooked foodstuffs.",

Renewal of taste receptor cells from actively dividing progenitors is finely tuned to maintain taste sensitivity throughout life. We show that conditional β-catenin deletion in mouse taste progenitors leads to rapid depletion of progenitors and Shh+ precursors, which in turn causes taste bud loss, followed by loss of gustatory nerve fibers. In addition, our data suggest LEF1, TCF7 and Wnt3 are involved in a Wnt pathway regulatory feedback loop that controls taste cell renewal in the circumvallate papilla epithelium. Unexpectedly, taste bud decline is greater in the anterior tongue and palate than in the posterior tongue. Mutant mice with this regional pattern of taste bud loss were unable to discern sweet at any concentration, but could distinguish bitter stimuli, albeit with reduced sensitivity. Our findings are consistent with published reports wherein anterior taste buds have higher sweet sensitivity while posterior taste buds are better tuned to bitter, and suggest β-catenin plays a greater role in renewal of anterior versus posterior taste buds.",

Further Chromatographic studies of the fraction showed that the key compounds were sulfur-containing components, such as alliin, (+)-S-methyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide, and γ-l-glutamyl-S-allyl-l-cysteine.",

            "abstract": "The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein receptor, is well recognized for its role in the regulation of adipocyte proliferation, in modulating adipose tissue dysfunction, and as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In the present study, we investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of γ-glutamylvaline (γ-EV) on mouse adipocytes and explore the role of γ-EV-activated CaSR in the regulation of cellular homeostasis using the mouse 3T3-L1 cell line in vitro model. Our results indicate that the 3T3-L1 adipocyte-like cells accumulated lipids and expressed CaSR after 2 days of differentiation and 7 days of maturation period. The pretreatment with γ-EV (10 μM) suppressed the production of TNF-α-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-6 (23.92 ± 5.45 ng/mL, p < 0.05)) and MCP-1 (101.17 ± 39.93 ng/mL, p < 0.05), while enhancing the expression of PPARγ (1.249 ± 0.109, p < 0.001) and adiponectin (7.37 ± 0.59 ng/mL, p < 0.05). Elevated expression of Wnt5a was detected in γ-EV-treated cells (115.90 ± 45.50, p < 0.001), suggesting the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Also, phosphorylation of β-catenin was shown to be significantly inhibited (0.442 ± 0.034) by TNF-α but restored when cells were pretreated with γ-EV (0.765 ± 0.048, p < 0.05). These findings suggest that γ-EV-induced CaSR activation not only prevents TNF-α-induced inflammation in adipocytes but also modulates the cross-talk between Wnt and PPARγ pathways. Concentrations of serine phosphorylated IRS-1 were shown to be lower in γ-EV-treated cells, indicating γ-EV may also prevent inflammation in the context of insulin resistance. Thus, γ-EV-activated CaSR plays a significant role in the cross-talk between adipocyte inflammatory and metabolic pathways through the regulation of extracellular sensing.",

            "abstract": "Ferroptotic cell death and cancer Cell death can occur through different mechanisms, several of which are being explored as potential targets for cancer treatment. One form of cell death that has attracted recent interest is ferroptosis, which is triggered by high intracellular levels of lipid reactive oxygen species. Pancreatic cancer cells have high levels of reactive oxygen species but manage to avoid ferroptosis by importing extracellular cysteine. Studying mice bearing pancreatic tumors, Badgley et al. found that administration of a drug inhibiting cysteine import induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited tumor growth. Further work will be required to determine whether this therapeutic strategy will be effective in human pancreatic cancer, a tumor type for which new treatments are urgently needed. Science, this issue p. 85 A drug that lowers intracellular cysteine levels inhibits growth of pancreatic tumors in mice by inducing a specific form of cell death. Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that results from the catastrophic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oncogenic signaling elevates lipid ROS production in many tumor types and is counteracted by metabolites that are derived from the amino acid cysteine. In this work, we show that the import of oxidized cysteine (cystine) via system xC– is a critical dependency of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a leading cause of cancer mortality. PDAC cells used cysteine to synthesize glutathione and coenzyme A, which, together, down-regulated ferroptosis. Studying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system xC– subunit, Slc7a11, induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth. This was replicated through the administration of cyst(e)inase, a drug that depletes cysteine and cystine, demonstrating a translatable means to induce ferroptosis in PDAC.",

However, the underlying mechanism for their action has not been delineated. Here, we investigated the effects of a kokumi taste active and inactive peptide fraction (500–10,000 Da) isolated from mature (FIIm) and immature (FIIim) Ganjang, a typical Korean soy sauce, on salt and umami taste responses in humans and rodents. Only FIIm (0.1–1.0%) produced a biphasic effect in rat chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve responses to lingual stimulation with 100 mM NaCl + 5 μM benzamil, a specific epithelial Na+ channel blocker. Both elevated temperature (42 °C) and FIIm produced synergistic effects on the NaCl + benzamil CT response. At 0.5% FIIm produced the maximum increase in rat CT response to NaCl + benzamil, and enhanced salt taste intensity in human subjects. At 2.5% FIIm enhanced rat CT response to glutamate that was equivalent to the enhancement observed with 1 mM IMP. In human subjects, 0.3% FIIm produced enhancement of umami taste. These results suggest that FIIm modulates amiloride-insensitive salt taste and umami taste at different concentration ranges in rats and humans.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of γ-EV in modulating the TNF-α induced inflammatory responses in endothelial cells via CaSR mediated pathways. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAoECs) were pre-treated (2 h) with γ-EV (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mM). 1 mM pre-treatment of γ-EV significantly reduced the upregulation of inflammatory adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin, by 44.56% and 57.41% respectively. Cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, production was significantly reduced by 40% and 51%, respectively with 1 mM pre-treatment of γ-EV. Similarly, there was a significant reduction in chemokine MCP-1 from a positive control of 9.70 ± 0.52 ng/mL to 6.6 ± 0.43 ng/mL, after γ-EV treatment. The anti-inflammatory effect of γ-EV was attenuated by the treatment of CaSR specific inhibitor, NPS-2143, suggesting the involvement of CaSR mediated pathways. Further studies identified the critical role of key modulators, such as β-arrestin2 and CREB, in mediating the CaSR-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of γ-EV. Lastly, the transport efficiency of γ-EV was evaluated through the monolayer of intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) and the apparent permeability (Papp) of the peptide was found to be 1.56x10-6 cm/sec.",

In this paper, we focus on the dendrite structure of sodium chloride (NaCl) formed by the simple evaporation of an aqueous NaCl solution. The characteristics of the growth structures were measured as a function of the initial concentration of NaCl. In addition, the crystal growth process was measured using optical microscopy. As a result, the growth rate was not constant but was found to oscillate over time and synchronize with the wetting of the crystal. Our observations indicate that dendrite structures are more easily generated at higher initial concentrations. The detailed mechanism for dendrite pattern formation is still under investigation.",

To verify the identity of the GGT and further to characterize the generation of γ-glutamyl peptides, identification of GGT from bovine milk and quantification of kokumi peptides and free amino acids were performed. GGT was purified from skim milk and identified as the bovine protein (G3N2D8), and it reveals that it is composed of two subunits. Sequence alignment with human GGT and molecular mass determination showed that the bovine GGT was glycosylated and contained an N-terminal transmembrane part. Further activity characterization was performed in comparison with GGT from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens in terms of the ability to generate γ-glutamyl peptides from casein hydrolysates. During the transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by both GGT, γ-glutamyl peptides significantly (P < 0.05) increased after γ-glutamylation; addition of glutamine contributed to the generation of γ-glutamyl peptides, suggesting that glutamine could act as a γ-glutamyl donor. This study reveals that the GGT of skim milk membranes is a glycosylated membrane protein that can generate γ-glutamyl peptides.",

            "abstract": "Obesity is associated with perturbations in incretin production and whole-body glucose metabolism, but the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which mediates the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +), a key regulator of cellular energy metabolism, plays a critical role in obesity-associated intestinal pathophysiology and systemic metabolic complications. To this end, we generated a novel mouse model, namely intestinal epithelial cell-specific Nampt knockout (INKO) mice. INKO mice displayed diminished glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) production, at least partly contributing to reduced early-phase insulin secretion and postprandial hyperglycemia. Mechanistically, loss of NAMPT attenuated the Wnt signaling pathway, resulting in insufficient GLP-1 production. We also found that diet-induced obese mice had compromised intestinal NAMPT-mediated NAD + biosynthesis and the Wnt signaling pathway, associated with impaired GLP-1 production and whole-body glucose metabolism, resembling the INKO mice. Finally, administration of a key NAD + intermediate, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), restored intestinal NAD + levels and obesity-associated metabolic derangements, manifested by a decrease in ileal Proglucagon expression and GLP-1 production as well as postprandial hyperglycemia in INKO and diet-induced obese mice. Collectively, our study provides mechanistic and therapeutic insights into intestinal NAD + biology related to obesity-associated dysregulation of GLP-1 production and postprandial hyperglycemia.",

These compounds provide an operable approach for reducing sodium uptake without losing the palatability of foods. γ-Glu-Arg was hinted to have a taste-enhancing effect in the past, but few research studies have focused on it. In the present study, a series of γ-glutamyl peptides containing Arg such as γ-Glu-Arg, [γ-Glu](n=2)-Arg, [γ-Glu](n=3)-Arg, [γ-Glu](n=4)-Arg, [γ-Glu](n=5)-Arg, [γ-Glu](n=6)-Arg, [γ-Glu](n=7)-Arg, and [γ-Glu](n=8)-Arg were synthesized using glutaminase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens in the presence of Gln and Arg. A high solid concentration of 30% was found to increase the production of [γ-Glu](1≤n≤4)-Arg. Sensory evaluation revealed that individual [γ-Glu](n=1,2,3,4)-Arg has a slightly bitter and astringent taste. [γ-Glu](n=1,2)-Arg (1.0 mg/mL) significantly increased the umaminess in the mixture of salt and sodium glutamate but showed no significant effect on saltiness in the salt solution, whereas [γ-Glu](n=3,4)-Arg and postenzymatic reaction mixtures (1.0 mg/mL) significantly increased both saltiness and umaminess. [γ-Glu](n=3,4)-Arg and postenzymatic mixtures in the system with 30% solid concentrations showed a high and similar taste-enhancing effect. Moreover, umaminess and saltiness increased 1.9 and 2.4 times in the simulated broth, respectively, while saltiness increased 1.5 times in the salt solution by the addition of postenzymatic reaction mixtures in the system with 30% solid concentrations at 20.0 mg/mL. These results indicated that [γ-Glu](n=1,2,3,4)-Arg and postenzymatic reaction mixtures rich in [γ-Glu](n≥1)-Arg were potential salt or umami enhancers.",

            "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effect of γ-glutamyl peptides (γEL, γEV, and γEγEV) and l-glutamate (MSG) on the activation of the umami receptor (T1R1/T1R3) in relation to enhanced umami taste and promoted cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion. The synergy of γ-glutamyl peptides and MSG (1-15 mM, 1:1) caused a significant increase in both the umami taste score by 0.218 ± 0.015-1.216 ± 0.031 times and the CCK secretion by 41.41 ± 6.46-201.16 ± 12.91% when compared to the group treated with individual MSG. The increase in CCK secretion promoted by γ-glutamyl peptides was only reduced by 11.54 ± 0.01-45.65 ± 3.58% after adding yjr CaSR inhibitor (NPS 2143), implying that there were other receptors besides CaSR involved in the stimulation of CCK secretion. The mixture of γEγEV and MSG synergistically increased the intracellular calcium release by 111.26 ± 11.94-135.28 ± 16.60% in STC-1 and 108.47 ± 7.89-152.33 ± 26.26% in HEK 293 compared to MSG. The protein expression for T1R1/T1R3 was increased, indicating that the mixture can activate T1R1/T1R3. The amino acids V277, S147, and D190 of T1R3 can be critical for the binding of γEγEV to T1R3. This is the first report on the synergistic effect of taste-active substances on taste sensation and hormone release via taste receptor activation.",

            "title": "Streamlined Efficient Synthesis and Antioxidant Activity of γ-[Glutamyl](n≥1)-tryptophan Peptides by Glutaminase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens",
            "abstract": "As a group of naturally occurring peptides in various foods, γ-glutamyl peptides possess a unique Kokumi taste and health benefits. However, few studies have focused on the functionality of γ-glutamyl peptides. In this study, the γ-[glutamyl] (n=1, 2, 3)-tryptophan peptides were synthesized from a solution of glutamine (Gln) and tryptophan (Trp) employing L-glutaminase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Four different γ-glutamyl peptides were identified from the reaction mixture by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Under optimal conditions of pH 10, 37 °C, 3 h, 0.1 mol/L Gln: 0.1 mol/L Trp = 1:3, and glutaminase at 0.1% (m/v), the yields of γ-l-glutamyl-l-tryptophan (γ-EW), γ-l-glutamyl-γ-l-glutamyl-l-tryptophan (γ-EEW) and γ-l-glutamyl-γ-l-glutamyl-γ-l-glutamyl-l-tryptophan (γ-EEEW) were 51.02%, 26.12% and 1.91% respectively. The antioxidant properties of the reaction mixture and the two peptides (γ-EW, γ-EEW) identified from the reaction media were further compared. Results showed that γ-EW exhibited the highest DPPH•, ABTS•+ and O2•−-scavenging activity (EC50 = 0.2999 mg/mL, 67.6597 μg/mL and 5.99 mg/mL, respectively) and reducing power (EC50 = 4.61 mg/mL), while γ-EEW demonstrated the highest iron-chelating activity (76.22%). Thus, the synthesized mixture may be used as a potential source of antioxidant peptides for food and nutraceutical applications.",

In this study, the taste mechanisms of umami and bitter peptides from Chouguiyu were compared. After molecular docking of core umami (NWDDMEK, WFKDEEF, EEEKPKF, DFDDIQK, and DGEKVDF) and bitter (VQDVLKL, VELLKLE, LVVDGVK, VVDLTVR, and VVDGVKL) peptides with T1R1/T1R3 and TASR14, respectively, salt bridges and conventional hydrogen bonds were the main interactions in all taste peptides, in which acidic amino acid residues contributed to the interaction with their receptors. The taste intensity of peptides after solid-phase synthesis was further verified using electronic tongue technology. Spearman correlation analysis showed that docking energy was an important factor for the intensity of taste peptides, while interaction energy and the distance between the binding unit (BU) and the stimulating unit (SU) were also responsible for the bitter intensity. This study provides a theoretical basis to screen novel taste peptides with high taste intensity in fermented foods.",

This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of Gcls from strains of L. reuteri in the formation of kokumi-active γ-glutamyl dipeptides in sourdough bread. Among 12 acceptor amino acids, the three Gcls of L. reuteri were the most active to Cys. With the acceptor amino acids Ile, Leu, and Phe, Gcl1 was more active than Gcl2 and Gcl3. Accordingly, Gcl1 contributed to the γ-Glu-Ile synthesis in sourdough fermentation. Proofing and baking strongly influenced the concentration of γ-glutamyl dipeptides in bread. The addition of 10% sourdough increased the content of γ-Glu-Leu and γ-Glu-Phe but not of other γ-glutamyl dipeptides in bread. In conclusion, the accumulation of kokumi γ-glutamyl dipeptides in sourdoughs was attributed to the combined activity of cereal enzymes, γ-glutamyl-cysteine ligases, and other microbial enzymes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Taste peptides are oligopeptides that enhance both aroma and taste of food, and they are classified into five categories based on their taste characteristics: salty, sour, umami, sweet, bitter, and kokumi peptide. Recently, taste peptides have attracted the attention of several fields of research in food science and commercial applications. However, research on taste receptors of taste peptides and their taste transduction mechanisms are not clearly understood and we present a comprehensive review about these topics here. This review covers the aspects of taste peptides perceived by their receptors in taste cells, the proposed transduction pathway, as well as structural features of taste peptides. Apart from traditional methods, molecular docking, peptidomic analysis, cell and animal models and taste bud biosensors can be used to explore the taste mechanism of taste peptides. Furthermore, synergistic effect, Maillard reaction, structural modifications and changing external environment are employed to improve the taste of taste peptides. Consequently, we discussed the current challenges and future trends in taste peptide research. Based on the summarized developments, taste peptides derived from food proteins potentially appear to be important taste substances. Their applications meet the principles of “safe, nutritious and sustainable” in food development.",

Understanding the mechanism by which sweet taste is elicited by saccharides, peptides, and proteins will assist science and industry in their search for sweet substances with fewer negative health effects. The original AH-B theories have been supplanted by detailed structural models. Recent identification of the human sweet receptor as a dimeric G-protein coupled receptor comprising T1R2 and T1R3 subunits has greatly increased the understanding of the mechanisms involved in sweet molecule binding and sweet taste transduction. This review discusses early theories of the sweet receptor, recent research of sweetener chemoreception of nonprotein and protein ligands, homology modeling, the transduction pathway, the possibility of the sweet receptor functioning allosterically, as well as the implications of allelic variation.",

Sugar appetite is also enhanced by the post-oral reinforcing actions of the nutrient in the gut. Here, we examined the contribution of gut T1R3 (either alone or as part of the T1R3+T1R3 receptor) to post-oral sugar reinforcement using a flavor-conditioning paradigm. We trained mice to associate consumption of a flavored solution (CS+) with intragastric (IG) infusions of a sweetener, and a different flavored solution (CS-) with IG infusions of water (23 h/day); then, we measured preference in a CS+ vs. CS- choice test. In experiment 1, we predicted that if activation of gut T1R3 mediates sugar reinforcement, then IG infusions of a nutritive (sucrose) or nonnutritive (sucralose) ligand for this receptor should condition a preference for the CS+ in B6 wild-type (WT) mice. While the mice that received IG sucrose infusions developed a strong preference for the CS+, those that received IG sucralose infusions developed a weak avoidance of the CS+. In experiment 2, we used T1R3 knockout (KO) mice to examine the necessity of gut T1R2+T1R3 receptors for conditioned flavor preferences. If intact gut T1R3 (or T1R2+T1R3) receptors are necessary for flavor-sugar conditioning, then T1R3 KO mice should not develop a sugar-conditioned flavor preference. We found that T1R3 KO mice, like WT mice, acquired a strong preference for the CS+ paired with IG sucrose infusions. The KO mice were also like WT mice in avoiding a CS+ flavor paired with IG sucralose infusions These findings provide clear evidence that gut T1R3 receptors are not necessary for sugar-conditioned flavor preferences or sucralose-induced flavor avoidance in mice.",

The measurement of a point of subjective equality (PSE) showed that the peptide increases the flavor characteristics but did not affect the intensity of basic tastes, such as sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and umami. However, the threshold value of GSH decreased significantly in an umami solution containing 0.05% each of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and disodium inosinate (IMP). This suggests that GSH interacts with the umami substance and has a certain effect on the flavor. GSH had a characteristic kokumi flavor, such as continuity, mouthfulness, and thickness in the umami solution as well as in a model beef extract constructed from analyzed components at a concentration of 0.02% w/v. Some foodstuffs, including meat, were found to contain GSH above its threshold value, which implicates the contribution of GSH to the flavor. The thermal degradation study suggested that a part of GSH have changed into its disulfide, pyroglutamic acid (PCA), and cyclocysteinylglycine in cooked foodstuffs.",

However, the effects of glutathione on brain activity associated with taste sensation on the tongue have not been determined under standardized taste delivery conditions. In this study, we investigated the sensory effect of glutathione on taste with no effect of the smell when glutathione added to a combined umami and salty taste stimulus. Twenty-six volunteers (12 women and 14 men; age 19-27 years) performed a sensory evaluation of taste of a solution of monosodium L-glutamate and sodium chloride, with and without glutathione. The addition of glutathione changed taste qualities and significantly increased taste intensity ratings under standardized taste delivery conditions (P < 0.001). Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that glutathione itself elicited significant activation in the left ventral insula. These results are the first to demonstrate the enhancing effect of glutathione as reflected by brain data while tasting an umami and salty mixture.",

The high-molecular-weight peptide fractions fractionated by ion-exchange chromatographies and ultrafiltration enhanced sweetness and umami as well as sourness and bitterness of the fish sauce, and increased several flavor characteristics including continuity, first taste and aftertaste. Thus, it is apparent that large amounts of peptides produced during the long-term fermentation of fish sauce are responsible for the complicated taste of the sauce. From each fraction, 17 peptides in total were isolated and determined for their amino acid sequences. These di-, tri- and tetra-peptides synthesized by solid- or liquid-phase method gave any one of bitter, sour, umami taste, or practically no taste in the absence of salt. In the presence of 0.3% NaCl, however, almost all peptides showed sweet and umami tastes. Other than these 17 peptides, there existed many other kinds of peptides in the fish sauce. Thus, these peptides are thought to contribute to the overall taste of the fish sauce.",

Compared with a conventional synthesis, the process was shortened by two steps and the purification was made much easier in the new one. Consequently, Orn-Tau was easily obtained and subjected to a further series of experiments. The product produced a good saltiness without Na+ in the presence of HCl, and the saltiness became stronger as the amount of added HCl increased. The best quality of saltiness was obtained by adding 1.2 equiv of HCl to the Orn-Tau solutions. The Orn-Tau·1.2HCl was equally salty to NaCl on a molar basis and also had an enhancing effect on saltiness of NaCl. The intake of Na+ could be cut by 95% in a model system and by 50% in a food material (soy sauce) by using Orn-Tau·1.2HCl, which have the most excellent saltiness and Na+ dietary effect of our NaCl substitutes at the present time.

            "In general, depending on differences in the amiloride sensitivity of taste receptors in taste buds, the taste transduction mechanism of saltiness can be divided into amiloride-insensitive and amiloride-sensitive interactions (Lindemann 2001; Le et al. 2022 (TRPV1) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (Lindemann 2001; Le et al. 2022).",

In the salty and umami peptide of S. rugosoannulata, the distribution of non-polar hydrophobic amino acids and polar-uncharged amino acids accounted for a relatively high proportion, and the proportion of polar-uncharged amino acids further increased, with the extension of the peptide chain. P, F, I, l, V, G, S, T, and D were the amino acids with a high proportion in the peptides. The taste peptides can bind to more than 60% of the active amino acid residues in the cavity-binding domain of the T1R1/T1R3 receptors. Hydrogen bond interaction was the primary mode of interaction between the peptides and the receptor. The first and second amino acid residues (such as S, V, E, K, G, and A) at the C-terminal and N-terminal of the peptides were easy to bind to T1R1/T1R3 receptors. Asp108, Asn150, Asp147, Glu301, Asp219, Asp243, Glu70, Asp218 in T1R1, and Glu45, Glu148, Glu301, Glu48, and Ala46 in TIR3 were the key active amino acid sites of taste peptides binding to T1R1/T1R3 receptors.",

            "abstract": "Taste receptor T1R1-T1R3 can be activated by binding to several natural ligands, e.g., L-glutamate and 5’-ribonucleotides etc., thereby stimulating the umami taste. The molecular mechanism of umami recognition at an atomic level, however, remains elusive. Here, using homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate the effects of five natural umami ligands on the structural dynamics of T1R1-T1R3. Our work identifies the key residues that are directly involved in recognizing the binding ligands. In addition, two adjacent binding sites in T1R1 are determined for substrate binding, and depending on the molecular size and chemical properties of the incoming ligand, one or both these binding sites can be occupied. More interestingly, the binding of varied ligands can lead to either closing or opening of T1R1, based on which, we further classify the five ligands into two groups. This different binding effects are likely associated with the distinct umami signals stimulated by various ligands. This work warrants new experimental assays to further validate the theoretical model and provides guidance to design more effective umami ligands. Author summary Umami, as the fifth basic taste, is induced by umami substances from the natural food, such as L-glutamate, 5’-ribonucleotides, and peptides etc. These umami substances are widely added to foods as flavor enhancers to promote food quality. However, although extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to revealing the recognition mechanisms of the taste receptor T1R1-T1R3 to the umami ligands, the detailed molecular mechanism is still unknown, largely due to the lack of the receptor structure. Here, using a new template structure different from the former theoretical studies, we constructed a more accurate homology model of T1R1-T1R3. Based on this receptor model, combined with molecular docking and MD simulations, we investigate how different ligands with varied molecular size and chemical groups might affect the dynamics of T1R1. Our work provides the structural basis for relating the dynamics of umami receptor induced by varied ligands to the resulting umami signal.",

However, the underlying mechanism for their action has not been delineated. Here, we investigated the effects of a kokumi taste active and inactive peptide fraction (500–10,000 Da) isolated from mature (FIIm) and immature (FIIim) Ganjang, a typical Korean soy sauce, on salt and umami taste responses in humans and rodents. Only FIIm (0.1–1.0%) produced a biphasic effect in rat chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve responses to lingual stimulation with 100 mM NaCl + 5 μM benzamil, a specific epithelial Na+ channel blocker. Both elevated temperature (42 °C) and FIIm produced synergistic effects on the NaCl + benzamil CT response. At 0.5% FIIm produced the maximum increase in rat CT response to NaCl + benzamil, and enhanced salt taste intensity in human subjects. At 2.5% FIIm enhanced rat CT response to glutamate that was equivalent to the enhancement observed with 1 mM IMP. In human subjects, 0.3% FIIm produced enhancement of umami taste. These results suggest that FIIm modulates amiloride-insensitive salt taste and umami taste at different concentration ranges in rats and humans.",

Based on our previous chorda tympani taste nerve recordings in rodents and human sensory evaluations, we proposed that N-geranylcyclopropylcarboxamide (NGCC), a novel synthetic compound, acts as a salt taste enhancer by modulating the amiloride/benzamil-insensitive Na+ entry pathways. As an extension of this work, we investigated NGCC-induced human TRPV1 (hTRPV1) activation using a Ca2+-flux signaling assay in cultured cells. NGCC enhanced Ca2+ influx in hTRPV1-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 115 µM). NGCC-induced Ca2+ influx was significantly attenuated by ruthenium red (RR; 30 µM), a non-specific blocker of TRP channels and capsazepine (CZP; 5 µM), a specific antagonist of TRPV1, implying that NGCC directly activates hTRPV1. TRPA1 is often co-expressed with TRPV1 in sensory neurons. Therefore, we also investigated the effects of NGCC on hTRPA1-expressing cells. Similar to hTRPV1, NGCC enhanced Ca2+ influx in hTRPA1-expressing cells (EC50 = 83.65 µM). The NGCC-induced Ca2+ influx in hTRPA1-expressing cells was blocked by RR (30 µM) and HC-030031 (100 µM), a specific antagonist of TRPA1. These results suggested that NGCC selectively activates TRPV1 and TRPA1 in cultured cells. These data may provide additional support for our previous hypothesis that NGCC interacts with TRPV1 variant cation channel, a putative amiloride/benzamil-insensitive salt taste pathway in the anterior taste receptive field.",

To provide a functional context for these findings, we trained Trpv1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice (n = 9 or 10/group) in a two-response operant discrimination procedure and measured detection thresholds to NaCl and KCl with and without amiloride. The KO and WT mice had similar detection thresholds for NaCl and KCl. Amiloride shifted the NaCl sensitivity curve to the same degree in both groups and had virtually no effect on KCl thresholds. In addition, a more detailed analysis of chorda tympani nerve (CT) responses to NaCl, with and without benzamil (Bz, an amiloride analog) treatment revealed that the tonic portion of the CT response of KO mice to NaCl + Bz was absent, but both KO and WT mice displayed some degree of a phasic response to NaCl with and without Bz. Because these transients constitute the entire CT response to NaCl + Bz in Trpv1 KO mice, it is possible that these signals are sufficient to maintain normal NaCl detectabilty in the behavioral task used here. Additionally, there may be other amiloride-insensitive salt transduction mechanisms in taste receptor fields other than the anterior tongue that maintain normal salt detection performance in the KO mice.",

            "abstract": "Salt taste in mammals can trigger two divergent behavioural responses. In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a non-selective detector for a wide range of salts. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities—sweet, sour, bitter and umami—are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCα in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice.",

Because excess sodium intake is associated with many health problems, it could be useful to have salt taste enhancers that are not sodium based. In this study, the regulation of NaCl-induced responses was investigated in cultured human fungiform taste papillae (HBO) cells with five arginyl dipeptides: Ala-Arg (AR), Arg-Ala (RA), Arg-Pro (RP), Arg-Glu (RE), and Glu-Arg (ER); and two non-arginyl dipeptides: Asp-Asp (DD) and Glu-Asp (ED). AR, RA, and RP significantly increased the number of cell responses to NaCl, whereas no effect was observed with RE, ER, DD, or ED. We also found no effects with alanine, arginine, or a mixture of both amino acids. Pharmacological studies showed that AR significantly increased responses of amiloride-sensitive but not amiloride-insensitive cells. In studies using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), responses to AR were significantly decreased in cells transfected with siRNAs against epithelial sodium channel ENaCα or ENaCδ compared to untransfected cells. AR dramatically increased NaCl-elicited responses in cells transfected with NHE1 siRNA but not in those transfected with ENaCα or ENaCδ siRNAs. Altogether, AR increased responses of amiloride-sensitive cells required ENaCα and ENaCδ.",

The effect of MRPs was investigated on human salt taste and on the chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve responses to NaCl in Sprague–Dawley rats, wild-type, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) knockout mice. MRPs produced a biphasic effect on human salt taste perception and on the CT responses in rats and wild-type mice in the presence of NaCl + benzamil (Bz, a blocker of epithelial Na+ channels), enhancing the NaCl response at low concentrations and suppressing it at high concentrations. The effectiveness of MRPs as salt taste enhancers varied with the conjugated sugar moiety: galacturonic acid = glucosamine > xylose > fructose > glucose. The concentrations at which MRPs enhanced human salt taste were significantly lower than the concentrations of MRPs that produced increase in the NaCl CT response. Elevated temperature, resiniferatoxin, capsaicin, and ethanol produced additive effects on the NaCl CT responses in the presence of MRPs. Elevated temperature and ethanol also enhanced human salt taste perception. N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamid (a blocker of TRPV1t) inhibited the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT responses in the absence and presence of MRPs. TRPV1 knockout mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response in the absence or presence of MRPs. The results suggest that MRPs modulate human salt taste and the NaCl + Bz CT responses by interacting with TRPV1t.",

In the tongue, TRPV1 expression has been reported also in the epithelium. This indicates a possibility that sensation is first received by the epithelium. However, how nerves receive sensations from the epithelium remains unclear. To clarify the anatomical basis of this interaction, we performed immunohistochemical studies in the rodent tongue to detect TRPV1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neural marker. Strong expression of TRPV1 in the epithelium was observed and was restricted to the apex of the tongue. Double immunohistochemical staining revealed that CGRP-expressing nerve terminals were in close apposition to the strongly TRPV1-expressing epithelium of fungiform papilla in the apex of rodent tongues. These results suggest that the TRPV1-expressing epithelium monitors the oral environment and acquired information may then be conducted to the adjacent CGRP-expressing terminals.",

In rats and WT mice, RTX increased the NaCl+Bz chorda tympani responses between 0.25x10(-6) and 1x10(-6) M and inhibited the responses above 1x10(-6) M. Decreasing taste receptor cell (TRC) [Ca2+]i with BAPTA loading, activation of PKC with 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (PMA), or inhibition of PP2B by cyclosporin A or FK-506, enhanced the magnitude of the Bz-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani responses in the presence of RTX and either minimized or completely eliminated the decrease in the chorda tympani response>1x10(-6) M RTX. In contrast, increasing TRC [Ca2+]i with ionomycin inhibited Bz-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani responses in the presence of RTX. No effect of the cited modulators was observed on the chorda tympani responses in WT mice and rats in the presence of TRPV1 blocker SB-366791 (1x10(-6) M) or in TRPV1 KO mice. 32P-labeling demonstrated direct phosphorylation of TRPV1 or TRPV1t in anterior lingual epithelium by PMA, cyclosporin A, or FK-506. PMA also enhanced the RTX-sensitive unilateral apical Na+ flux in polarized fungiform TRC in vitro. We conclude that TRPV1 or its variant TRPV1t is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by PKC and PP2B, respectively, and either sensitizes or desensitizes the Bz-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani responses to RTX stimulation.",

Assessments of the commercial promise of eight synthetic and eight natural non-caloric sweeteners are made relevant to these metrics. High-potency (HP) non-caloric sweeteners, both synthetic and natural, are generally limited in taste quality by (a) low maximal sweetness response, (b) \"off\" tastes, (c) slow-onset sweet tastes that linger, and (d) sweet tastes that adapt or desensitize the gustatory system. Formulation approaches to address these limitations are discussed. Enhancement of the normal sucrose sensory response by action of a sweetener receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM) has been achieved with very significant calorie reduction and with retention of the taste quality of sucrose. Research on PAM discovery over the past decade is summarized.",

            "abstract": "Salt sensing in animals involves the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). If ENaC were involved in human salt sensing, then the lingual surface potential (LSP) would hyperpolarize when exposed to sodium. We developed a chamber to measure the LSP while different solutions superfused the surface of the tongue and a technique to adjust for the junction potentials induced by varying salt concentrations. Changing the superfusion solution from rinse solution (30 mM KCl) to 300 mM NaCl (+30 mM KCl) caused the LSP to hyperpolarize by 10.1 +/- 0.7 mV (n = 13, P < 0.001). With repeated challenge the LSP response was reproducible. Increasing the Na concentration from 100 to 600 mM increased hyperpolarization by 35 +/- 4.8% (n = 9, P < 0.001). To examine whether amiloride affects the LSP, 0.1 mM amiloride was added to 300 mM NaCl; it reduced the hyperpolarization by 18.5 +/- 4.3% (P < 0.005, n = 11). However, the amiloride effect was not uniform: in six volunteers, amiloride inhibited the LSP by as much as 42%, while in five subjects, amiloride inhibited <5% of the LSP. In an amiloride sensitive volunteer, amiloride exerted 50% of its effect at 1 microM. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the LSP can be measured in humans, that Na hyperpolarizes the LSP, that increasing the Na concentration increases LSP hyperpolarization, and that amiloride inhibits the Na evoked LSP in some humans. While ENaC is involved in sensing salt, its role appears to vary among individuals.",

This “anion effect” has been hypothesized to result from inhibitory transepithelial potentials (TPs) generated across the lingual epithelium as cations permeate through tight junctions and leave their larger and less permeable anions behind (Ye et al., 1991). We tested directly the necessity of TPs for the anion effect by measuring responses to NaCl and Na-gluconate (small and large anion sodium salts, respectively) in isolated taste cells from mouse circumvallate papillae. Using calcium imaging, we identified AI salt-responsive type III taste cells and demonstrated that they compose a subpopulation of acid-responsive taste cells. Even in the absence of TPs, many (66%) AI salt-responsive type III taste cells still exhibited the anion effect, demonstrating that some component of the transduction machinery for salty taste in type III cells is sensitive to anion size. We hypothesized that osmotic responses could explain why a minority of type III cells (34%) had AI salt responses but lacked anion sensitivity. All AI type III cells had osmotic responses to cellobiose, which were significantly modulated by extracellular sodium concentration, suggesting the presence of a sodium-conducting osmotically sensitive ion channel. However, these responses were significantly larger in AI type III cells that did not exhibit the anion effect. These findings indicate that multiple mechanisms could underlie AI salt responses in type III taste cells, one of which may contribute to the anion effect. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding the mechanisms underlying salty taste will help inform strategies to combat the health problems associated with NaCl overconsumption by humans. Of the two pathways underlying salty taste in mammals, the amiloride-insensitive (AI) pathway is the least understood. Using calcium imaging of isolated mouse taste cells, we identify two separate populations of AI salt-responsive type III taste cells distinguished by their sensitivity to anion size and show that these cells compose subpopulations of acid-responsive taste cells. We also find evidence that a sodium-conducting osmotically sensitive mechanism contributes to salt responses in type III taste cells. Our data not only provide new insights into the transduction mechanisms of AI salt taste but also have important implications for general theories of taste encoding.",

        "abstract": "The salt taste-enhancing and antioxidant effect of the Maillard reaction on peanut protein hydrolysates (PPH) was explored. The multi-spectroscopic and sensory analysis results showed that the Maillard reaction products (MRPs) of hexose (glucose and galactose) had slower reaction rates than those of pentose (xylose and arabinose), but stronger umami and increasing saltiness effects. The Maillard reaction can improve the flavor of PPH, and the galactose-Maillard reaction product (Ga-MRP) has the best umami and salinity-enhancing effects. The measured molecular weight of Ga-MRP were all below 3000 Da, among which the molecular weights between 500–3000 Da accounted for 46.7%. The products produced during the Maillard reaction process resulted in a decrease in brightness and an increase in red value of Ga-MRP. The amino acid analysis results revealed that compared with PPH, the content of salty and umami amino acids in Ga-MRPs decreased, but their proportion in total free amino acids increased, and the content of bitter amino acids decreased. In addition, the Maillard reaction enhances the reducing ability, DPPH radical scavenging ability, and Fe2+ chelating ability of PPH. Therefore, the Maillard reaction product of peanut protein can be expected to be used as a substitute for salt seasoning, with excellent antioxidant properties.",

            "abstract": "Peanut worm (Sipunculus nudus Linn.) protein was hydrolyzed by three proteases, and NO scavenging activity of the protein hydrolysates was evaluated. The hydrolysate obtained using Alcalase® showed the highest NO scavenging activity. This hydrolysate was fractionated using 10-, 5-, and 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes, and the lowest MW fraction (<3 kDa) exhibited the highest NO scavenging activity. The <3 kDa fraction was further purified by gel filtration and high-performance liquid chromatographies. The peptides in the HPLC fraction with the strongest anti-NO activity were identified by quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry as LSPLLAAH (821.48 Da) and TVNLAYY (843.42 Da). Both peptides and the corresponding pure synthetic peptides inhibited NO production by RAW 264.7 macrophages without cytotoxicity. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that peptides LSPLLAAH and TVNLAYY reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes iNOS, IL-6, TNF-α, and COX-2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages, suggesting that these peptides are novel anti-inflammatory candidates.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this paper was to investigate the effect of high-intensity ultrasonication (HIU) pretreatment before enzymolysis on structural conformations of walnut protein isolate (WPI) and antioxidant activity of its hydrolysates. Aqueous WPI suspensions were subjected to ultrasonic processing at different power levels (600–2000 W) and times (5–30 min), and then changes in the particle size, zeta (ζ) potential, and structure of WPI were investigated, and antioxidant activity of its hydrolysates was determined. The particle size of the particles of aqueous WPI suspensions was decreased after ultrasound, indicating that sonication destroyed protein aggregates. The ζ-potential values of a protein solution significantly changed after sonication, demonstrating that the original dense structure of the protein was destroyed. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated a change in the secondary structure of WPI after sonication, with a decrease in β-turn and an increase in α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil content. Two absorption peaks of WPI were generated, and the fluorescence emission intensity of the proteins decreased after ultrasonic treatment, indicating that the changes in protein tertiary structure occurred. Moreover, the degree of hydrolysis and the antioxidant activity of the WPI hydrolysates increased after sonication. These results suggest that HIU pretreatment is a potential tool for improving the functional properties of walnut proteins.",

To identify the molecules underlying that so-called kokumi sensation, a sensomics approach was applied on the water-soluble extract (WSE44) of GC44 by combining gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with analytical sensory tools. HPLC-MS/MS experiments on GPC fractions inducing a kokumi sensation when tasted in an aqueous biomimetic taste recombinant solution (rWSE44) enabled the identification of 8 alpha-L-glutamyl and 10 gamma-L-glutamyl dipeptides as candidate kokumi-enhancing molecules. Among those, only the gamma-L-glutamyl dipeptides were found to impart an enhanced kokumi sensation to the matured cheese, whereas none of the alpha-glutamyl peptides were found to be active. Among the gamma-L-glutamyl peptides, the candidates gamma-Glu-Glu, gamma-Glu-Gly, gamma-Glu-Gln, gamma-Glu-Met, gamma-Glu-Leu, and gamma-Glu-His, present in GC44 in concentrations between 4.11 and 17.66 micromol/kg, were identified for the first time as the key kokumi molecules enhancing mouthfulness and complex taste continuity of the matured cheese.",

In the present investigation, the spatial distribution of alpha- and gamma-glutamyl dipeptides in Gouda cheese wheels and the concentration of these peptides in other cheese types were determined by means of HPLC-MS/MS. Among all cheeses investigated, by far the highest gamma-glutamyl peptide concentration (3590 mumol/kg) was found for Blue Shropshire, a blue-veined cheese. To check whether the gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) from Penicillium roquefortii is involved in gamma-glutamyl peptide production in this cheese, the GGT activity was measured and gamma-glutamyl peptides were analyzed in liquid cultures of mold isolated from Blue Shropshire as well as single P. roquefortiii strains incubated with the gamma-glutamyl donor l-glutamine and the candidate substrates l-glutamic acid, l-histidine, l-leucine, and l-methionine. Being well in line with the GGT activity found in Blue Shropshire, P. roquefortii was found for the first time to produce and secrete gamma-glutamyl peptides. Among the amino acids tested, l-methionine was found as a preferred gamma-glutamyl acceptor; for example, gamma-Glu-Met was produced in yields of about 50 mmol/mol and [(2)H(3)]-gamma-Glu-Met was obtained when [(2)H(3)]-l-methionine was used as substrate amino acid.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the possibility of reducing the amount of sodium chloride used in the production of dry fermented sausages by using different salt mixtures to partially replace the sodium chloride. Control sausages were produced only with sodium chloride (3%), while sausages from other groups were produced by partially replacing sodium chloride with other salts in different amounts. In group 1 and 2 sausages, sodium chloride was partially replaced by potassium chloride and in group 3 and 4 sausages, sodium chloride was partially replaced by ammonium chloride. \nModerate reductions of sodium chloride in the dry fermented sausages by partial replacement with potassium chloride ( group 1) and with ammonium chloride (group 4) led to a slight reduction in saltiness, although this was still at an acceptable level. The overall acceptability of sausages from these groups was lower in relation to sausages from the control group, but despite that, their smell, colour and taste were at an acceptable level. \nThe most highly expressed bitterness was determined in group 2 and 3 sausages, and these were significantly more bitter than sausages from other groups. The use of different salt mixtures did not affect redness (a*) or yellowness (b*) in sausages, but led to greater expressed lightness in the sodium-adjusted sausages in comparison to sausages from the control group.",

Yet, none of these substances are currently in wide use, because of their weak saltiness. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of sodium aspartate (Asp-Na) on salty taste perception using the bullfrog glossopharyngeal nerve response and human sensory tests. When added to the mixture of NaCl and KCl, Asp-Na significantly enhanced the glossopharyngeal nerve response to the mixture by 1.6-fold compared to control. Asp-Na did not enhance the response to NaCl, nor did Asp-Na enhance the response to sour, bitter, or umami stimuli. The optimal concentration for Asp-Na to enhance the salt mixture was 1.7mM. The largest enhancement was induced when NaCl and KCl were mixed at equimolar concentrations. Asp-Na significantly suppressed the glossopharyngeal nerve response to quinine hydrochloride, which suggests that bitterness of KCl is suppressed by Asp-Na. The salty taste enhancing effect of Asp-Na was also confirmed with human sensory tests. The present results suggested that the mixture of NaCl and KCl containing Asp-Na can be used as a salt substitute. In addition to demonstrating that Asp-Na enhanced salt taste responses in an experimental animal and human, our findings provide clues to identify the elusive salty taste receptors.",

Salts carrying organic cations such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), choline, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane also produced positive results. 3) The dependence of the umami responses on NaCl and MgCl2 concentrations showed a bell-shaped response curve with the maximal enhancing effect being seen at 100 mM NaCl and 3-10 mM MgCl2. 4) The degree of the enhancement depended not only on the species of the cation, but also on that of anion. For example, 100 mM NaCl showed a much larger enhancing effect than Na phosphate, Na2SO4, and Na4Fe(CN)6 at equimolar Na+. 5) The enhancing effects of salts on the responses to the umami substances could not be simply explained in terms of the permeability of cation and anion of salts. It was speculated that the binding of both cations and anions to the receptor membranes leads to changes in the interaction of the umami substances with the receptor proteins.",

However, the U.S. population still consumes more sodium than is recommended, placing individuals at risk for diseases related to elevated blood pressure. Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States evaluates and makes recommendations about strategies that could be implemented to reduce dietary sodium intake to levels recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The book reviews past and ongoing efforts to reduce the sodium content of the food supply and to motivate consumers to change behavior. Based on past lessons learned, the book makes recommendations for future initiatives. It is an excellent resource for federal and state public health officials, the processed food and food service industries, health care professionals, consumer advocacy groups, and academic researchers.",

        "abstract": "Maillard reacted peptides (MRPs) were synthesized by conjugating a peptide fraction (1000–5000 Da) purified from soy protein hydrolyzate with galacturonic acid, glucosamine, xylose, fructose, or glucose. The effect of MRPs was investigated on human salt taste and on the chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve responses to NaCl in Sprague–Dawley rats, wild-type, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) knockout mice. MRPs produced a biphasic effect on human salt taste perception and on the CT responses in rats and wild-type mice in the presence of NaCl + benzamil (Bz, a blocker of epithelial Na+ channels), enhancing the NaCl response at low concentrations and suppressing it at high concentrations. The effectiveness of MRPs as salt taste enhancers varied with the conjugated sugar moiety: galacturonic acid = glucosamine > xylose > fructose > glucose. The concentrations at which MRPs enhanced human salt taste were significantly lower than the concentrations of MRPs that produced increase in the NaCl CT response. Elevated temperature, resiniferatoxin, capsaicin, and ethanol produced additive effects on the NaCl CT responses in the presence of MRPs. Elevated temperature and ethanol also enhanced human salt taste perception. N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamid (a blocker of TRPV1t) inhibited the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT responses in the absence and presence of MRPs. TRPV1 knockout mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response in the absence or presence of MRPs. The results suggest that MRPs modulate human salt taste and the NaCl + Bz CT responses by interacting with TRPV1t.",

            "abstract": "The effect of ethanol on the amiloride- and benzamil (Bz)-insensitive salt taste receptor was investigated by direct measurement of intracellular Na+ activity ([Na+]i) using fluorescence imaging in polarized fungiform taste receptor cells (TRCs) and by chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve recordings. CT responses to KCl and NaCl were recorded in Sprague-Dawley rats, and in wild-type (WT) and vanilloid receptor-1 (VR-1) knockout mice (KO). CT responses were monitored in the presence of Bz, a specific blocker of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). CT responses were also recorded in the presence of agonists (resiniferatoxin and elevated temperature) and antagonists (capsazepine and SB-366791) of VR-1 that similarly modulate the Bz-insensitive VR-1 variant salt taste receptor. In the absence of mineral salts, ethanol induced a transient decrease in TRC volume and elicited only transient phasic CT responses. In the presence of mineral salts, ethanol increased the apical cation flux in TRCs without a change in volume, increased transepithelial electrical resistance across the tongue, and elicited CT responses that were similar to salt responses, consisting of both a phasic component and a sustained tonic component. At concentrations <50%, ethanol enhanced responses to KCl and NaCl, while at ethanol concentrations >50%, those CT responses were inhibited. Resiniferatoxin and elevated temperature increased the sensitivity of the CT response to ethanol in salt-containing media, and SB-366791 inhibited the effect of ethanol, resiniferatoxin, and elevated temperature on the CT responses to mineral salts. VR-1 KO mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive CT response to NaCl and no sensitivity to ethanol. We conclude that ethanol increases salt taste sensitivity by its direct action on the Bz-insensitive VR-1 variant salt taste receptor.",

TRPV1 antagonists block pain behaviors in rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain, suggesting their utility as analgesics. Here, we report that TRPV1 antagonists representing various chemotypes cause an increase in body temperature (hyperthermia), identifying a potential issue for their clinical development. Peripheral restriction of antagonists did not eliminate hyperthermia, suggesting that the site of action is predominantly outside of the blood–brain barrier. Antagonists that are ineffective against proton activation also caused hyperthermia, indicating that blocking capsaicin and heat activation of TRPV1 is sufficient to produce hyperthermia. All TRPV1 antagonists evaluated here caused hyperthermia, suggesting that TRPV1 is tonically activated in vivo and that TRPV1 antagonism and hyperthermia are not separable. TRPV1 antagonists caused hyperthermia in multiple species (rats, dogs, and monkeys), demonstrating that TRPV1 function in thermoregulation is conserved from rodents to primates. Together, these results indicate that tonic TRPV1 activation regulates body temperature.",

            "abstract": "Both amiloride-sensitive and -insensitive mechanisms contribute to NaCl taste transduction. The amiloride-sensitive mechanism relies on the epithelial Na(+) channel ENaC, which is widely expressed on the apical membrane of fungiform taste cells. The amiloride-insensitive mechanism, which predominates in circumvallate and foliate taste buds, was recently reported to involve a variant of the nonselective cation channel TRPV1. We performed 2-bottle preference and threshold experiments with TRPV1 knockout mice and wild-type (C57BL/6J) controls to test for NaCl preference and detection thresholds in the presence and absence of amiloride. Surprisingly, TRPV1 knockout mice not only detected NaCl in the presence of amiloride but they preferred NaCl over water at concentrations avoided by the wild-type mice. NaCl detection thresholds were between 2 and 3 mM for both genotypes. Amiloride increased the detection thresholds of wild-type mice but not knockout mice. The knockout mice also preferred 100 mM KCl compared with wild-type controls, suggesting that TRPV1 receptors may mediate a general aversive response to salts. Analyses of consumption data also revealed that TRPV1 knockout mice ingested more of the NaCl, with and without amiloride, and KCl solutions than the wild-type mice. However, comparisons of preference ratios and consumption volumes indicated that both wild-type and TRPV1 knockout mice avoided citric acid in quite a similar manner, suggesting that TRPV1 receptors do not mediate the detection of citric acid. These data, taken together, suggest that additional mechanisms must contribute to the amiloride-insensitive NaCl response.",

The apical ion channel is blockable by the diuretic amiloride, whereas the submucosal pathway is not. Sodium salts with small anions, such as NaCl, can stimulate submucosal as well as apical ion channels; sodium salts with large anions, such as Na-gluconate, activate primarily the apical channels. In humans, reports on the effects of amiloride on the taste of NaCl are conflicting and no data exist on the effects of amiloride on organic sodium salts. In the present experiment, subjects gave magnitude estimates of the total intensity and of each of the basic taste qualities for NaCl, Na-gluconate and KCl. Five concentrations of each of these stimuli were presented to the anterior tongue following distilled water adaptation and after amiloride treatment. There was a significant decrease in the total taste intensity of NaCl and Na-gluconate after amiloride, but no effect on KCl. The saltiness of all three salts was unaffected, but amiloride decreased the perceived sourness of the sodium salts. KCl sourness was unaffected by amiloride. There was a proportionately larger effect of amiloride on Na-gluconate than on NaCl, which is consistent with a larger role for the apical ion channel in Na-gluconate transduction. However, an appreciable amiloride-insensitive component is present for both NaCl and Na-gluconate, suggesting that an amiloride-insensitive pathway also plays a role in the transduction of both sodium salts. These data support the hypothesis that an amiloride-sensitive transduction component exists in humans, but suggest that it is considerably smaller than in many other species.",

Heterologously expressed VR1 can be activated by vanilloid compounds, protons, or heat (>43 degrees C), but whether this channel contributes to chemical or thermal sensitivity in vivo is not known. Here, we demonstrate that sensory neurons from mice lacking VR1 are severely deficient in their responses to each of these noxious stimuli. VR1-/- mice showed normal responses to noxious mechanical stimuli but exhibited no vanilloid-evoked pain behavior, were impaired in the detection of painful heat, and showed little thermal hypersensitivity in the setting of inflammation. Thus, VR1 is essential for selective modalities of pain sensation and for tissue injury-induced thermal hyperalgesia.",

        "abstract": "Recently, we reported that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a receptor for kokumi substances, which enhance the intensities of salty, sweet and umami tastes. Furthermore, we found that several γ-glutamyl peptides, which are CaSR agonists, are kokumi substances. In this study, we elucidated the receptor cells for kokumi substances, and their physiological properties. For this purpose, we used Calcium Green-1 loaded mouse taste cells in lingual tissue slices and confocal microscopy. Kokumi substances, applied focally around taste pores, induced an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a subset of taste cells. These responses were inhibited by pretreatment with the CaSR inhibitor, NPS2143. However, the kokumi substance-induced responses did not require extracellular Ca2+. CaSR-expressing taste cells are a different subset of cells from the T1R3-expressing umami or sweet taste receptor cells. These observations indicate that CaSR-expressing taste cells are the primary detectors of kokumi substances, and that they are an independent population from the influenced basic taste receptor cells, at least in the case of sweet and umami.",

            "abstract": "The cloning of a G protein-coupled extracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(o)(2+))-sensing receptor (CaR) has elucidated the molecular basis for many of the previously recognized effects of Ca(o)(2+) on tissues that maintain systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, especially parathyroid chief cells and several cells in the kidney. The availability of the cloned CaR enabled the development of DNA and antibody probes for identifying the CaR's mRNA and protein, respectively, within these and other tissues. It also permitted the identification of human diseases resulting from inactivating or activating mutations of the CaR gene and the subsequent generation of mice with targeted disruption of the CaR gene. The characteristic alterations in parathyroid and renal function in these patients and in the mice with \"knockout\" of the CaR gene have provided valuable information on the CaR's physiological roles in these tissues participating in mineral ion homeostasis. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about how the CaR regulates other tissues involved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, particularly bone and intestine. Moreover, there is evidence that additional Ca(o)(2+) sensors may exist in bone cells that mediate some or even all of the known effects of Ca(o)(2+) on these cells. Even more remains to be learned about the CaR's function in the rapidly growing list of cells that express it but are uninvolved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) metabolism. Available data suggest that the receptor serves numerous roles outside of systemic mineral ion homeostasis, ranging from the regulation of hormonal secretion and the activities of various ion channels to the longer term control of gene expression, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and cellular proliferation. In some cases, the CaR on these \"nonhomeostatic\" cells responds to local changes in Ca(o)(2+) taking place within compartments of the extracellular fluid (ECF) that communicate with the outside environment (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract). In others, localized changes in Ca(o)(2+) within the ECF can originate from several mechanisms, including fluxes of calcium ions into or out of cellular or extracellular stores or across epithelium that absorb or secrete Ca(2+). In any event, the CaR and other receptors/sensors for Ca(o)(2+) and probably for other extracellular ions represent versatile regulators of numerous cellular functions and may serve as important therapeutic targets.",

These characteristics are known as “kokumi taste” and often appear in traditional Japanese cuisine. Although GSH is a typical kokumi taste substance (taste enhancer), its mode of action is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate how the kokumi taste is enhanced by the CaSR, a close relative of the class C G-protein-coupled receptors T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 (sweet and umami receptors). We identified a large number of CaSR agonist γ-glutamyl peptides, including GSH (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) and γ-Glu-Val-Gly, and showed that these peptides elicit the kokumi taste. Further analyses revealed that some known CaSR agonists such as Ca2+, protamine, polylysine, l-histidine, and cinacalcet (a calcium-mimetic drug) also elicit the kokumi taste and that the CaSR-specific antagonist, NPS-2143, significantly suppresses the kokumi taste. This is the first report indicating a distinct function of the CaSR in human taste perception.",

        "abstract": "In addition to the taste receptors corresponding to the six basic taste qualities—sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami, and fatty—another type of taste receptor, calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), is found in taste-bud cells. CaSR is called the ‘kokumi’ receptor because its agonists increase sweet, salty and umami tastes to induce ‘koku’, a Japanese word meaning the enhancement of flavor characters such as thickness, mouthfulness, and continuity. Koku is an important factor for enhancing food palatability. However, it is not well known whether other kokumi-receptors and substances exist. Here, we show that ornithine (L-ornithine but not D-ornithine) at low concentrations that do not elicit a taste of its own, enhances preferences to sweet, salty, umami, and fat taste solutions in mice. Increased preference to monosodium glutamate (MSG) was the most dominant effect. Antagonists of G-protein-coupled receptor family C group 6 subtype A (GPRC6A) abolished the additive effect of ornithine on MSG solutions. The additive effects of ornithine on taste stimuli are thought to occur in the oral cavity, and are not considered post-oral events because ornithine’s effects were confirmed in a brief-exposure test. Moreover, the additive effects of ornithine and the action of the antagonist were verified in electrophysiological taste nerve responses. Immunohistochemical analysis implied that GPRC6A was expressed in subsets of type II and type III taste cells of mouse circumvallate papillae. These results are in good agreement with those reported for taste modulation involving CaSR and its agonists. The present study suggests that ornithine is a kokumi substance and GPRC6A is a newly identified kokumi receptor.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Previous studies have reported that the umami taste of monosodium l-glutamate (MSG) and salty-smelling odors (e.g., soy sauce, bacon, sardines) enhance the perception of saltiness. This study aimed to investigate the neural basis of the enhancement of saltiness in human participants using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). University students who had passed a taste panel test participated in this study. Sodium chloride solutions were presented with or without either 0.10% MSG or the odor of soy sauce. The participants were asked to drink a cup of the stimulus and to evaluate only saltiness intensity in Experiment 1, as well as other sensory qualities in Experiment 2, and temporal brain activity was measured using fNIRS. In Experiment 3, the participants were asked to evaluate saltiness intensity using the time-intensity (TI) method, and the response of the parotid salivary glands was measured using fNIRS. The fNIRS data showed that the added MSG and soy sauce enhanced the hemodynamic response in temporal brain regions, including the frontal operculum, but no effect on the hemodynamic salivary responses was detected. These results indicate that the perceived enhancement of saltiness occurs in the brain region that is involved in central gustatory processing. Furthermore, the results of the sensory evaluations suggest that enhancement of saltiness by the addition of MSG is mainly based on fusion of the salty-like property of MSG and saltiness of NaCl, whereas enhancement by the addition of soy sauce odor is mainly based on modulation of the temporal dynamics of saltiness perception.",

We use an NIRS system to measure extracranial hemodynamics (Hb-signals around the temples) of healthy participants when taste stimuli are taken in their mouths. First, the Hb-signals and volume of expelled saliva (stimulated by distilled-water or sucrose-solution intake) are simultaneously measured and large Hb-signal changes in response to the taste stimuli (Hb-responses) are found. Statistical analysis show that both the Hb response and saliva volume are larger for the sucrose solution than for the distilled water with a significant correlation between them (r = 0.81). The effects of swallowing on the Hb-signals are investigated. Similar Hb responses, differing from the sucrose solution and distilled water, are obtained even though the participants swallow the mouth contents. Finally, functional magnetic resonance imaging is used to identify possible sources of the Hb signals corresponding to salivation. Statistical analysis indicates similar responses in the extracranial regions, mainly around the middle meningeal artery. In conclusion, the identified correlation between extracranial hemodynamics and the saliva volume suggests that NIRS is applicable to the measurement of hemodynamic signals accompanying stimulated saliva secretion.",

        "abstract": "Some foods are known to have flavours that cannot be explained by the five basic tastes alone, such as continuity, mouthfulness and thick flavour. It was demonstrated that these sensations are evoked by the addition of kokumi substances, flavour modifiers that have no taste themselves. However, their mode of action has been poorly understood. During a study on the perception of amino acids and peptides, it was found that glutathione (GSH) was one of the agonists of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). We have hypothesized that CaSR is involved in the perception of kokumi substances. We found that all CaSR agonists tested act as kokumi substances and that a positive correlation exists between the CaSR activity of γ-glutamyl peptides and kokumi intensity. Furthermore, the kokumi intensities of GSH and γ-Glu-Val-Gly, a potent kokumi peptide, were significantly reduced by the CaSR-specific antagonist, NPS-2143. These results suggest that CaSR is involved in the perception of kokumi substances. A potent kokumi peptide, γ-Glu-Val-Gly, enhanced sweetness, saltiness and umami when added to 3.3% sucrose, 0.9% NaCl and 0.5% MSG solutions, respectively. In addition, γ-Glu-Val-Gly enhanced the intensity of continuity, mouthfulness and thick flavour when added to chicken soup and reduced-fat cream. These results suggest that γ-Glu-Val-Gly is a potent kokumi peptide and would be useful for improving the flavour of food.",

Furthermore, we found that several γ-glutamyl peptides, which are CaSR agonists, are kokumi substances. In this study, we elucidated the receptor cells for kokumi substances, and their physiological properties. For this purpose, we used Calcium Green-1 loaded mouse taste cells in lingual tissue slices and confocal microscopy. Kokumi substances, applied focally around taste pores, induced an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a subset of taste cells. These responses were inhibited by pretreatment with the CaSR inhibitor, NPS2143. However, the kokumi substance-induced responses did not require extracellular Ca2+. CaSR-expressing taste cells are a different subset of cells from the T1R3-expressing umami or sweet taste receptor cells. These observations indicate that CaSR-expressing taste cells are the primary detectors of kokumi substances, and that they are an independent population from the influenced basic taste receptor cells, at least in the case of sweet and umami.",

        "abstract": "Taste stimuli that evoke different perceptual qualities (e.g., sweet, umami, bitter, sour, salty) are detected by dedicated subpopulations of taste bud cells that use distinct combinations of sensory receptors and transduction molecules. Here, we report that taste stimuli also elicit unique patterns of neuropeptide secretion from taste buds that are correlated with those perceptual qualities. We measured tastant-dependent secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) from circumvallate papillae of Tas1r3+/+, Tas1r3+/− and Tas1r3 −/− mice. Isolated tongue epithelia were mounted in modified Ussing chambers, permitting apical stimulation of taste buds; secreted peptides were collected from the basal side and measured by specific ELISAs. Appetitive stimuli (sweet: glucose, sucralose; umami: monosodium glutamate; polysaccharide: Polycose) elicited GLP-1 and NPY secretion and inhibited basal glucagon secretion. Sweet and umami stimuli were ineffective in Tas1r3−/− mice, indicating an obligatory role for the T1R3 subunit common to the sweet and umami taste receptors. Polycose responses were unaffected by T1R3 deletion, consistent with the presence of a distinct polysaccharide taste receptor. The effects of sweet stimuli on peptide secretion also required the closing of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, as the KATP channel activator diazoxide inhibited the effects of glucose and sucralose on both GLP-1 and glucagon release. Both sour citric acid and salty NaCl increased NPY secretion but had no effects on GLP-1 or glucagon. Bitter denatonium showed no effects on these peptides. Together, these results suggest that taste stimuli of different perceptual qualities elicit unique patterns of neuropeptide secretion from taste buds.",

            "abstract": "Salt taste in mammals can trigger two divergent behavioural responses. In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a non-selective detector for a wide range of salts. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities—sweet, sour, bitter and umami—are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCα in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice.",

The labeled-line (sparse coding) view differs from the across-neuron pattern (ensemble) counterpoint in proposing that activity in a given class of neurons is necessary and sufficient to generate a specific taste perception. This article critically reviews molecular, electro-physiological, and behavioral findings that bear on the issue. In the peripheral gustatory system, the authors conclude that most qualities appear to be signaled by labeled lines; however, elements of both types of coding characterize signaling of sodium salts. Given the heterogeneity of neuronal tuning functions in the brain, the central coding mechanism is less clear. Both sparse coding and neuronal ensemble models remain viable possibilities. Furthermore, temporal patterns of discharge could contribute additional information. Ultimately, until specific classes of neurons can be selectively manipulated and perceptual consequences assessed, it will be difficult to go beyond mere correlation and conclusively discern the validity of these coding models.",

Because circumvallate papillae (CVPs) express both GLP-1 and its receptor, a local regulation has been suggested. However, whether dietary lipids are involved in this regulation, as shown in the gut, is unknown. By using a combination of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and behavioral approaches, the present data i) confirm the role of GLP-1 signaling in the attraction for sucrose, ii) demonstrate that minute quantities of long-chain FAs (LCFAs) reinforce the attraction for sucrose in a GLP-1 receptor-dependent manner, iii) suggest an involvement of the LCFA receptor GPR120 expressed in taste buds in this system, and iv) support the existence of a regulation by GLP-1 of the lipid sensing mediated by lingual CD36. Therefore, oro-sensory detection of LCFAs may affect sweet and fatty taste responsiveness by controlling the secretion of lingual GLP-1. This regulatory loop, probably triggered by the LCFA-GPR120 interaction, might contribute to the high palatability of foods rich both in fat and sugar.",

In turn, ATP activates adjacent presynaptic (type III) cells to release serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE). The roles of these neurotransmitters in taste buds have not been fully elucidated. Here we tested whether ATP or 5-HT exert feedback onto receptor (type II) cells during taste stimulation. Our previous studies showed NE does not appear to act on adjacent taste bud cells, or at least on receptor cells. Our data show that 5-HT released from presynaptic (type III) cells provides negative paracrine feedback onto receptor cells by activating 5-HT1A receptors, inhibiting taste-evoked Ca2+ mobilization in receptor cells, and reducing ATP secretion. The findings also demonstrate that ATP exerts positive autocrine feedback onto receptor (type II) cells by activating P2Y1 receptors and enhancing ATP secretion. These results begin to sort out how purinergic and aminergic transmitters function within the taste bud to modulate gustatory signaling in these peripheral sensory organs.",

T1R3 is a component of the mammalian sweet taste receptor that mediates the preference for sugars and artificial sweeteners in mammals. We examined the role of the T1R3 receptor in the ingestive response of mice to Polycose and sucrose. In 60-s two-bottle tests, knockout (KO) mice preferred Polycose solutions (4-32%) to water, although their overall preference was lower than WT mice (82% vs. 94%). KO mice also preferred Polycose (0.5-32%) in 24-h two-bottle tests, although less so than WT mice at dilute concentrations (0.5-4%). In contrast, KO mice failed to prefer sucrose to water in 60-s tests. In 24-h tests, KO mice were indifferent to 0.5-8% sucrose, but preferred 16-32% sucrose; this latter result may reflect the post-oral effects of sucrose. Overall sucrose preference and intake were substantially less in KO mice than WT mice. However, when retested with 0.5-32% sucrose solutions, the KO mice preferred all sucrose concentrations, although they drank less sugar than WT mice. The experience-induced sucrose preference is attributed to a post-oral conditioned preference for the T1R3-independent orosensory features of the sugar solutions (odor, texture, T1R2-mediated taste). Chorda tympani nerve recordings revealed virtually no response to sucrose in KO mice, but a near-normal response to Polycose. These results indicate that the T1R3 receptor plays a critical role in the taste-mediated response to sucrose but not Polycose.",

Recent evidence implicates gut-related hormones in taste perception, including glucagon-like peptide 1 and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). We used VIP knockout mice to investigate VIP's specific role in taste perception and connection to energy regulation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Body weight, food intake, and plasma levels of multiple energy-regulating hormones were measured and pancreatic morphology was determined. In addition, the immunocytochemical profile of taste cells and gustatory behavior were examined in wild-type and VIP knockout mice. RESULTS VIP knockout mice demonstrate elevated plasma glucose, insulin, and leptin levels, with no islet β-cell number/topography alteration. VIP and its receptors (VPAC1, VPAC2) were identified in type II taste cells of the taste bud, and VIP knockout mice exhibit enhanced taste preference to sweet tastants. VIP knockout mouse taste cells show a significant decrease in leptin receptor expression and elevated expression of glucagon-like peptide 1, which may explain sweet taste preference of VIP knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the tongue can play a direct role in modulating energy intake to correct peripheral glycemic imbalances. In this way, we could view the tongue as a sensory mechanism that is bidirectionally regulated and thus forms a bridge between available foodstuffs and the intricate hormonal balance in the animal itself.",

            "abstract": "Peptide hormones and their cognate receptors belonging to neuropeptide Y (NPY) family mediate diverse biological functions in a number of tissues. Recently, we discovered the presence of the gut satiation peptide YY (PYY) in saliva of mice and humans and defined its role in the regulation of food intake and body weight maintenance. Here we report the systematic analysis of expression patterns of all NPY receptors (Rs), Y1R, Y2R, Y4R, and Y5R in lingual epithelia in mice. Using four independent assays, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and RT PCR, we show that the morphologically different layers of the keratinized stratified epithelium of the dorsal layer of the tongue express Y receptors in a very distinctive yet overlapping pattern. In particular, the monolayer of basal progenitor cells expresses both Y1 and Y2 receptors. Y1Rs are present in the parabasal prickle cell layer and the granular layer, while differentiated keratinocytes display abundant Y5Rs. Y4Rs are expressed substantially in the neuronal fibers innervating the lamina propria and mechanoreceptors. Basal epithelial cells positive for Y2Rs respond robustly to PYY3–36 by increasing intracellular Ca2+ suggesting their possible functional interaction with salivary PYY. In taste buds of the circumvallate papillae, some taste receptor cells (TRCs) express YRs localized primarily at the apical domain, indicative of their potential role in taste perception. Some of the YR-positive TRCs are co-localized with neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), suggesting that these TRCs may have synaptic contacts with nerve terminals. In summary, we show that all YRs are abundantly expressed in multiple lingual cell types, including epithelial progenitors, keratinocytes, neuronal dendrites and TRCs. These results suggest that these receptors may be involved in the mediation of a wide variety of functions, including proliferation, differentiation, motility, taste perception and satiation.",

Using a combination of Ca2+ imaging, single-cell reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunostaining, we show that GABA is an inhibitory transmitter in mouse taste buds, acting on GABAA and GABAB receptors to suppress transmitter (ATP) secretion from receptor cells during taste stimulation. Specifically, receptor cells express GABAA receptor subunits β2, δ, and π, as well as GABAB receptors. In contrast, presynaptic cells express the GABAA β3 subunit and only occasionally GABAB receptors. In keeping with the distinct expression pattern of GABA receptors in presynaptic cells, we detected no GABAergic suppression of transmitter release from presynaptic cells. We suggest that GABA may serve function(s) in taste buds in addition to synaptic inhibition. Finally, we also defined the source of GABA in taste buds: GABA is synthesized by GAD65 in type I taste cells as well as by GAD67 in presynaptic (type III) taste cells and is stored in both those two cell types. We conclude that GABA is an inhibitory transmitter released during taste stimulation and possibly also during growth and differentiation of taste buds.",

To date, two peptides, cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal peptide, have been localized to subsets of taste-bud (TB) cells (TBC) and one, cholecystokinin, has been demonstrated to produce excitatory physiological actions. This study extends our knowledge of neuropeptides in TBC in three significant ways. First, using techniques of immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR, evidence is presented for the expression of a third peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY). Like other peptide expression patterns, NPY expression is circumscribed to a subset of cells within the taste bud. Second, using physiological studies, we demonstrate that NPY specifically enhances an inwardly rectifying potassium current via NPY-Y1 receptors. This action is antagonistic to the previously demonstrated inhibitory effect exerted by cholecystokinin on the same current, thus providing important clues to their signaling roles in the TB. Third, using the technique of double-labeled fluorescent immunocytochemistry, the relationship of three subsets of neuropeptide-expressing TB cells to one another was examined. Remarkably, NPY expressions, although fewer in number than either the cholecystokinin or vasoactive intestinal peptide subsets, overlapped 100% with either peptide. Collectively, these three observations transform previously suggestive roles of neuromodulation by peptides in TB cells to more concrete signaling pathways. The extensive colocalization of these peptides suggests they may be subject to similar presynaptic influences of release yet have antagonistic postsynaptic actions. The convergence or divergence of these postsynaptic actions awaits further investigation.",

We have previously demonstrated the existence of a proximal-distal enteroendocrine loop mediated by glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), through which intestinal PGDP secretion is stimulated after placement of nutrients in the duodenum. To study the possible involvement of neuropeptides in this loop, we infused gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) into anesthetized rats at 47, 235, or 470 ng/h. GRP stimulated secretion of the intestinal PGDPs only at the highest dose, from 250 +/- 18 to 321 +/- 9 pg/ml (P < 0.05). Gastrin secretion was also increased by GRP infusion (from 20 +/- 7 to 75 +/- 19 pg/ml; P < 0.05); however, GIP release was not altered from basal levels. Placement of fat into the duodenum stimulated the secretion of both the intestinal PGDPs and GIP (to 618 +/- 221 and 417 +/- 154 pg/ml above basal, respectively; P < 0.05). However, infusion of the GRP antagonist, BW10 (3 ng/h), completely abrogated the PGDP response to duodenal fat (P < 0.05). In contrast, the GIP response was reduced by 56 +/- 15% (P < 0.05) with BW10 administration, but remained elevated compared to the basal level (P < 0.05). Removal of the entire intestine distal to the fat-infused duodenal segment prevented the rise in intestinal PGDPs, but not that of GIP, demonstrating the distal and proximal origins of these peptides, respectively. Thus, placement of fat into the duodenum stimulated the release of the PGDPs from the distal intestine through a GRP-dependent mechanism. Although GIP plays a role in regulating intestinal PGDP secretion in the rat, GRP appears to exert its effects independent of changes in GIP.",

        "abstract": "The intake of dietary salt through food now exceeds current nutritional recommendations and is thought to have negative effects on human health, such as the increasing prevalence of hypertension. This study was performed to investigate whether W1/O/W2 double emulsions can be used to enhance the saltiness of cheese without increasing the salt content (W1 is distilled water or 1% abalone hydrolysate, and W2 is 1% NaCl or 1% abalone hydrolysate + 1% NaCl solution). We also investigated the effect of adding abalone hydrolysate to the double emulsion as a saltiness enhancer. The cheeses were physico-chemically evaluated to determine curd yield, pH value, moisture content, color, texture, salt release rate, and sensory properties. No significant differences were observed in curd yield, pH value, moisture content, lightness, or redness between the cheeses made with and without the double emulsion. However, in the evaluation of salt release rate, fresh cheese made with double emulsion (W1 = distilled water, W2 = 1% NaCl + 1% abalone hydrolysate) was detected earlier than the control or the other treatments. In the sensory evaluation, fresh cheese made with the double emulsion showed higher scores for saltiness and overall preference than the control or the other treatments. We concluded that abalone hydrolysate encapsulated in a double emulsion (W1 is water and W2 is abalone hydrolysate and NaCl solution) could enhance the saltiness of fresh cheese while maintaining the same salt concentration, without altering its physical properties.",

            "abstract": "Cheese yield is the most important technological parameter in the dairy industry in many countries. The aim of this study was to infer (co)variance components for cheese yields (CY) and nutrient recoveries in curd (REC) predicted using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of samples collected during milk recording on Holstein, Brown Swiss, and Simmental dairy cows. A total of 311,354 FTIR spectra representing the test-day records of 29,208 dairy cows (Holstein, Brown Swiss, and Simmental) from 654 herds, collected over a 3-yr period, were available for the study. The traits of interest for each cow consisted of 3 cheese yield traits (%CY: fresh curd, curd total solids, and curd water as a percent of the weight of the processed milk), 4 curd nutrient recovery traits (REC: fat, protein, total solids, and the energy of the curd as a percent of the same nutrient in the processed milk), and 3 daily cheese production traits (daily fresh curd, total solids, and the water of the curd per cow). Calibration equations (freely available upon request to the corresponding author) were used to predict individual test-day observations for these traits. The (co)variance components were estimated for the CY, REC, milk production, and milk composition traits via a set of 4-trait analyses within each breed. All analyses were performed using REML and linear animal models. The heritabilities of the %CY were always higher for Holstein and Brown Swiss cows (0.22 to 0.33) compared with Simmental cows (0.14 to 0.18). In general, the fresh cheese yield (%CYCURD) showed genetic variation and heritability estimates that were slightly higher than those of its components, %CYSOLIDS and %CYWATER. The parameter RECPROTEIN was the most heritable trait in all the 3 breeds, with values ranging from 0.32 to 0.41. Our estimation of the genetic relationships of the CY and REC with milk production and composition revealed that the current selection strategies used in dairy cattle are expected to exert only limited effects on the REC traits. Instead, breeders may be able to exploit genetic variations in the %CY, particularly RECFAT and RECPROTEIN. This last component is not explained by the milk protein content, suggesting that its direct selection could be beneficial for cheese production aptitude. Collectively, our findings indicate that breeding strategies aimed at enhancing CY and REC could be easily and rapidly implemented for dairy cattle populations in which FTIR spectra are routinely acquired from individual milk samples.",

Fresh raw disk abalone was composed of 29.3% of the shell part, 17.7% of the intestinal part, and 43.9% of the flesh part. and the amount of nutritive substances in the intestinal part were higher those in the flesh part. Arginine was the most abundant amino acid both in raw and drinking extract of disk abalone. Drinking extract prepared with 250 g of the flesh of disk abalone at for 2 hours was better in color and overall taste than those made with 150 g or 200 g of the flesh. As the extracting temperature was gradually increased or the extracting period was gradually extended, the extracting effect was slightly improved but the color of the extract turned out to undesirable one. The desirable sea tangle extract could be made when 15 g of sea tangle was extracted in 1 l of water at for 2 hours, and which was accorded well with the color of drinking abalone extract. From these results the best drinking extract of disk abalone can be manufactured with 250 g of the abalone flesh extracted in 1 l of water at for 2 hours.",

Abalone aquaculture is still a developing industry, and at least two major issues, nutrition and health, impede its development. Abalone are fed macroalgae on-farm in a number of countries, including China, Korea, South Africa and Chile. Formulated diets are crucial to the success of abalone aquaculture in countries where abalone do not grow readily when fed brown macroalgae or when access to macroalgae is insufficient for culture. Typically, the growth rate of abalone fed formulated diets is higher than abalone fed live macroalgae. However, due to a long production period, diets for abalone not only need to sustain high growth rates, but also maintain optimal health. Feeding live macroalgae improves the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone. In this review, the nutritional requirements of abalone and dietary ingredients used in formulated diets will be discussed, together with the use of dried macroalgal meal as a dietary ingredient in formulated diets to improve the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone in commercial production.",

            "abstract": "Multiple emulsions of W 1 /O/W 2 type are of major interest in life sciences, offering possibilities for the encapsulation of water-soluble active agents. In food science, they are also applied for fat reduction. The droplet size distributions of the inner and outer emulsions are of main importance as they influence the rheological and sensorial properties, the release kinetics, as well as the structural and microbial stability. However, the determination of the inner and outer droplet size distributions is a major challenge, as conventional measurement techniques cannot be applied. Pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) is well known as a non-destructive tool for droplet size determination, especially in simple emulsions. In this work, double emulsions of the W 1 /O/W 2 type were prepared with polyglycerol-polyricinoleate (PGPR) and polyoxyethylen-20-sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) as emulsifiers by means of rotor-stator emulsification machines. PFG-NMR was applied for measurements of the inner phase (W 1 ) droplet size distribution as well as for the characterization of the O phase. The W 1 values were compared with results from laser light diffraction of simple emulsions (W 1 /O type) and were found to be consistent within the experimental errors, if restricted diffusion in the outer water phase (W 2 ) and additional effects are considered.",

Sausages were produced containing 5 and 10% ASSPE. Sausages containing ASSPE showed no significant differences in emulsion stability, color, pH, moisture, viable cell count, and VBN compared to the control. The hardness significantly increased with the addition of ASSPE, and sausages containing 5% ASSPE were the highest in gumminess. In the sensory evaluation, sausages containing 5% ASSPE had the highest score in appearance and springiness. In conclusion, the addition of ASSPE in sausage had no effects on storage characteristics, but had a good effect on improvement of quality and sensory characteristics. Especially, 5% ASSPE sausage had good texture and high sensory characteristics due to increased binding capacity. These results suggest that 5% ASSPE may improve the quality and sensory characteristics of sausage.",
