            "abstract": "In the vertebrate taste cell, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved in the transduction of both bitter and sweet taste stimulants. The bitter compound denatonium raises the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in rat taste cells, apparently via G protein-mediated increases in inositol trisphosphate. Sucrose causes a G protein-dependent generation of cAMP in rat taste bud membranes; elevation of cAMP levels leads to taste cell depolarization. To identify and characterize those proteins involved in the taste transduction process, we have cloned G protein alpha subunit (G alpha) cDNAs from rat taste cells. Using degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of G proteins, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify and clone taste cell G alpha cDNAs. Eight distinct G alpha cDNAs were isolated, cloned and sequenced from a taste cell library. Among these clones was alpha gustducin, a novel taste G alpha closely related to the transducins. In addition to alpha gustducin, we cloned rod and cone transducins from taste cells. This is the first identification of transducin expression outside photoreceptor cells. The primary sequence of alpha gustducin shows similarities to the transducins in the receptor interaction domain and the phosphodiesterase activation site. These sequence similarities suggest that gustducin and transducin regulate taste cell phosphodiesterase, probably in bitter taste transduction.",

The enzymatic activity was localized in the apical portion (microvilli and neck) of taste bud cells. Especially strong activity was observed on the microvillous membrane of type I (dark) cells and often on a blunt process of type III cells. The microvilli of type II (light) cells showed weak enzymatic activity. Considering that the apical portion of taste cells is a likely site of interaction between taste stimuli and the cells, the results support the idea that cyclic GMP is involved in taste transduction.",

            "abstract": "1. A variety of chemicals that humans describe as sweet drive neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) of the rat more vigorously when applied to the taste receptors associated with the nasoincisor ducts (NID) than when applied to taste receptors on the anterior tongue (AT). 2. The differential effects of sweet stimuli applied to the AT and NID also are evident in the set of across-neuron correlations produced by these stimuli. The psychophysical similarity among the sweet stimuli is better accounted for by responses to stimulation of the NID than by responses to stimulation of the AT (mean correlation between pairs of sweet stimuli = +0.70 for the NID, +0.44 for the AT). 3. Disaccharides or polysaccharides of glucose, i.e., maltose (0.3 M) and Polycose (0.1 M), are poor stimuli on the NID, evoking responses only 17.8 and 26.7% as great as the response elicited by sucrose (0.3 M), an optimal stimulus for this receptor subpopulation. This suggests that Polycose and maltose interact with receptor sites distinct from those with an affinity for sweet stimuli. Polycose and maltose also are ineffective stimuli on the AT, evoking responses only 11.8 and 4.9% as large as the response evoked by an optimal stimulus for this receptor subpopulation, a mixture of electrolytes (0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M HCl, and 0.01 M quinine HCl). 4. The relative effectiveness of the sweet sugars in driving NST neurons (sucrose greater than fructose greater than glucose) correlates with their order of effectiveness in generating preference behavior in the rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Immunofluorescence for alpha-gustducin was observed in taste cells of both types of papillae and exhibited two patterns of immunofluorescence, plasmalemmal and cytosolic. The plasmalemmal pattern showed intense immunofluorescence localized to the apical region, and was exhibited by most immunoreactive taste cells. In contrast, the cytosolic pattern, observed in one or two immunoreactive cells in a taste bud per section, showed immunofluorescence distributed throughout the cytoplasm. A subpopulation of alpha-gustducin-immunoreactive taste receptor cells, most of which exhibited the cytosolic pattern, also expressed NSE. Optical sectioning, using confocal laser scanning microscopy, demonstrated the highest level of expression of alpha-gustducin in the apical microvillar region of the taste cells in close apposition to the taste pore. These studies indicate conservation of epitopes of alpha-gustducin in humans and rats, and suggest that this G protein is associated with taste transduction in both rats and humans. The patterns of expression of alpha-gustducin, and coexpression with NSE, may correlate with specialized subtypes or developmental stages of taste receptor cells.",

In control membranes derived from either tongue muscle or tongue non-sensory epithelium, the effect of sugars on adenylate cyclase activity was either much smaller or absent. Sucrose enhanced adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-related manner, and this activation was dependent on the presence of guanine nucleotides, suggesting the involvement of a GTP-binding protein ('G-protein'). The activation of adenylate cyclase by various mono- and di-saccharides correlated with their electrophysiological potency. Among non-sugar sweeteners, sodium saccharin activated the enzyme, whereas aspartame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone did not, in correlation with their sweet-taste effectiveness in the rat. Sucrose activation of the enzyme was partly inhibited by Cu2+ and Zn2+, in agreement with their effect on electrophysiological sweet-taste responses. Our results are consistent with a sweet-taste transduction mechanism involving specific receptors, a guanine-nucleotide-binding protein and the cyclic AMP-generating enzyme adenylate cyclase.",

We have determined the murine chromosomal locations of all 15 G alpha subunit genes using an interspecific backcross derived from crosses of C57BL/6J and Mus spretus mice.

            "abstract": "Cells of mammalian taste buds have been classified into morphological types based on ultrastructural criteria, but investigators have disagreed as to whether these are distinct cell types or the extremes of a continuum. To address this issue, we examined taste buds from rat vallate papillae that had been sectioned transversely, rather than longitudinally, to their longest axis. In these transverse sections, dark (Type I) and light (Type II) cells were easily distinguished by their relative electron density, shape and topological relationships. Cells with electron-lucent cytoplasm (light cells) were circular or oval in outline, while those with electron-dense cytoplasm (dark cells) had an irregular outline with sheetlike cytoplasmic projections that separated adjacent light cells. A hierarchical cluster analysis of 314 cells across five morphological parameters (cell shape and area, and nuclear ellipticity, electron density and invagination) revealed two distinct groups of cells, which largely corresponded to the dark and light cells identified visually. These cells were not continuously distributed within a principal components factor solution. Differences in the means for dark and light cells were highly significant for each morphological parameter, but within either cell type, changes in one parameter correlated little with changes in any other. These analyses all failed to reveal cells with a consistent set of intermediate characteristics, suggesting that dark and light cells of rat vallate taste buds are distinct cell types rather than extremes of a continuum. Sections of taste buds were stained with antibodies to several carbohydrates, then observed by indirect immunofluorescence. Optical sections taken with a confocal laser-scanning microscope showed that the Lewis antigen was present only on spindle-shaped cells with circular or oval outlines and lacking transverse projections; these characteristic shapes matched those of light cells seen by electron microscopy. The H blood group antigen and the 2B8 epitope appeared at most cell-cell interfaces in the bud and are present on dark cells and possibly on some light cells. These findings relate molecular markers to morphological phenotypes and should facilitate future studies of taste cell turnover, development and regeneration.",

Members of this subgroup, which have large N-terminal extracellular domains, include receptors that respond specifically to the amino acid glutamate; receptors that respond to the glutamate analogue, gamma-amino butyric acid; and several receptors that act as broad-spectrum amino acid sensors. The CaR is one of these broad-spectrum amino acid sensors that, along with several other members of the subgroup, also responds to extracellular Ca2+. In this mini-review, we consider evidence that the CaR is a sensor of aromatic amino acids, that it has broad-spectrum amino acid sensing properties, that it provides an amino acid binding site in its extracellular N-terminal Venus Fly Trap domain, and that amino acids have a physiological impact on systems in which the CaR is expressed.",

            "abstract": "The cloning of a G protein-coupled extracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(o)(2+))-sensing receptor (CaR) has elucidated the molecular basis for many of the previously recognized effects of Ca(o)(2+) on tissues that maintain systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, especially parathyroid chief cells and several cells in the kidney. The availability of the cloned CaR enabled the development of DNA and antibody probes for identifying the CaR's mRNA and protein, respectively, within these and other tissues. It also permitted the identification of human diseases resulting from inactivating or activating mutations of the CaR gene and the subsequent generation of mice with targeted disruption of the CaR gene. The characteristic alterations in parathyroid and renal function in these patients and in the mice with \"knockout\" of the CaR gene have provided valuable information on the CaR's physiological roles in these tissues participating in mineral ion homeostasis. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about how the CaR regulates other tissues involved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, particularly bone and intestine. Moreover, there is evidence that additional Ca(o)(2+) sensors may exist in bone cells that mediate some or even all of the known effects of Ca(o)(2+) on these cells. Even more remains to be learned about the CaR's function in the rapidly growing list of cells that express it but are uninvolved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) metabolism. Available data suggest that the receptor serves numerous roles outside of systemic mineral ion homeostasis, ranging from the regulation of hormonal secretion and the activities of various ion channels to the longer term control of gene expression, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and cellular proliferation. In some cases, the CaR on these \"nonhomeostatic\" cells responds to local changes in Ca(o)(2+) taking place within compartments of the extracellular fluid (ECF) that communicate with the outside environment (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract). In others, localized changes in Ca(o)(2+) within the ECF can originate from several mechanisms, including fluxes of calcium ions into or out of cellular or extracellular stores or across epithelium that absorb or secrete Ca(2+). In any event, the CaR and other receptors/sensors for Ca(o)(2+) and probably for other extracellular ions represent versatile regulators of numerous cellular functions and may serve as important therapeutic targets.",

(2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 4814-4819). However, the domain-based location of amino acid binding has been uncertain. We now show that the Venus Fly Trap (VFT) domain of CaR, but none of its other major domains, is required for amino acid sensing. Several constructs were informative when expressed in HEK293 cells. First, the wild-type CaR exhibited allosteric activation by L-amino acids as previously observed. Second, two CaR-mGlu chimeric receptor constructs that retained the VFT domain of CaR, one containing the extracellular Cys-rich region of CaR and the other containing the Cys-rich region of the rat metabotropic glutamate type-1 (mGlu-1) receptor, together with the rat mGlu-1 transmembrane region and C-terminal tail, retained amino acid sensing. Third, a CaR lacking residues 1-599 of the N-terminal extracellular head but retaining an intact CaR transmembrane region and a functional but truncated C terminus (headless-T903 CaR) failed to respond to L-amino acids but retained responsiveness to the type-II calcimimetic NPS R-467. Finally, a T903 CaR control that retained an intact N terminus also retained L-amino acid sensing. Taken together, the data indicate that the VFT domain of CaR is necessary for L-amino acid sensing and are consistent with the hypothesis that the VFT domain is the site of L-amino acid binding. The findings support the concept that the mGlu-1 amino acid binding site for L-glutamate is conserved as an L-amino acid binding site in its homolog, the CaR.",

The goal of this study was to compare behavioral responses of B6 and 129 mice to a wider variety of sweeteners. Seventeen sweeteners were tested using two-bottle preference tests with water. Three main patterns of strain differences were evident. First, sucrose, maltose, saccharin, acesulfame-K, sucralose and SC-45647 were preferred by both strains, but the B6 mice had lower preference thresholds and higher solution intakes. Second, the amino acids D-phenylalanine, D-tryptophan, L-proline and glycine were highly preferred by B6 mice, but not by 129 mice. Third, glycyrrhizic acid, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, thaumatin and cyclamate did not evoke strong preferences in either strain. Aspartame was neutral to all 129 and some B6 mice, but other B6 mice strongly preferred it. Thus, compared with the 129 mice the B6 mice had higher preferences for sugars, sweet tasting amino acids and several but not all non-caloric sweeteners. Glycyrrhizic acid, neohesperidin, thaumatin and cyclamate are not palatable to B6 or 129 mice.",

This is interpreted to mean that there is only one sweetness receptor, although an alternative explanation in terms of variation in psychological motivation is not discounted. The difference between C57BL/6Ty and DBA/2Ty is largely due to a single gene, Sac.",

        "abstract": "Renovascular hypertension is characterized by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, blunted natriuretic responses, and elevated sympathetic nerve activity. Excess dietary salt intake exaggerates arterial blood pressure (ABP) in multiple models of experimental hypertension. The present study tested whether a high-salt diet exaggerated ABP and vascular dysfunction in a 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) murine model. Male C57BL/6J mice (8–12 wk) were randomly assigned, and fed a 0.1% or 4.0% NaCl diet, and instrumented with telemetry units to measure ABP. Then, the 2K1C model was produced by placing a cuff around the right renal artery. Systolic, diastolic, and mean ABP were significantly higher in mice fed 4.0% vs. 0.1% NaCl at 1 wk but not after 3 wk. Interestingly, 2K1C hypertension progressively increased arterial pulse pressure in both groups; however, the magnitude was significantly greater in mice fed 4.0% vs. 0.1% NaCl at 3 wk. Moreover, pulse wave velocity was significantly greater in 2K1C mice fed 4.0% vs. 0.1% NaCl diet or sham-operated mice fed either diet. Histological assessment of aortas indicated no structural differences among groups. Finally, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was significantly and selectively attenuated in the aorta but not mesenteric arteries of 2K1C mice fed 4.0% NaCl vs. 0.1% NaCl or sham-operated control mice. The findings suggest that dietary salt loading transiently exaggerates 2K1C renovascular hypertension but promotes chronic aortic stiffness and selective aortic vascular dysfunction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY High dietary salt exaggerates hypertension in multiple experimental models. Here we demonstrate that a high-salt diet produces a greater increase in arterial blood pressure at 1 wk after induction of 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) hypertension but not at 3 wk. Interestingly, 2K1C mice fed a high-salt diet displayed an exaggerated pulse pressure, elevated pulse wave velocity, and reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the aorta but not mesenteric arteries. These findings suggest that dietary salt may interact with underlying cardiovascular disease to promote selective vascular dysfunction and aortic stiffness.",

In this study, we used 3 independent assays to determine whether such a small increase in sodium concentrations per se alters endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function and contributes to hypertension. By directly measuring NOS activity in living bovine aortic endothelial cells, we demonstrated that a 5-mmol/L increase in salt concentration (from 137 to 142 mmol/L) caused a 25% decrease in NOS activity. Importantly, the decrease in NOS activity was in a salt concentration-dependent manner. The NOS activity was decreased by 25, 45, and 70%, with the increase of 5, 10, and 20 mmol/L of NaCl, respectively. Using Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing eNOS, we confirmed the inhibitory effects of salt on eNOS activity. The eNOS activity was unaffected in the presence of equal milliosmol of mannitol, which excludes an osmotic effect. Using an ex vivo aortic angiogenesis assay, we demonstrated that salt attenuated the nitric oxide (NO)-dependent proliferation of endothelial cells. By directly monitoring blood pressure changes in response to salt infusion, we found that in vivo infusion of salt induced an acute increase in blood pressure in a salt concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that eNOS is sensitive to changes in salt concentration. A 5-mmol/L rise in salt concentration, within the range observed in essential hypertension patients or in individuals with high salt intake, could significantly suppress eNOS activity. This salt-induced reduction in NO generation in endothelial cells may contribute to the development of hypertension.",

Because previous results have been inconclusive, we investigated whether renovascular hypertensives show increased total and regional sympathetic nerve activity.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nSixty-five patients underwent renal angiography and measurements of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II in conjunction with estimation of sympathetic nerve activity by means of radiotracer dilution and intraneural recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Age-matched healthy subjects (n=15) were examined for comparison. Total body norepinephrine (NE) spillover, an index of overall sympathetic nerve activity, was increased by 100% and MSNA by 60% in the hypertensive patients compared with healthy subjects (P<0.01 for both). A subgroup of 24 patients with well-defined renovascular hypertension (cured or improved hypertension after renal angioplasty) showed similar increases in total body NE spillover compared with the group at large. Patients with arterial plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels above median had higher values for total body NE spillover than patients below median (P<0.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study unequivocally demonstrates elevated sympathetic nerve activity in patients with renovascular hypertension. The adrenergic overactivity may contribute to the blood pressure elevation and perhaps also to the high cardiovascular mortality in renovascular hypertension.",

These observations suggest that subtle links might associate arterial stiffness and kidney function in normotensive and hypertensive populations. Recently, aortic pulse wave velocity and creatinine clearance have been shown to be statistically associated in subjects with plasma creatinine < or =130 micromol/L, again independently of mean arterial blood pressure and classical cardiovascular risk factors. This association was even shown to predominate in subjects younger than age 55 years. In addition, acceleration of aortic pulse wave velocity with age was more important in these subjects than in untreated normotensive control individuals, and the phenomenon was consistently predicted by baseline plasma creatinine values. Among all antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors only were shown to exhibit a significant and independent effect on aortic stiffness. The use of these drugs was significantly associated with improvement of large aortic stiffness in subjects treated for hypertension. In conclusion, increased stiffness of central arteries is independently associated with reduced creatinine clearance in subjects with mild to severe renal insufficiency, indicating that kidney diseases may interact not only with small but also with large conduit arteries, independently of age, blood pressure level, and classical cardiovascular risk factors. Whether sodium, divalent ionic species (calcium, phosphates), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system play a role in such alterations remains to be elucidated.",

We propose that if renal sympathetic activity is a factor in the development of DOCA-salt hypertension, then renal denervation (RDNX) should attenuate the hypertensive response. In protocol 1, uninephrectomized RDNX (n = 9) and sham-denervated (n = 6) Sprague-Dawley rats were allowed free access to 0.9% NaCl solution and 0.1% NaCl diet. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate were telemetrically recorded for 4 days before and 36 days after DOCA (100 mg/rat) implantation; sodium and water balances were recorded daily. Protocol 2 was similar except that saline intake in sham rats (n = 7) was matched to that observed in RDNX rats of protocol 1 for 30 days; for the last 10 days, the rats were allowed free access to saline. Before DOCA in protocol 1, MAP was lower (P < 0.05) in RDNX rats (99 +/- 1 mmHg) compared with sham rats (111 +/- 3 mmHg); however, heart rate and sodium and water balances were similar between groups. RDNX attenuated the MAP response to DOCA by approximately 50% (DeltaMAP = 22 +/- 3 mmHg, where Delta is change in MAP) when compared with sham rats (DeltaMAP = 38 +/- 6). RDNX rats consumed significantly less saline than sham rats, and cumulative sodium and water balances were reduced by 33% and 23%, respectively. In protocol 2, a similar pattern in MAP elevation was observed in RDNX and saline-restricted, sham-denervated rats even when saline restriction was removed. These results indicate that the renal sympathetic nerves are important in hypertension development but that other factors are also involved.",

We evaluated whether a high level of resistance to flow in the segmental arteries of both kidneys (indicated by resistance-index values of at least 80) can be used prospectively to select appropriate patients for treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe evaluated 5950 patients with hypertension for renal-artery stenosis using color Doppler ultrasonography, and we measured the resistance index ([1 - end-diastolic velocity divided by maximal systolic velocity] x 100). Among 138 patients who had unilateral or bilateral renal-artery stenosis of more than 50 percent of the luminal diameter and who underwent renal angioplasty or surgery, the procedure was technically successful in 131 (95 percent). Creatinine clearance and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were measured before renal-artery stenosis was corrected; 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure; and yearly thereafter. The mean (+/-SD) duration of follow-up was 32+/-21 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 35 patients (27 percent) who had resistance-index values of at least 80 before revascularization, the mean arterial pressure did not decrease by 10 mm Hg or more after revascularization in 34 (97 percent). Renal function declined (defined by a decrease in the creatinine clearance; of at least 10 percent) in 28 (80 percent); 16 (46 percent) became dependent on dialysis and 10 (29 percent) died during follow-up. Among the 96 patients (73 percent) with a resistance-index value of less than 80, the mean arterial pressure decreased by at least 10 percent in all but 6 patients (6 percent) after revascularization; renal function worsened in only 3 (3 percent), all of whom became dependent on dialysis; and 3 (3 percent) died (P<0.001 for the comparison with patients with a resistance-index value of at least 80).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA renal resistance-index value of at least 80 reliably identifies patients with renal-artery stenosis in whom angioplasty or surgery will not improve renal function, blood pressure, or kidney survival.",

Blood pressure, renin concentration and angiotensin II were measured in unanaesthetized two-kidney one-clip hypertensive rats at 1 and 2 days, at weekly intervals up to 10 weeks and at 15 and 20 weeks after clipping. 2. Compared with values in sham-operated rats, renin and angiotensin II were initially increased at 1-2 days but were then suppressed between 2 and 4 weeks to levels similar to that found in sham-operated rats. Between 5 and 20 weeks renin and angiotensin II increased again to high levels. 3. There was a significant correlation between angiotensin II and blood pressure in acute rats 1-2 days after clipping (P less than 0.05) and in chronic rats 8-20 weeks after clipping (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in the slope of the regression lines but the regression line for the chronic rats was shifted upwards in a parallel manner. 4. The acute hypotensive response (-20.3 +/- SD 24.9 mmHg) in 26 chronic rats given converting enzyme inhibitor was related to the basal renin and angiotensin II levels and followed the slope of the angiotensin II/blood pressure regression line for all chronic rats. Only one out of 26 rats reduced its blood pressure to normal levels. 5. In 12 rats at 4 weeks after clipping, when blood pressure was elevated but angiotensin II was suppressed, there was only a small fall in blood pressure (-7.1 +/- SD 7.2 mmHg). This also followed the angiotensin II/blood pressure regression line for chronic rats but at the lower end. Blood pressure again was not reduced to normal. 6. These results suggest that renin and angiotensin II are increased up to 20 weeks after clipping, that there is no change in the net vascular responsiveness to endogenous angiotensin II at any stage in this experimental model and that the acute effect of angiotensin II is determined solely by its position in the same dose-response curve. Also with the exception of 1-2 days immediately after clipping the acute effect of angiotensin II plays only a minor, though variable, role in the hypertension and that some other mechanism, as yet undetermined, is of greater importance and begins to have an effect as early as 2 weeks after clipping.",

In the deoxycorticosterone acetate - salt (DOCA-NaCl) hypertensive rat and the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) of the Okamoto strain, total peripheral renal denervation delays the development and blunts the severity of hypertension and causes an increase in urinary sodium excretion, suggesting a renal efferent mechanism. Further, selective lesioning of the renal afferent nerves by dorsal rhizotomy reduces hypothalamic norepinephrine stores without altering the development of hypertension in the SHR, indicating that the renal afferent nerves do not play a major role in the development of hypertension in this genetic model. In contrast, the renal afferent nerves appear to be important in one-kidney, one-clip and two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats (1K, 1C and 2K, 1C, respectively) and in dogs with chronic coarctation hypertension. Total peripheral renal denervation attenuates the severity of hypertension in these models, mainly by interrupting renal afferent nerve activity, which by a direct feedback mechanism attenuates systemic sympathetic tone, thereby lowering blood pressure. Peripheral renal denervation has a peripheral sympatholytic effect and alters the level of activation of central noradrenergic pathways but does not alter sodium or water intake or excretion, plasma renin activity or creatinine clearance, suggesting that efferent renal nerve function does not play an important role in the maintenance of this form of hypertension. Selective lesioning of the renal afferent nerves attenuates the development of hypertension, thus giving direct evidence that the renal afferent nerves participate in the pathogenesis of renovascular hypertension.",

First, electrical stimulation of mouse renal afferent nerves produced frequency-dependent increases in ABP that were eliminated by ganglionic blockade. Stimulus-triggered averaging revealed renal afferent stimulation significantly increased splanchnic, renal, and lumbar SNA. Second, kidney injection of wheat germ agglutinin into male C57Bl6 mice (12-14 weeks, Jackson Laboratories) produced ipsilateral labeling in the T11-L2 dorsal root ganglia. Next, 2K1C hypertension was produced in male C57Bl6 mice (12-14 weeks, Jackson Laboratories) by placement of a 0.5mm length of PTFE tubing around the left renal artery. 2K1C mice displayed an elevated ABP measured via telemetry and greater fall in mean ABP to ganglionic blockade at day 14 or 21 vs day 0. Renal afferent discharge was significantly higher in 2K1C-clipped versus 2K1C-unclipped or sham kidneys. In addition, 2K1C-clipped versus 2K1C-unclipped or sham kidneys had lower renal mass and higher mRNA levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, both ipsilateral renal denervation (10% phenol) or selective denervation of renal afferent nerves (periaxonal application of 33 mM capsaicin) at time of clipping resulted in lower ABP of 2K1C mice at Days 14 or 21. These findings suggest mouse renal sensory neurons are activated to increase SNA and ABP in 2K1C hypertension.",

            "abstract": "Enzymes from extremophilic microorganisms usually catalyze chemical reactions in non-standard conditions. Such conditions promote aggregation, precipitation, and denaturation, reducing the activity of most non-extremophilic enzymes, frequently due to the absence of sufficient hydration. Some extremophilic enzymes maintain a tight hydration shell and remain active in solution even when liquid water is limiting, e.g. in the presence of high ionic concentrations, or at cold temperature when water is close to the freezing point. Extremophilic enzymes are able to compete for hydration via alterations especially to their surface through greater surface charges and increased molecular motion. These properties have enabled some extremophilic enzymes to function in the presence of non-aqueous organic solvents, with potential for design of useful catalysts. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge of extremophilic enzymes functioning in high salinity and cold temperatures, focusing on their strategy for function at low water activity. We discuss how the understanding of extremophilic enzyme function is leading to the design of a new generation of enzyme catalysts and their applications to biotechnology.",

The isozymic systems which were reviewed include DNA polymerase, hexokinase-glucokinase, fructose 1,6-diphosphatase, aldolase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, glutaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, adenylate kinase, carbamylphosphate synthetase, and lactose synthetase. The basic isozymic system was outlined, and alterations which occurred in the neoplastic state were discussed in terms of the postulated role for that particular isozymic system in cellular metabolism.",

An experimental study was carried out to isolate the L glutaminase producing actinomycetes from the marine sediment of Thoothukudi. Marine sediment samples were collected from six different locations of the Thoothukudi coastal ecosystem, enriched with glutamine broth to enhance the population of Actinomycetes. After enrichment, selective media were used for isolating the Actinomycetes. Ninety four isolate was obtained and all the isolates were screened for L Glutaminase activity in a rapid plate assay method. Three isolates showed strong activity with enzyme production to the level of 9.42 IU to 16.94 IU /ml. The isolate DSG 18 had produced 16.94± 0.62 IU and it could be used a good source of glutaminase.",

It is currently used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Another potential application of L-glutaminase is as flavor enhancing agent in soy sauce fermentation. Even though L-glutaminase activity was reported in numerous micro-organisms, production of L-glutaminase from marine bacteria is very scanty. With this view, in the present research work, L-glutaminase production pattern was studied under submerged fermentation using novel marine isolate Vibrio azureus strain JK-79 (GenBank Acession Number JQ820323) based on one-factor-at-a-time approach. The maximum yield of enzyme production (247 U/ml) was achieved in a seawater based medium at pH 8, 37°C, 1% inoculum concentration and 2% glutamine concentration for 24 h. The medium when supplemented with carbon source, it improved the enzyme production from 247 to 321 U/ml with 1.5% maltose. Addition of 2% soybean meal also improved the L-glutaminase production (289 U/ml). The above results indicate the scope for production of salt tolerant L-glutaminase using this novel marine bacterial strain.

This review focuses on the production of various industrial enzymes by SSF processes. Following a brief discussion of the micro-organisms and the substrates used in SSF systems, and aspects of the design of fermenter and the factors affecting production of enzymes, an illustrative survey is presented on various individual groups of enzymes such as cellulolytic, pectinolytic, ligninolytic, amylolytic and lipolytic enzymes, etc.",

Hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and ammonia is catalysed by L-glutaminase enzyme. It is used against cancer and also enhances flavour in a variety of fermented foods. Primary screening followed by secondary screening was done to identify the isolate showing highest L-glutaminase production. Further, different antioxidant assays like (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) DPPH, metal chelating, reducing power were done to test the antioxidant activity of L-glutaminase producing isolate. Further the haemolytic activity of the isolate was performed. Strain BSAIP5 showed highest enzyme activity (1.77 IU/ml) as compared to the other isolates. Hence, this isolate was selected for further assays. BSAIP5 showed high antioxidant activity. For DPPH assay the scavenging activity was 70.25%, for metal chelating assay the result obtained was 1.07 and for reducing power the result obtained were 0.87.",

In this study, the extracellular L-glutaminase produced by Bacillus subtilis strain JK-79 was purified to homogeneity. The purified L-glutaminase has specific activity of 937 U mg−1 with KM and VMax value of 8 × 10-2 mM and 200 µM/ml min, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) confirmed it to have a molecular mass of 64 kDa. Further biochemical characterization revealed that the purified enzyme attained maximal activity at pH 7 and temperature 37°C. The enzyme was stable at 37°C for 60 min at physiologic-ph. The enzyme showed high specificity towards L-glutamine. The effect of metal ions on enzyme activity showed that NaCl, KCl and CaCl2 enhanced the activity while AgCl3 and CuCl2 strongly inhibited the activity of the enzyme. The in-vitro antioxidant activity of the enzyme was investigated and the IC50 value for DPPH and ABTS assay were 400 and 600 µg/ml, respectively. The purified enzyme showed cytotoxic activity against various Leukemic cell lines tested with IC50 value of 231, 480, and 500 µg/ml for K562, U932 and Jurkat cell lines, respectively. Interestingly, L-glutaminase also revealed cytotoxic effect on other cancer cell lines such as MCF-7, OV1063 and HCA 7 with IC50 value of 500, 526 and 750 µg/ml, respectively. Hence this enzyme from marine bacteria would possibly be an attractive candidate for further pharmaceutical use as a broad spectrum anti-tumor drug. \n \n   \n \n Key words: L-glutaminase, purification, characterization, anti-oxidant activity, anti-cancer activity.",

Here we show, using the comprehensive measurement of metabolic enzymes by large-scale targeted proteomics, that the metabolism both carbon and nitrogen is altered during the malignant progression of cancer. The fate of glutamine nitrogen is shifted from the anaplerotic pathway into the TCA cycle to nucleotide biosynthesis, with this shift being controlled by glutaminase (GLS1) and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT). Interventions to reduce the PPAT/GLS1 ratio suppresses tumor growth of many types of cancer. A meta-analysis reveals that PPAT shows the strongest correlation with malignancy among all metabolic enzymes, in particular in neuroendocrine cancer including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). PPAT depletion suppresses the growth of SCLC lines. A shift in glutamine fate may thus be required for malignant progression of cancer, with modulation of nitrogen metabolism being a potential approach to SCLC treatment. Glucose metabolism is known to be dysregulated in cancer. Here, the authors show that glutamine nitrogen is also affected in cancer and demonstrate that glutaminase 1 and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase are the key enzymes that control this metabolic switch.",

The marine bacterium, Halomonas meridian was isolated from the Red Sea and selected as the more active L-glutaminase-producing bacteria. L-glutaminase fermentation was optimized at 36 h, pH 8.0, 37 °C, and 3.0% NaCl, using glucose at 1.5% and soybean meal at 2%. The purified enzyme showed a specific activity of 36.08 U/mg, and the molecular weight was found to be 57 kDa by the SDS-PAGE analysis. The enzyme was highly active at pH 8.0 and 37 °C. The kinetics’ parameters of Km and Vmax were 12.2 × 10−6 M and 121.95 μmol/mL/min, respectively, which reflects a higher affinity for its substrate. The anticancer efficiency of the enzyme showed significant toxic activity toward colorectal adenocarcinoma cells; LS 174 T (IC50 7.0 μg/mL) and HCT 116 (IC50 13.2 μg/mL). A higher incidence of cell death was observed with early apoptosis in HCT 116 than in LS 174 T, whereas late apoptosis was observed in LS 174 T more than in HCT 116. Also, the L-glutaminase induction nuclear fragmentation in HCT 116 was more than that in the LS 174T cells. This is the first report on Halomonas meridiana as an L-glutaminase producer that is used as an anti-colorectal cancer agent.",

The medicinal properties are found in various cellular components and secondary metabolites (polysaccharides, proteins and their complexes, phenolic compounds, polyketides, triterpenoids, steroids, alkaloids, nucleotides, etc.), which have been isolated and identified from the fruiting bodies, culture mycelium, and culture broth of mushrooms. Some of these compounds have cholesterol-lowering, anti-diabetic, antioxidant, antitumor, immunomodulating, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities ready for industrial trials and further commercialization, while others are in various stages of development. Recently, the submerged cultivation of medicinal mushrooms has received a great deal of attention as a promising and reproducible alternative for the efficient production of mushroom mycelium and metabolites. Submerged cultivation of mushrooms has significant industrial potential, but its success on a commercial scale depends on increasing product yields and development of novel production systems that address the problems associated with this technique of mushroom cultivation. In spite of many researchers' efforts for the production of bioactive metabolites by mushrooms, the physiological and engineering aspects of submerged cultures are still far from being thoroughly studied. The vast majority of studies have focused on polysaccharide and ganoderic acid production in submerged cultivation of medicinal mushrooms, and very little has been written so far on the antioxidant and hemagglutinating activity of submerged mushroom cultures. The purpose of this review is to provide an update of the present state of the art and future prospects of submerged cultivation of medicinal mushrooms to produce mycelium and bioactive metabolites, and to make a contribution for the research and development of new pharmaceutical products from mushrooms. A brief overview of the metabolic diversity and bioactive compounds of mushrooms produced by submerged cultures is also given.",

Knowledge of their chemical composition, nutritional value and health-promoting effects has expanded dynamically during the last few years. Dry matter (DM) is low: commonly about 100 g kg⁻¹ . The usual contents of protein, lipids and ash are 200-250, 20-30 and 80-120 g kg⁻¹ DM, respectively. Various carbohydrates form the remaining DM. Nevertheless, great variations occur both among and within species. Energy is low, usually 350-400 kcal kg⁻¹ of fresh fruit bodies. The nutritional contribution of mushroom protein derived from earlier data seems to be overestimated. Fat content is low with markedly prevailing in linoleic acid and oleic acid, while the proportion of n-3 fatty acids is nutritionally marginal. The main carbohydrates are chitin, glycogen, trehalose and mannitol. Information on fibre content and composition is limited. Health-promoting β-glucans are an auspicious group of polysaccharides. High potassium content is characteristic of mushrooms. Several species can accumulate very high levels of both detrimental trace elements, particularly cadmium and mercury, and radiocaesium isotopes if growing on heavily polluted substrates. Mushrooms seem to be a considerable source of ergosterol, provitamin D₂, and phenolids with antioxidative properties. Hundreds of flavour constituents have been identified, particularly with eight-carbon aliphatic chains. Data on changes of mushroom components under various preservation conditions and culinary treatments have been fragmentary. Even more limited is knowledge of nutrient bioavailability.",

Recently, a number of substances of mushroom origin have been isolated, identified and shown to have physiological activities, such as antitumor, immunomodulating, cardiovascular, antihypercholesterolemia, antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, hepatoprotective, and antidiabetic activities. Currently, commercial products from medicinal mushrooms are mostly obtained through the field-cultivation of the fruiting body. However, in this case it is difficult to control the quality of the final product. Submerged fermentation of the mycelial form of mushroom-producing fungi has received much attention as a promising alternative for efficient production of the biomass of medicinal mushrooms and their active metabolites. However, in order for the production to be successful at industrial scale, various technical problems need to be solved, including characterization of the variations that occur during the submerged cultivation of mushrooms in bioreactors and their effects on growth and product formation. This review outlines the major factors that affect the submerged cultivation of mushrooms in bioreactors, including oxygen supply, shear and mixing, morphology and rheology, as well as two-stage cultivation strategies and high-cell-density cultivation strategies such as fed-batch fermentation.",

            "abstract": "The submerged cultivation of edible and medicinal mushrooms is a novel biotechnological process to get nutritive mushroom biomass that can be used for food supplement production. The main aim of this research was focused on the establishment of the best biotechnology of leading and controlling the submerged fermentation organic agricultural wastes by using three edible and medicinal mushroom species Ganoderma lucidum (Curt. Fr.) P. Karst, Lentinula edodes (Berkeley) Pegler and Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacquin ex Fries) Kummer. These mushrooms were cultivated on liquid substrata containing as main constituents different sorts of grain by-products as well as winery wastes. The experiments were carried out by cultivating these mushrooms under controlled conditions inside the culture vessel of a modern laboratory-scale bioreactor designed at the highest biotechnological standards. The submerged fermentation was set up in the following conditions: temperature, 25-27° C; agitation speed, 100-120 rev. min -1; pH level, 5.7–6.5 units; dissolved oxygen tension within the range of 30%-50%. During the period of controlled submerged fermentation lasting from 120 to 170 h, the mycelial biomass of fungal pellets was developed inside the broth. At the end of the culture cycles, the fungal pellets were harvested by extracting them from the culture vessel of the bioreactor and separating them from the broth by slow vacuum filtration. Pellet size, the hairy length of pellets, and the free mycelia fraction in the total biomass were microscopically investigated and the chemical composition of fungal biomass was analysed to determine and compare the protein and reduced sugar contents.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundTaste receptor cells are responsible for transducing chemical stimuli into electrical signals that lead to the sense of taste. An important second messenger in taste transduction is IP3, which is involved in both bitter and sweet transduction pathways. Several components of the bitter transduction pathway have been identified, including the T2R/TRB taste receptors, phospholipase C β2, and the G protein subunits α-gustducin, β3, and γ13. However, the identity of the IP3 receptor subtype in this pathway is not known. In the present study we used immunocytochemistry on rodent taste tissue to identify the IP3 receptors expressed in taste cells and to examine taste bud expression patterns for IP3R3.ResultsAntibodies against Type I, II, and III IP3 receptors were tested on sections of rat and mouse circumvallate papillae. Robust cytoplasmic labeling for the Type III IP3 receptor (IP3R3) was found in a large subset of taste cells in both species. In contrast, little or no immunoreactivity was seen with antibodies against the Type I or Type II IP3 receptors. To investigate the potential role of IP3R3 in bitter taste transduction, we used double-label immunocytochemistry to determine whether IP3R3 is expressed in the same subset of cells expressing other bitter signaling components. IP3R3 immunoreactive taste cells were also immunoreactive for PLCβ2 and γ13. Alpha-gustducin immunoreactivity was present in a subset of IP3R3, PLCβ2, and γ13 positive cells.ConclusionsIP3R3 is the dominant form of the IP3 receptor expressed in taste cells and our data suggest it plays an important role in bitter taste transduction.",

Recent molecular studies suggest that glutamate receptors similar to those in brain are present in taste cells, but their precise role in taste transduction remains to be elucidated. We used giga-seal whole cell recording to examine the effects of MSG and glutamate receptor agonists on membrane properties of taste cells from rat fungiform papillae. MSG (1 mM) induced three subsets of responses in cells voltage-clamped at -80 mV: a decrease in holding current (subset I), an increase in holding current (subset II), and a biphasic response consisting of an increase, followed by a decrease in holding current (subset III). Most subset II glutamate responses were mimicked by the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The current was potentiated by glycine and was suppressed by the NMDA receptor antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5). The group III metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) usually mimicked the subset I glutamate response. This hyperpolarizing response was suppressed by the mGluR antagonist (RS)-alpha-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG) and by 8-bromo-cAMP, suggesting a role for cAMP in the transduction pathway. In a small subset of taste cells, L-AP4 elicited an increase in holding current, resulting in taste cell depolarization under current clamp. Taken together, our results suggest that NMDA-like receptors and at least two types of group III mGluRs are present in taste receptor cells, and these may be coactivated by MSG. Further studies are required to determine which receptors are located on the apical membrane and how they contribute to the umami taste.",

            "abstract": "Receptor proteins for photoreception have been studied for several decades. More recently, putative receptors for olfaction have been isolated and characterized. In contrast, no receptors for taste have been identified yet by molecular cloning. This report describes experiments aimed at identifying a receptor responsible for the taste of monosodium glutamate (MSG). Using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, we found that several ionotropic glutamate receptors are present in rat lingual tissues. However, these receptors also could be detected in lingual tissue devoid of taste buds. On the other hand, RT-PCR and RNase protection assays indicated that a G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR4, also is expressed in lingual tissues and is limited only to taste buds. In situ hybridization demonstrated that mGluR4 is detectable in 40–70% of vallate and foliate taste buds but not in surrounding nonsensory epithelium, confirming the localization of this metabotropic receptor to gustatory cells. Expression of mGluR4 in taste buds is higher in preweaning rats compared with adult rats. This may correspond to the known higher sensitivity to the taste of MSG in juvenile rodents. Finally, behavioral studies have indicated that MSG andl-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (l-AP4), a ligand for mGluR4, elicit similar tastes in rats. We conclude that mGluR4 may be a chemosensory receptor responsible, in part, for the taste of MSG.",

            "abstract": "The neurotransmitters at synapses in taste buds are not yet known with confidence. Here we report a new calcium-imaging technique for taste buds that allowed us to test for the presence of glutamate receptors (GluRs) in living isolated tissue preparations. Taste cells of rat foliate papillae were loaded with calcium green dextran (CaGD). Lingual slices containing CaGD-labeled taste cells were imaged with a scanning confocal microscope and superfused with glutamate (30 μm to 1 mm), kainate (30 and 100 μm), AMPA (30 and 100 μm), or NMDA (100 μm). Responses were observed in 26% of the cells that were tested with 300 μm glutamate. Responses to glutamate were localized to the basal processes and cell bodies, which are synaptic regions of taste cells. Glutamate responses were dose-dependent and were induced by concentrations as low as 30 μm. The non-NMDA receptor antagonists CNQX and GYKI 52466 reversibly blocked responses to glutamate. Kainate, but not AMPA, also elicited Ca2+ responses. NMDA stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i when the bath medium was modified to optimize for NMDA receptor activation. The subset of cells that responded to glutamate was either NMDA-unresponsive (54%) or NMDA-responsive (46%), suggesting that there are presumably two populations of glutamate-sensitive taste cells—one with NMDA receptors and the other without NMDA receptors. The function of GluRs in taste buds is not yet known, but the data suggest that glutamate is a neurotransmitter there. GluRs in taste cells might be presynaptic autoreceptors or postsynaptic receptors at afferent or efferent synapses.",

Human taste perception may be categorized according to four well-known and widely accepted descriptors, sweet, bitter, salty and sour (corresponding to particular taste qualities or modalities), and two more controversial qualities: fat and amino acid taste. The ability to identify sweet-tasting foodstuffs is particularly important as it provides us and other vertebrates with a means to seek out needed carbohydrates with high nutritive value. The perception of bitter, on the other hand, is essential for its protective value, enabling humans to avoid potentially deadly plant alkaloids and other environmental toxins. The focus of this review is on recent advances in our understanding of the transduction elements and signaling mechanisms underlying bitter and sweet taste transduction (see Figure 1). The sensations of bitter and sweet tastes are initiated by the interaction of sapid molecules ('tastants') with G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the apical membranes of taste receptor cells (TRCs). TRCs are specialized epithelial cells with many neuronal properties including the ability to depolarize and form synapses. TRCs are typically clustered in groups of ~100 within taste buds. The apical surface of TRCs, which makes contact with the oral cavity, is rich in convoluted microvilli containing GPCRs, ion channels and other transduction elements. The basolateral aspect of TRCs contains ion channels and synapses with afferent taste nerves.",

The obese diabetic db/db mouse, which has defects in leptin receptor, displays enhanced neural responses and elevated behavioral preference to sweet stimuli. Here, we show the effects of leptin on the peripheral taste system. An administration of leptin into lean mice suppressed responses of peripheral taste nerves (chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal) to sweet substances (sucrose and saccharin) without affecting responses to sour, salty, and bitter substances. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of activities of taste receptor cells isolated from circumvallate papillae (innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve) demonstrated that leptin activated outward K(+) currents, which resulted in hyperpolarization of taste cells. The db/db mouse with impaired leptin receptors showed no such leptin suppression. Taste tissue (circumvallate papilla) of lean mice expressed leptin-receptor mRNA and some of the taste cells exhibited immunoreactivities to antibodies of the leptin receptor. Taken together, these observations suggest that the taste organ is a peripheral target for leptin, and that leptin may be a sweet-sensing modulator (suppressor) that may take part in regulation of food intake. Defects in this leptin suppression system in db/db mice may lead to their enhanced peripheral neural responses and enhanced behavioral preferences for sweet substances.",

When stimulated, these cells produce action potentials that result in the release of neurotransmitter onto an afferent nerve fiber that in turn relays the identity and intensity of the gustatory stimuli to the brain. A variety of mechanisms are used in transducing the four primary tastes. Direct interaction of the stimuli with ion channels appears to be of particular importance in transducing stimuli reported as salty or sour, whereas the second messenger systems cyclic AMP and inositol trisphosphate are important in transducing bitter and sweet stimuli. In addition to the four basic tastes, specific mechanisms exist for the amino acid glutamate, which is sometimes termed the fifth primary taste, and for fatty acids, a so-called nonconventional taste stimulus. The emerging picture is that not only do individual taste qualities use more than one mechanism, but multiple pathways are available for individual tastants as well.",

When stimulated, these cells produce action potentials that result in the release of neurotransmitter onto an afferent nerve fiber that in turn relays the identity and intensity of the gustatory stimuli to the brain. A variety of mechanisms are used in transducing the four primary tastes. Direct interaction of the stimuli with ion channels appears to be of particular importance in transducing stimuli reported as salty or sour, whereas the second messenger systems cyclic AMP and inositol trisphosphate are important in transducing bitter and sweet stimuli. In addition to the four basic tastes, specific mechanisms exist for the amino acid glutamate, which is sometimes termed the fifth primary taste, and for fatty acids, a so-called nonconventional taste stimulus. The emerging picture is that not only do individual taste qualities use more than one mechanism, but multiple pathways are available for individual tastants as well.",

        "abstract": "As a group of naturally occurring peptides in various foods, γ-glutamyl peptides possess a unique Kokumi taste and health benefits. However, few studies have focused on the functionality of γ-glutamyl peptides. In this study, the γ-[glutamyl] (n=1, 2, 3)-tryptophan peptides were synthesized from a solution of glutamine (Gln) and tryptophan (Trp) employing L-glutaminase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Four different γ-glutamyl peptides were identified from the reaction mixture by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Under optimal conditions of pH 10, 37 °C, 3 h, 0.1 mol/L Gln: 0.1 mol/L Trp = 1:3, and glutaminase at 0.1% (m/v), the yields of γ-l-glutamyl-l-tryptophan (γ-EW), γ-l-glutamyl-γ-l-glutamyl-l-tryptophan (γ-EEW) and γ-l-glutamyl-γ-l-glutamyl-γ-l-glutamyl-l-tryptophan (γ-EEEW) were 51.02%, 26.12% and 1.91% respectively. The antioxidant properties of the reaction mixture and the two peptides (γ-EW, γ-EEW) identified from the reaction media were further compared. Results showed that γ-EW exhibited the highest DPPH•, ABTS•+ and O2•−-scavenging activity (EC50 = 0.2999 mg/mL, 67.6597 μg/mL and 5.99 mg/mL, respectively) and reducing power (EC50 = 4.61 mg/mL), while γ-EEW demonstrated the highest iron-chelating activity (76.22%). Thus, the synthesized mixture may be used as a potential source of antioxidant peptides for food and nutraceutical applications.",

            "abstract": "The antioxidant activity of the water extract of Tilia argentea Desf ex DC was determined by the thiocyanate method. The antioxidant activity of the water extract increased with the increasing amount of lyophilized extract (50-400 microg) added into the linoleic acid emulsion. Statistically significant effect was determined in 100 microg and higher amounts. Antioxidant activities of water extracts of tilia (Tilia argentea Desf ex DC), sage (Salvia triloba L.), and two Turkish black teas commercially called Rize tea and young shoot tea (Camellia sinensis) were compared. For comparison studies, 100 microg portions of extracts were added into test samples. All samples were able to show statistically significant antioxidant effect. Both of the tea extracts showed highest antioxidant activities, nevertheless, differences between tilia and sage and tilia and tea were not statistically significant (for both cases p > 0.05). Like antioxidant activity, the reducing power of water extract of Tilia argentea Desf ex DC was also concentration dependent. Even in the presence of 50 microg of extract, the reducing power was significantly higher than that of the control (p < 0.05) in which there was no extract. Unlike antioxidant activity, the highest reducing power activity was shown by sage extract. Among the tea extracts, young shoot extract was the most effective one, however, it had significantly lower activity than sage (p < 0.05). Although tea flower had the lowest reducing power activity, it was higher than that of tilia. But this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). From these results, we could suggest that although the reducing power of a substance may be an indicator of its potential antioxidant activity, there may not always be a linear correlation between these two activities. In addition, antimicrobial activities of each of the above extracts were studied by disk diffusion methods on different test microorganisms. None of the extracts showed antibacterial activity on the studied microorganisms.",

            "abstract": "Enzymatically hydrolyzed fish protein hydrolysates could be used as a source of antioxidative nutraceuticals. In our current work, we have investigated alkali-solubilized tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus) protein hydrolysates for their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and for their reducing power. Tilapia protein isolate was prepared by an alkaline solubilization technique and used as a substrate for enzyme hydrolysis. Cryotin, protease A 'Amano' 2, protease N 'Amano', Neutrase and Flavourzyme, were used separately to determine their effectiveness in hydrolyzing tilapia protein isolate. ROS scavenging ability was quantified using an isoluminol enhanced chemiluminescent assay in the presence of a) hydrogen peroxide or b) mononuclear cells isolated from human blood. Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of the hydrolysates using 2, 2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) or 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), were also investigated. Results showed that, in general, the TEAC, FRAP values and ROS scavenging ability of the hydrolysates increased with an increase in the degree of hydrolysis. Among the different hydrolysates, those prepared using Cryotin were most effective and Amano A2 hydrolysates were least effective in scavenging ABTS*(+) and ROS generated by hydrogen peroxide. However, FRAP assay showed that hydrolysates prepared using Flavourzyme were most effective, and Amano N and Neutrase hydrolysates were least effective in reducing ferric ions. No significant difference was observed among the hydrolysates produced with different enzymes in their ability to scavenge ROS generated by phorbol myristate acetate stimulated mononuclear cells. These results shed light on the in vitro ROS scavenging ability of alkali solubilized tilapia protein hydrolysates, as well as potential nutraceutical use of these hydrolysates.",

The optimum yield of γ‐D‐Glu‐L‐Trp was 55.76 mM in corresponding to a minimum yield of by‐product (γ‐D‐Glu‐γ‐D‐Glu‐L‐Trp) in the presence of 75 mM D‐Gln and 100 mM L‐Trp. The glutaminase has a low Km values for the donors (D‐Gln and L‐Gln:5.53 and 0.98 mM), but high ones for the acceptors (L‐Trp, L‐Phe, L‐Met, L‐Val and γ‐[D‐Glu]( n =1,2,3)‐L‐Val/L‐Phe/L‐Met, ranging from 32.51 to 193.05 mM). The highest Km value appearing when n = 2 (γ‐[D‐Glu]( n =0,1,2)‐L‐Val/L‐Phe/L‐Met) suggested the rising difficulty for synthesis when the number of donor increases in the reaction mixtures. The γ‐[D‐Glu]( n =1,2,3)‐L‐Val/L‐Phe/L‐Met at 5 mM can impart the blank chicken broth an enhancing monthfulness, thickness, and umaminess taste.",

            "abstract": "Genome sequences are available for increasing numbers of organisms. The proteomes (protein complement expressed by the genome) of many such organisms are being studied with two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis. Here we have investigated the application of short N-terminal and C-terminal sequence tags to the identification of proteins separated on 2D gels. The theoretical N and C termini of 15, 519 proteins, representing all SWISS-PROT entries for the organisms Mycoplasma genitalium, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human, were analysed. Sequence tags were found to be surprisingly specific, with N-terminal tags of four amino acid residues found to be unique for between 43% and 83% of proteins, and C-terminal tags of four amino acid residues unique for between 74% and 97% of proteins, depending on the species studied. Sequence tags of five amino acid residues were found to be even more specific. To utilise this specificity of sequence tags for protein identification, we created a world-wide web-accessible protein identification program, TagIdent (http://www.expasy.ch/www/tools.html), which matches sequence tags of up to six amino acid residues as well as estimated protein pI and mass against proteins in the SWISS-PROT database. We demonstrate the utility of this identification approach with sequence tags generated from 91 different E. coli proteins purified by 2D gel electrophoresis. Fifty-one proteins were unambiguously identified by virtue of their sequence tags and estimated pI and mass, and a further 11 proteins identified when sequence tags were combined with protein amino acid composition data. We conlcude that the TagIdent identification approach is best suited to the identification of proteins from prokaryotes whose complete genome sequences are available. The approach is less well suited to proteins from eukaryotes, as many eukaryotic proteins are not amenable to sequencing via Edman degradation, and tag protein identification cannot be unambiguous unless an organism's complete sequence is available.",

Measurement by RIA is hampered by the fact that most antisera are side-viewing or C-terminally directed, and recognize both intact GLP-1 and biologically inactive. N-terminally truncated fragments. Using high pressure liquid chromatography in combination with RIAs, methodology allowing specific determination of both intact GLP-1 and its metabolites was developed. Human plasma was shown to degrade GLP-1-(7-36)amide, forming an N-terminally truncated peptide with a t1/2 of 20.4 +/- 1.4 min at 37 C (n = 6). This was unaffected by EDTA or aprotinin. Inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV or low temperature (4 C) completely prevented formation of the metabolite, which was confirmed to be GLP-1-(9-36)amide by mass spectrometry and sequence analysis. High pressure liquid chromatography revealed the concentration of GLP-1-(9-36)amide to be 53.5 +/- 13.7% of the concentration of endogenous intact GLP-1 in the fasted state, which increased to 130.8 +/- 10.0% (P < 0.01; n = 6) 1 h postprandially. Metabolism at the C-terminus was not observed. This study suggests that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV is the primary mechanism for GLP-1 degradation in human plasma in vitro and may have a role in inactivating the peptide in vivo.",

The effect of drug (Sitagliptin®)/peptide and binary peptide mixtures on DPP-IV inhibition was studied using an isobole approach. Five peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Trp-Lys, Trp-Pro, Trp-Arg and Trp-Leu), having DPP-IV half maximum inhibitory concentration values (IC₅₀)<60 μM and reported to act through different inhibition mechanisms, were investigated. The dose response relationship of Sitagliptin : peptide (1:0, 0:1, 1:852, 1:426 and 1:1704 on a molar basis) and binary Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr : peptide (1:0, 0:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1 on a molar basis) mixtures for DPP-IV inhibition was characterised. Isobolographic analysis showed, in most instances, an additive effect on DPP-IV inhibition. However, a synergistic effect was observed with two Sitagliptin:Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr (1:426 and 1:852) mixtures and an antagonistic effect was seen with one Sitagliptin : Trp-Pro (1:852) mixture, and three binary peptide mixtures (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr : Trp-Lys (1:1 and 2:1) and Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr:Trp-Leu (1:2)). The results show that Sitagliptin and food protein-derived peptides can interact, thereby enhancing overall DPP-IV inhibition. Combination of Sitagliptin with food protein-derived peptides may help in reducing drug dosage and possible associated side-effects.",

            "abstract": "New dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)-inhibitory peptides from trypsin/chymotrypsin-treated goat milk casein hydrolysates were isolated and identified by two-dimensional silica thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC) combined to nano LC-MS/MS. 2D-TLC with chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (2:2:1) and n-butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1) as the first- and second-dimension eluents, respectively, in analytical and semipreparative scales, was set up and verified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to be feasible and efficient to separate the hydrolysates. Five new DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, four relatively large oligopeptides (MHQPPQPL, SPTVMFPPQSVL, VMFPPQSVL, and INNQFLPYPY), and AWPQYL were identified, and INNQFLPYPY showed a notable IC50 value of 40.08 μM as an uncompetitive inhibitor. Interactive effects on DPP-IV inhibition were also observed among separated fractions and pure synthetic peptide mixtures with concentration-dependent activity. The study gives new insights into goat casein hydrolysates with identified DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides efficiently isolated by 2D-TLC, which provides a simple and cost-efficient separation process and is compatible with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identification.",

        "abstract": "The regulation of the benzamil (Bz)-insensitive salt taste receptor was investigated by intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), protein kinase C (PKC), and the Ca2+-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase, calcineurin (PP2B), by monitoring chorda tympani taste nerve responses to 0.1 M NaCl solutions containing Bz (5x10(-6) M) and resiniferatoxin (RTX; 0-10x10(-6) M) in Sprague-Dawley rats and in wild-type (WT) and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 knockout (TRPV1 KO) mice. In rats and WT mice, RTX increased the NaCl+Bz chorda tympani responses between 0.25x10(-6) and 1x10(-6) M and inhibited the responses above 1x10(-6) M. Decreasing taste receptor cell (TRC) [Ca2+]i with BAPTA loading, activation of PKC with 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (PMA), or inhibition of PP2B by cyclosporin A or FK-506, enhanced the magnitude of the Bz-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani responses in the presence of RTX and either minimized or completely eliminated the decrease in the chorda tympani response>1x10(-6) M RTX. In contrast, increasing TRC [Ca2+]i with ionomycin inhibited Bz-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani responses in the presence of RTX. No effect of the cited modulators was observed on the chorda tympani responses in WT mice and rats in the presence of TRPV1 blocker SB-366791 (1x10(-6) M) or in TRPV1 KO mice. 32P-labeling demonstrated direct phosphorylation of TRPV1 or TRPV1t in anterior lingual epithelium by PMA, cyclosporin A, or FK-506. PMA also enhanced the RTX-sensitive unilateral apical Na+ flux in polarized fungiform TRC in vitro. We conclude that TRPV1 or its variant TRPV1t is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by PKC and PP2B, respectively, and either sensitizes or desensitizes the Bz-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani responses to RTX stimulation.",

            "abstract": "Current evidence suggests salt taste transduction involves at least two mechanisms, one that is amiloride sensitive and appears to use apically located epithelial sodium channels relatively selective for Na(+) and a second that is amiloride insensitive and uses a variant of the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) that serves as a nonspecific cation channel. To provide a functional context for these findings, we trained Trpv1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice (n = 9 or 10/group) in a two-response operant discrimination procedure and measured detection thresholds to NaCl and KCl with and without amiloride. The KO and WT mice had similar detection thresholds for NaCl and KCl. Amiloride shifted the NaCl sensitivity curve to the same degree in both groups and had virtually no effect on KCl thresholds. In addition, a more detailed analysis of chorda tympani nerve (CT) responses to NaCl, with and without benzamil (Bz, an amiloride analog) treatment revealed that the tonic portion of the CT response of KO mice to NaCl + Bz was absent, but both KO and WT mice displayed some degree of a phasic response to NaCl with and without Bz. Because these transients constitute the entire CT response to NaCl + Bz in Trpv1 KO mice, it is possible that these signals are sufficient to maintain normal NaCl detectabilty in the behavioral task used here. Additionally, there may be other amiloride-insensitive salt transduction mechanisms in taste receptor fields other than the anterior tongue that maintain normal salt detection performance in the KO mice.",

CT responses in Sprague-Dawley rats and both wildtype and TRPV1 knockout (KO) mice were recorded in the presence and absence of agonists [resiniferatoxin (RTX) and elevated temperature] and an antagonist (SB-366791) of TRPV1t, the ENaC blocker (Bz), and varying apical pH (pH(o)). At concentrations <0.015 M, nicotine enhanced and at >0.015 M, it inhibited CT responses to KCl and NaCl. Nicotine produced maximum enhancement in the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response at pH(o) between 6 and 7. RTX and elevated temperature increased the sensitivity of the CT response to nicotine in salt-containing media, and SB-366791 inhibited these effects. TRPV1 KO mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive CT response to NaCl and no sensitivity to nicotine, RTX, and elevated temperature. We conclude that nicotine modulates salt responses by direct interaction with TRPV1t. At pH(o) >8, the apical membrane permeability of nicotine was increased significantly, resulting in increase in TRC pH(i) and volume, activation of ENaC, and enhancement of the Bz-sensitive NaCl CT response. At pH(o) >8, nicotine also inhibited the phasic component of the HCl CT response. We conclude that the effects of nicotine on ENaC and the phasic HCl CT response arise from increases in TRC pH(i) and volume.",

            "abstract": "The capsaicin receptor, VR1, is a sensory neuron-specific ion channel that serves as a polymodal detector of pain-producing chemical and physical stimuli. It has been reported that ATP, one of the inflammatory mediators, potentiates the VR1 currents evoked by capsaicin or protons and reduces the temperature threshold for activation of VR1 through metabotropic P2Y1 receptors in a protein Kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway, suggesting the phosphorylation of VR1 by PKC. In this study, direct phosphorylation of VR1 upon application of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was proven biochemically in cells expressing VR1. An in vitro kinase assay using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins with cytoplasmic segments of VR1 showed that both the first intracellular loop and carboxyl terminus of VR1 were phosphorylated by PKCε. Patch clamp analysis of the point mutants where Ser or Thr residues were replaced with Ala in the total 16 putative phosphorylation sites showed that two Ser residues, Ser502and Ser800 were involved in the potentiation of the capsaicin-evoked currents by either PMA or ATP. In the cells expressing S502A/S800A double mutant, the temperature threshold for activation was not reduced upon PMA treatment. The two sites would be promising targets for the development of substance modulating VR1 function, thereby reducing pain.",

If ENaC were involved in human salt sensing, then the lingual surface potential (LSP) would hyperpolarize when exposed to sodium. We developed a chamber to measure the LSP while different solutions superfused the surface of the tongue and a technique to adjust for the junction potentials induced by varying salt concentrations. Changing the superfusion solution from rinse solution (30 mM KCl) to 300 mM NaCl (+30 mM KCl) caused the LSP to hyperpolarize by 10.1 +/- 0.7 mV (n = 13, P < 0.001). With repeated challenge the LSP response was reproducible. Increasing the Na concentration from 100 to 600 mM increased hyperpolarization by 35 +/- 4.8% (n = 9, P < 0.001). To examine whether amiloride affects the LSP, 0.1 mM amiloride was added to 300 mM NaCl; it reduced the hyperpolarization by 18.5 +/- 4.3% (P < 0.005, n = 11). However, the amiloride effect was not uniform: in six volunteers, amiloride inhibited the LSP by as much as 42%, while in five subjects, amiloride inhibited <5% of the LSP. In an amiloride sensitive volunteer, amiloride exerted 50% of its effect at 1 microM. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the LSP can be measured in humans, that Na hyperpolarizes the LSP, that increasing the Na concentration increases LSP hyperpolarization, and that amiloride inhibits the Na evoked LSP in some humans. While ENaC is involved in sensing salt, its role appears to vary among individuals.",

            "abstract": "Protein kinase C (PKC) was first implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction with the observation that phorbol esters induce slowly developing, sustained contractions. In some vascular smooth muscles, e.g., ferret aorta, phorbol ester induced contractions occur without an increase in sarcoplasmic free-Ca2+ concentration ([Ca]i) or myosin light chain phosphorylation. This response appears to be mediated by a Ca(2+)-independent isoenzyme of PKC (probably PKC epsilon), since saponin-permeabilized single ferret aortic smooth muscle cells, which retain receptor coupling, developed force in response to phenylephrine at low free [Ca2+] (pCa 7.0-8.6) and the constitutively active proteolytic fragment of PKC (PKM) elicited a contraction at pCa 7 comparable with the phenylephrine-induced contraction. Both contractions were reversed by a pseudo-substrate peptide inhibitor of PKC. These observations suggest a mechanism whereby alpha-adrenergic agonists may elicit a contractile response without a Ca2+ signal: alpha-adrenergic stimulation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C or D (the latter in conjunction with phosphatidate phosphohydrolase) generates diacylglycerol. In the absence of an increase in [Ca2+]i, diacylglycerol specifically activates so-called novel PKCs, of which epsilon is the only isoenzyme known to be expressed in vascular smooth muscle. Recent evidence suggests that PKC may trigger a cascade of phosphorylation reactions, resulting in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation of the thin filament associated protein caldesmon. Alternatively, or additionally, PKC may directly phosphorylate calponin, another thin filament associated protein. These phosphorylations are predicted to alleviate inhibition of the cross-bridge cycling rate by these thin-filament proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

However, the steady-state CT responses to 150 mM NaCl were significantly increased when the stimulus solutions also contained 300 mM mannitol or cellobiose, but not 600 mM urea or DMSO. The enhanced CT responses to NaCl were reversed when the saccharides were removed and were completely blocked by addition of 100 microM amiloride to the stimulus solution. Exposure of TRCs to hyperosmotic solutions of mannitol or cellobiose induced a rapid and sustained decrease in cell volume that was completely reversible, whereas exposure to hypertonic urea or DMSO did not induce sustained reductions in cell volume. These data suggest that the osmolyte-induced increase in the CT response to NaCl involves a sustained decrease in TRC volume and the activation of amiloride-sensitive apical Na(+) channels.",

Using Ca2+-imaging, we have previously shown that desensitization of TRPV1 upon successive capsaicin applications was reversed by protein kinase C activation in dorsal root ganglion neurons and CHO cells. Here, using both Ca2+-imaging and patch-clamp methods, we show that PMA-induced activation of PKCepsilon is essential for increased sensitivity of desensitized TRPV1. TRPV1 has two putative substrates S502 and S800 for PKCepsilon-mediated phosphorylation. Patch-clamp analysis showed that contribution of single mutant S502A or S800A towards increased sensitivity of desensitized TRPV1 is indistinguishable from that observed in a double mutant S502A/S800A. Since S502 is a non-specific substrate for TRPV1 phosphorylation by kinases like PKC, PKA or CAMKII, evidence for a role of PKC specific substrate S800 was investigated. Evidence for in vivo phosphorylation of TRPV1 at S800 was demonstrated for the first time. We also show that the expression level of PKCepsilon paralleled the amount of phosphorylated TRPV1 protein using an antibody specific for phosphorylated TRPV1 at S800. Furthermore, the anti-phosphoTRPV1 antibody detected phosphorylation of TRPV1 in mouse and rat DRG neurons and may be useful for research regarding nociception in native tissues. This study, therefore, identifies PKCepsilon and S800 as important therapeutic targets that may help regulate inhibitory effects on TRPV1 and hence its desensitization.",

In the late 1900s, umami was internationally recognized as the fifth basic taste based on psychophysical, electrophysiological, and biochemical studies. Three umami receptors (T1R1 + T1R3, mGluR4, and mGluR1) were identified. There is a synergism between glutamate and the 5′-nucleotides. Among the above receptors, only T1R1 + T1R3 receptor exhibits the synergism. In rats, the response to a mixture of glutamate and 5′-inosinate is about 1.7 times larger than that to glutamate alone. In human, the response to the mixture is about 8 times larger than that to glutamate alone. Since glutamate and 5′-inosinate are contained in various foods, we taste umami induced by the synergism in daily eating. Hence umami taste induced by the synergism is a main umami taste in human.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In order to improve the flavor of aquatic enzymatic hydrolysate, this study determined the effect of ultra-high pressure processing (UHP) coupled with enzymatic hydrolysis on the flavor of Alaska pollock frame (APF) hydrolysates. The optimal conditions for UHP enzymatic hydrolysis were as follows: pressure time was 60 min, pH value was 7.5, and pressure was 150 MPa. The content of soluble peptide, total-free amino acid, and delicious amino acid (DAA) content of atmospheric pressure and UHP hydrolysates were 11.37 vs 16.70 mg/mL, 5 528 vs 6 234 mg/100 g, and 2145 vs 2411 mg/100 g, respectively. The major compounds in the enzymatic hydrolysates of UHP included seven types of ketones (18.31%), 8 types of aldehydes (6.35%), 3 types of alcohols (2.61%), one type of ester (0.38%), and one type of furan (7.89%). The results of electronic tongue (e-tongue) demonstrated good agreement with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In conclusion, UHP enzymatic hydrolysis can be a potential tool to improve the flavor compounds of hydrolysates.",

In this study, odorants in steamed male E. sinensis were investigated using the headspace-monolithic material sorptive extraction technique coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O). A total of 74 volatile compounds were found, and the results of the GC-MS-O analysis, combined with odor activity values, showed that trimethylamine (fishy, ammonia-like odor), (Z)-4-heptenal (mushroom-like odor), and benzaldehyde (paint-like odor) were the important odorants (IOs) in all 4 of the edible parts of steamed male E. sinensis. Furthermore, heptanal (mushroom-like odor) was common to the abdomen, claw, and leg meat but was not found as the IO in the gonad. The abdomen meat also contained 3-methylbutanal (vegetable-like, grassy odor), while 2 additional IOs were found in claw meat (2-methylbutanal, which has a mushroom odor and 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazine, which has a chocolate-like, musty odor). Another IO (2-nonanone, chocolate-like odor) was also found in leg meat, while (E)-2-nonenal (green, fruity odor) was the IO found exclusively in the gonad.",

This paper reviews aspects influencing the formation of these aldehydes at the level of metabolic conversions, microbial and food composition. Special emphasis was on 3-methyl butanal and its presence in various food products. Knowledge gained about the generation pathways of these flavour compounds is essential for being able to control the formation of desired levels of these aldehydes.",

The extent of unfolding increased with the pressure level. The structure of beta-lactoglobulin required higher pressures to unfold at pH 2.5 than at pH 6.8. More flexibility was achieved at 37 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. Results indicated that the structural region formed by strands F, G, and H was more resistant to unfold under acidic and neutral conditions. The exposure of Trp19 at an earlier time, as compared to other protein regions, supports the formation of a swollen structural state at pH 2.5. Refolding was achieved faster when beta-lactoglobulin was subjected to 200 MPa than to 400 MPa, to 37 degrees C than to 25 degrees C, and to acidic than to neutral pH. After treatment at 400 MPa for 20 min at neutral pH, the protein native structure was not recovered. All samples at acidic pH showed that the protein quickly regained its structure. Hydrolysis of beta-lactoglobulin by pepsin and chymotrypsin could be related to pressure-induced changes in the structure of the protein. Compared to the behavior of the protein at atmospheric pressure, no increased proteolysis was found in samples with no increased flexibility (100 MPa, 37 degrees C, pH 2.5). Slightly flexible structures were associated with significantly increased proteolysis (100 MPa, 37 degrees C, pH 6.8; 200 MPa, 37 degrees C, pH 2.5). Highly flexible structures were associated with very fast proteolysis (>or=200 MPa, 37 degrees C, pH 6.8; >or=300 MPa, 37 degrees C, pH 2.5). Proteolysis of prepressurized samples improved only when the protein was significantly changed after the pressure treatment (400 MPa, 25 degrees C, 20 min, pH 6.8).",

Higher levels of lipid oxidation products were found in the aroma extracts of all of the steaks with increased PUFA content, after cooking. In particular, n-alkanals, 2-alkenals, 1-alkanols, and alkylfurans were increased up to 4-fold. Most of these compounds were derived from the autoxidation of the more abundant mono- and di-unsaturated fatty acids during cooking, and such autoxidation appeared to be promoted by increased levels of PUFAs.",

            "abstract": "Egg proteins are responsible for one of the most common forms of food allergy, especially in children, and one of the major allergens is ovalbumin (OVA). With the aim to examine the potential of high pressure to enhance the enzymatic hydrolysis of OVA and modify its immunoreactivity, the protein was proteolyzed with pepsin under high-pressure conditions (400 MPa). Characterization of the hydrolysates and peptide identification was performed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-MS/MS). The antigenicity (binding to IgG) and binding to IgE, using the sera of patients with specific IgE to OVA, were also assessed. The results showed that, upon treatment with pepsin at 400 MPa, all of the intact protein was removed in minutes, leading to the production of hydrolysates with lower antigenicity than those produced in hours at atmospheric pressure. However, the exposure of new target residues only partially facilitated the removal of allergenic epitopes, because the hydrolysates retained residual IgG- and IgE-binding properties as a result of the accumulation of large and hydrophobic peptides during the initial stages of hydrolysis. These peptides disappeared at later stages of proteolysis, although reactivity toward IgG and IgE was not completely abolished. Some fragments identified in the hydrolysates (such as Leu124-Phe134, Ile178-Ala187, Leu242-Leu252, Gly251-Ile259, Lys322-Gly343, Phe358-Phe366, and Phe378-Pro385) carried previously identified IgE-binding epitopes. Because some of the peptides found, such as Phe358-Phe366, probably contain only one binding site for IgE, the possibility to use high pressure to tailor hydrolysates that contain mostly peptides with only one IgE-binding site, which may help the immune system to tolerate egg proteins, is suggested.",

The determination was performed using an improved HPLC system with isocratic elution. The level of ATP-related compounds in the adductor muscle was about twice that found in the other 3 tissues tested. In adductor muscle, ATP decreased rapidly, while AMP and IMP accu-mulated. Only adductor muscle contained AdR. The K value in the adductor muscle increased linearly but slowly during storage (about 22% at the initial decomposition stage), while the K' value increased rapidly and reached about 70% at the initial decomposition stage and thereafter remained constant. In mantle, gill, and body trunk, ATP levels decreased slowly, whereas ADP and AMP accumulated. IMP was present at low levels. The K values in the 3 tissues were low at the acceptable stage. The K' value increased slowly but linearly during storage. A. E. C. value decreased rapidly and continuously from 70-80% to 10-20% during the acceptable stage. Although K or K' values in the adductor muscle and K' or A. E. C. values in the other 3 tissues could be used as freshness indices, the K' value in the adductor muscle and the A. E. C. value in the other 3 tissues appeared to be most useful as freshness indices of oysters.",

The number of people diagnosed with cancer within the next few decades is expected to double. There will therefore be increased demand for novel diagnostic and medical therapies that use new non-traditional sources. Soybeans contain a variety of anticarcinogenic phytochemicals. Recently, there has been increased interest in the potential health benefits of bioactive polypeptides and proteins from soybeans, including lunasin and lectins. Lunasin is a polypeptide that arrests cell division and induces apoptosis in malignant cells. Lectins are glycoproteins that selectively bind carbohydrates; lectins are used in medicine in a variety of new applications. Additional research, including clinical trials, should continue to examine and elucidate the therapeutic effects, nutritional benefits, and toxic consequences of commonly ingested soybean lectins and lunasin.",

In sharp contrast, only approximately 25 taste 2 receptors (TAS2R) bitter taste receptors have been identified, raising the question as to how the vast array of bitter compounds can be detected by such a limited number of sensors. To address this issue, we have challenged 25 human taste 2 receptors (hTAS2Rs) with 104 natural or synthetic bitter chemicals in a heterologous expression system. Thirteen cognate bitter compounds for 5 orphan receptors and 64 new compounds for previously identified receptors were discovered. Whereas some receptors recognized only few agonists, others displayed moderate or extreme tuning broadness. Thus, 3 hTAS2Rs together were able to detect approximately 50% of the substances used. Conversely, though 63 bitter substances activated only 1-3 receptors, 19 compounds stimulated up to 15 hTAS2Rs. Our data suggest that the detection of the numerous bitter chemicals is related to the molecular receptive ranges of hTAS2Rs.",

The T2Rs are conserved among mammals with the human and mouse gene families consisting of about 25 members. In the present study we address the signalling properties of human and mouse T2Rs using an in vitro reconstitution system in which both the ligands and G-proteins being assayed can be manipulated independently and quantitatively assessed. We confirm that the mT2R5, hT2R43 and hT2R47 receptors respond selectively to micromolar concentrations of cycloheximide, aristolochic acid and denatonium respectively. We also demonstrate that hT2R14 is a receptor for aristolochic acid and report the first characterization of the ligand specificities of hT2R7, which is a broadly tuned receptor responding to strychnine, quinacrine, chloroquine and papaverine. Using these defined ligand-receptor interactions, we assayed the ability of the ligand-activated T2Rs to catalyse GTP binding on divergent members of the G(alpha) family including three members of the G(alphai) subfamily (transducin, G(alphai1) and G(alphao)) as well as G(alphas) and G(alphaq). The T2Rs coupled with each of the three G(alphai) members tested. However, none of the T2Rs coupled to either G(alphas) or G(alphaq), suggesting the T2Rs signal primarily through G(alphai)-mediated signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, we observed different G-protein selectivities among the T2Rs with respect to both G(alphai) subunits and G(betagamma) dimers, suggesting that bitter taste is transduced by multiple G-proteins that may differ among the T2Rs.",

            "abstract": "Leptin is a hormone that regulates body weight homeostasis mainly via the hypothalamic functional leptin receptor Ob-Rb. Recently, we proposed that the taste organ is a new peripheral target for leptin. Leptin selectively inhibits mouse taste cell responses to sweet substances and thereby may act as a sweet taste modulator. The present study further investigated leptin action on the taste system by examining expression of Ob-Rb in taste cells and behavioral responses to sweet substances in leptin-deficient ob/ob, and Ob-Rb-deficient db/db mice and their normal litter mates. RT-PCR analysis showed that Ob-Rb was expressed in taste cells in all strains tested. The db/db mice, however, had a RT-PCR product containing an abnormal db insertion that leads to an impaired shorter intracellular domain. In situ hybridization analysis showed that the hybridization signals for normal Ob-Rb mRNA were detected in taste cells in lean and ob/ob mice but not in db/db mice. Two different behavioral tests, one using sweet-bitter mixtures as taste stimuli and the other a conditioned taste aversion paradigm, demonstrated that responses to sucrose and saccharin were significantly decreased after ip injection of leptin in ob/ob and normal littermates, but not in db/db mice. These results suggest that leptin suppresses behavioral responses to sweet substances through its action on Ob-Rb in taste cells. Such taste modulation by leptin may be involved in regulation for food intake.",

            "abstract": "Mammals use common mechanisms to detect, transduce and process taste stimulus information. For example, they share families of receptors that respond to amino acids, and sweet- and bitter-tasting stimuli. Nonetheless, it also clear that different species exhibit unique taste sensitivities that may reflect specific genetic variations. In humans, sensitivities to the chemically similar, bitter-tasting compounds 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) are heritable and strongly correlated, suggesting a common genetic basis. However, it is unknown whether PROP and PTC taste sensitivities are similarly correlated in mice. Here we report that PROP and PTC taste sensitivities vary independently between two inbred strains of mice. In brief-access taste tests C3HeB/FeJ (C3) and SWR/J (SW) mice possess similar taste sensitivity to PTC, while SW mice are significantly more sensitive to PROP than are C3 mice. In two-bottle preference tests, however, SW mice display greater aversion to both compounds. This discrepancy may be explained by the observation that SW mice consumed taste solutions at a greater rate during the intake test than did C3 mice. Therefore, PTC avoidance is correlated with the amount of PTC consumed in the intake tests rather than the concentration of PTC tested. These findings suggest that post-ingestive factors play a significant role in PTC avoidance during intake tests and highlight an important advantage of brief-access tests over intake tests in resolving the gustatory and post-ingestive contributions to taste-related behaviors. Most strikingly, these results demonstrate that in mice, unlike in humans, PTC and PROP taste sensitivities vary independently, thereby suggesting a subtle functional diversity of bitter-taste mechanisms across mammalian species.",

We report here that, as a component downstream of PLCbeta2, the type 3 isoform of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptor (IP(3)R3) is specifically expressed in the same cells as PLCbeta2 in rat taste buds. We also show that cells expressing rT2R9, a probable cycloheximide receptor, are included among PLCbeta2- and IP(3)R3-positive cells, as in the case of rT1R2, a different type of taste receptor. Our findings indicate that PLCbeta2 and IP(3)R3 co-localize together with G(i2) as downstream components of two different types of taste receptors, T1R and T2R, in taste bud cells.",

To investigate the role of glucagon in the regulation of insulin secretion and whole body glucose homeostasis in vivo, we generated mice overexpressing the Gcgr specifically on pancreatic beta-cells (RIP-Gcgr). In vivo and in vitro insulin secretion in response to glucagon and glucose was increased 1.7- to 3.9-fold in RIP-Gcgr mice compared with controls. Consistent with the observed increase in insulin release in response to glucagon and glucose, the glucose excursion resulting from both a glucagon challenge and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was significantly reduced in RIP-Gcgr mice compared with controls. However, RIP-Gcgr mice display similar glucose responses to an insulin challenge. beta-Cell mass and pancreatic insulin content were also increased (20 and 50%, respectively) in RIP-Gcgr mice compared with controls. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), both control and RIP-Gcgr mice developed similar degrees of obesity and insulin resistance. However, the severity of both fasting hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were reduced in RIP-Gcgr mice compared with controls. Furthermore, the insulin response of RIP-Gcgr mice to an IPGTT was twice that of controls when fed the HFD. These data indicate that increased pancreatic beta-cell expression of the Gcgr increased insulin secretion, pancreatic insulin content, beta-cell mass, and, when mice were fed a HFD, partially protected against hyperglycemia and IGT.",

We investigated the expression and function of the sweet taste receptor in MIN6 cells and mouse islets. Methodology/Principal Findings The expression of the sweet taste receptor was determined by RT–PCR and immunohistochemistry. Changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]c) and cAMP ([cAMP]c) were monitored in MIN6 cells using fura-2 and Epac1-camps. Activation of protein kinase C was monitored by measuring translocation of MARCKS-GFP. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay. mRNA for T1R2, T1R3, and gustducin was expressed in MIN6 cells. In these cells, artificial sweeteners such as sucralose, succharin, and acesulfame-K increased insulin secretion and augmented secretion induced by glucose. Sucralose increased biphasic increase in [Ca2+]c. The second sustained phase was blocked by removal of extracellular calcium and addition of nifedipine. An inhibitor of inositol(1, 4, 5)-trisphophate receptor, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, blocked both phases of [Ca2+]c response. The effect of sucralose on [Ca2+]c was inhibited by gurmarin, an inhibitor of the sweet taste receptor, but not affected by a Gq inhibitor. Sucralose also induced sustained elevation of [cAMP]c, which was only partially inhibited by removal of extracellular calcium and nifedipine. Finally, mouse islets expressed T1R2 and T1R3, and artificial sweeteners stimulated insulin secretion. Conclusions Sweet taste receptor is expressed in β-cells, and activation of this receptor induces insulin secretion by Ca2+ and cAMP-dependent mechanisms.",

The obese diabetic db/db mouse, which has defects in leptin receptor, displays enhanced neural responses and elevated behavioral preference to sweet stimuli. Here, we show the effects of leptin on the peripheral taste system. An administration of leptin into lean mice suppressed responses of peripheral taste nerves (chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal) to sweet substances (sucrose and saccharin) without affecting responses to sour, salty, and bitter substances. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of activities of taste receptor cells isolated from circumvallate papillae (innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve) demonstrated that leptin activated outward K(+) currents, which resulted in hyperpolarization of taste cells. The db/db mouse with impaired leptin receptors showed no such leptin suppression. Taste tissue (circumvallate papilla) of lean mice expressed leptin-receptor mRNA and some of the taste cells exhibited immunoreactivities to antibodies of the leptin receptor. Taken together, these observations suggest that the taste organ is a peripheral target for leptin, and that leptin may be a sweet-sensing modulator (suppressor) that may take part in regulation of food intake. Defects in this leptin suppression system in db/db mice may lead to their enhanced peripheral neural responses and enhanced behavioral preferences for sweet substances.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that neuropeptides could play previously unrecognized functional roles in peripheral gustation. To date, two peptides, cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal peptide, have been localized to subsets of taste-bud (TB) cells (TBC) and one, cholecystokinin, has been demonstrated to produce excitatory physiological actions. This study extends our knowledge of neuropeptides in TBC in three significant ways. First, using techniques of immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR, evidence is presented for the expression of a third peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY). Like other peptide expression patterns, NPY expression is circumscribed to a subset of cells within the taste bud. Second, using physiological studies, we demonstrate that NPY specifically enhances an inwardly rectifying potassium current via NPY-Y1 receptors. This action is antagonistic to the previously demonstrated inhibitory effect exerted by cholecystokinin on the same current, thus providing important clues to their signaling roles in the TB. Third, using the technique of double-labeled fluorescent immunocytochemistry, the relationship of three subsets of neuropeptide-expressing TB cells to one another was examined. Remarkably, NPY expressions, although fewer in number than either the cholecystokinin or vasoactive intestinal peptide subsets, overlapped 100% with either peptide. Collectively, these three observations transform previously suggestive roles of neuromodulation by peptides in TB cells to more concrete signaling pathways. The extensive colocalization of these peptides suggests they may be subject to similar presynaptic influences of release yet have antagonistic postsynaptic actions. The convergence or divergence of these postsynaptic actions awaits further investigation.",

We have addressed this issue by combining recordings of membrane capacitance (to monitor exocytosis) in individual alpha-cells with biochemical assays of glucagon secretion and cAMP content in intact pancreatic islets, as well as analyses of glucagon receptor expression in pure alpha-cell fractions by RT-PCR. Glucagon stimulated cAMP generation and exocytosis dose dependently with an EC50 of 1.6-1.7 nm. The stimulation of both parameters plateaued at concentrations beyond 10 nm of glucagon where a more than 3-fold enhancement was observed. The actions of glucagon were unaffected by the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9-39) but abolished by des-His1-[Glu9]-glucagon-amide, a specific blocker of the glucagon receptor. The effects of glucagon on alpha-cell exocytosis were mimicked by forskolin and the stimulatory actions of glucagon and forskolin on exocytosis were both reproduced by intracellular application of 0.1 mm cAMP. cAMP-potentiated exocytosis involved both PKA-dependent and -independent (resistant to Rp-cAMPS, an Rp-isomer of cAMP) mechanisms. The presence of the cAMP-binding protein cAMP-guanidine nucleotide exchange factor II in alpha-cells was documented by a combination of immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR and 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2'-O-methyl-cAMP, a cAMP-guanidine nucleotide exchange factor II-selective agonist, mimicked the effect of cAMP and augmented rapid exocytosis in a PKA-independent manner. We conclude that glucagon released from the alpha-cells, in addition to its well-documented systemic effects and paracrine actions within the islet, also represents an autocrine regulator of alpha-cell function.",

Compared with CYE, in a thermally treated autolysate prepared under laboratory conditions from baker's yeast (SPYA) several odorants, e.g., methional, 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline, 3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethyl-2(5H)-furanone (Sotolon), phenylacetic acid, and 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine, showed higher flavor dilution (FD) factors, whereas the reverse was found for 2-furanmethanethiol (FMT). The amounts of its precursor amino acid cysteine in the CYE and the SPYA were well correlated with the different odor activities of the FMT in both solutions.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMany randomised trials assessing the effect of salt reduction on blood pressure show reduction in blood pressure in individuals with high blood pressure. However, there is controversy about the magnitude and the clinical significance of the fall in blood pressure in individuals with normal blood pressure. Several meta-analyses of randomised salt reduction trials have been published in the last few years. However, most of these included trials of very short duration (e.g. 5 days) and included trials with salt loading followed by salt deprivation (e.g. from 20 to 1 g/day) over only a few days. These short-term experiments are not appropriate to inform public health policy which is for a modest reduction in salt intake over a prolonged period of time. A meta-analysis by Hooper et al is an important attempt to look at whether advice to achieve a long-term salt reduction (i.e. more than 6 months) in randomised trials causes a fall in blood pressure. However, most trials included in this meta-analysis achieved a small reduction in salt intake; on average, salt intake was reduced by 2 g/day. It is, therefore, not surprising that this analysis showed a small fall in blood pressure, and that a dose-response to salt reduction was not demonstrable.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effect of the currently recommended modest reduction in salt intake (WHO 2003; SACN 2003; Whelton 2002), on blood pressure in individuals with normal and elevated blood pressure. To assess whether the magnitude of the reduction in blood pressure is dependent on the magnitude of the reduction in salt intake.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, CINAHL, and reference list of original and review articles.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included randomised trials with a modest reduction in salt intake and a duration of 4 or more weeks.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nData were extracted independently by two persons. Mean effect sizes were calculated using both fixed and random effect models using Review Manager 4.2.1 software. Weighted linear regression was used to examine the relationship between the change in urinary sodium and the change in blood pressure. We used funnel plots to detect publication and other biases in the meta-analysis.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nSeventeen trials in individuals with elevated blood pressure (n=734) and 11 trials in individuals with normal blood pressure (n=2220) were included. In individuals with elevated blood pressure the median reduction in 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 78 mmol (4.6 g/day of salt), the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was -4.97 mmHg (95%CI:-5.76 to -4.18), and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was -2.74 mmHg (95% CI:-3.22 to -2.26). In individuals with normal blood pressure the median reduction in 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 74 mmol (4.4 g/day of salt), the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was -2.03 mmHg (95% CI: -2.56 to -1.50) mmHg, and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was -0.99 mmHg (-1.40 to -0.57). Weighted linear regression analyses showed a correlation between the reduction in urinary sodium and the reduction in blood pressure.\n\n\nREVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS\nOur meta-analysis demonstrates that a modest reduction in salt intake for a duration of 4 or more weeks has a significant and, from a population viewpoint, important effect on blood pressure in both individuals with normal and elevated blood pressure. These results support other evidence suggesting that a modest and long-term reduction in population salt intake could reduce strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure. Furthermore, our meta-analysis demonstrates a correlation between the magnitude of salt reduction and the magnitude of blood pressure reduction. Within the daily intake range of 3 to 12 g/day, the lower the salt intake achieved, the lower the blood pressure.",

Systemic endothelial dysfunction, for which albuminuria is presumed to be a sensitive biomarker, likely underlies, at least in part, these combined cardiorenal effects.1 A large body of experimental data implicates the independent roles of aldosterone and high dietary salt ingestion in contributing to the development of kidney disease separate from the effects of high blood pressure.2,3 Less well documented is the degree to which aldosterone and dietary salt contribute to renal disease in humans and, in particular, how these factors interact to effect renal function.\n\nIn this issue of Hypertension , Rossi et al4 report that patients with newly diagnosed hypertension who were confirmed to have primary aldosteronism had greater UAE than newly diagnosed hypertensive patients without primary aldosteronism. In all of the patients, urinary sodium excretion independently predicted UAE. These results both compare and contrast with recent results from Framingham investigators who found that in a cohort of normotensive and hypertensive subjects, UAE was positively associated in a continuous fashion with urinary sodium excretion.5 No such association was seen with serum aldosterone, although UAE was higher in subjects in the highest quintile of serum aldosterone levels. These 2 studies emphasize the importance of the combined roles of aldosterone and dietary salt ingestion in the progression of kidney disease while also generating important research questions to further explore the clinical ramifications of this interaction.\n\nA large number of animal studies have confirmed the inflammatory, fibrotic, and thrombotic effects of hyperaldosteronism on target organs, including the heart, brain, and kidney. …",

The present study quantified the contributions of inherently food-borne, processing-added, table, cooking, and water sources in 62 adults who were regular users of discretionary salt to allow such an assessment. Seven-day dietary records, potable water collections, and preweighted salt shakers were used to estimate Na intake. Na added during processing contributed 77% of total intake, 11.6% was derived from Na inherent to food, and water was a trivial source. The observed table (6.2%) and cooking (5.1%) values may overestimate the contribution of these sources in the general population due to sample characteristics, yet they were still markedly lower than previously reported values. These findings, coupled with similar observations from other studies, indicate that reduction of discretionary salt will contribute little to moderation of total Na intake in the population.",

            "abstract": "Several studies have examined the association of blood pressure (BP) after myocardial infarction (MI) with a risk for adverse outcome; however, few studies have investigated prognosis after MI as a function of BP before MI. Our goal was to examine the relation of antecedent hypertension to risk of adverse outcomes after initial MI. From 1967 to 1990, 404 subjects followed at the Framingham Heart Study developed an initial MI. These subjects were classified on the basis of preinfarction BP into normotensive (BP<140/90 mm Hg and not receiving antihypertensive treatment; n=118), stage I-untreated hypertension (BP 140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg; n=89), and stage II to IV or treated hypertension (BP > or =160/100 mm Hg or treated hypertension; n=197). Cox models were used to adjust for age, sex, smoking, glucose intolerance, total cholesterol, and prior cardiovascular disease. Antecedent hypertension was related to risk of adverse outcome after MI. Compared with normotensive individuals, stage II to IV hypertensives were at increased risk for reinfarction (hazard ratio [HR], 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20 to 4.04). A similar but nonsignificant association was seen in stage I hypertensives (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.97 to 3.77). Stage II to IV hypertensives were at increased risk for all-cause mortality compared with normotensive persons (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.98). Thus, even after MI, a history of antecedent hypertension remains predictive of adverse outcome. These findings are consistent with beneficial effects of BP control in primary and secondary prevention settings. Effective BP control may both reduce the risk for an initial MI and improve outcome in the event that an MI occurs.",

A heart attack is typically caused by a blockage (usually a blood clot) in a coronary artery that severely restricts or cuts off the blood supply to a region of the heart. If this lasts more than a few minutes, heart tissue dies.2 Congestive heart failure occurs when the heart can no longer pump blood at the rate needed by the body’s tissues. A stroke involves loss of brain function when a clot or piece of atherosclerotic plaque breaks away from another area of the body and blocks a blood vessel in the brain (ischemic), or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts (hemorrhagic), thereby allowing blood to leak into an area of the brain and destroy it.3",

The study was initiated in 1949 by Thomas R. Dawber from the National Heart Institute. It involved about 50% of adult residents aged 30 to 62 years, a total of 5209 subjects in the small township of Framingham.

To provide a functional context for these findings, we trained Trpv1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice (n = 9 or 10/group) in a two-response operant discrimination procedure and measured detection thresholds to NaCl and KCl with and without amiloride. The KO and WT mice had similar detection thresholds for NaCl and KCl. Amiloride shifted the NaCl sensitivity curve to the same degree in both groups and had virtually no effect on KCl thresholds. In addition, a more detailed analysis of chorda tympani nerve (CT) responses to NaCl, with and without benzamil (Bz, an amiloride analog) treatment revealed that the tonic portion of the CT response of KO mice to NaCl + Bz was absent, but both KO and WT mice displayed some degree of a phasic response to NaCl with and without Bz. Because these transients constitute the entire CT response to NaCl + Bz in Trpv1 KO mice, it is possible that these signals are sufficient to maintain normal NaCl detectabilty in the behavioral task used here. Additionally, there may be other amiloride-insensitive salt transduction mechanisms in taste receptor fields other than the anterior tongue that maintain normal salt detection performance in the KO mice.",

Acids are the source of intrinsically aversive sour taste, but in mixtures with sweeteners they are consumed in large quantities. Recent results have provided fresh insights into transduction and sensory adaptation for the salty and sour taste modalities. The sodium-specific salt taste receptor is the epithelial sodium channel whereas a nonspecific salt taste receptor is a taste variant of the vanilloid receptor-1 nonselective cation channel, TRPV1. The proximate stimulus for sour taste is a decrease in the intracellular pH of a subset of acid-sensing taste cells, which serves as the input to separate transduction pathways for the phasic and tonic parts of the sour neural response. Adaptation to sour arises from the activation of the basolateral sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 by an increase in intracellular calcium that sustains the tonic phase of the sour taste response.",

In this study, a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm was used to examine whether 100 microM amiloride has a perceptible taste that could contribute to this observed decrease in behavioral responsiveness. Eighty-four C57BL/6J (B6) and 64 DBA/2J (D2) mice were divided into eight groups (n=8-12 per group), in which half received an injection of 0.15 M LiCl (2 mEq/kg) and the other half an equivalent saline injection, in three conditioning trials. The four conditioned stimuli were 100 microM amiloride hydrochloride, water, 0.1 and 0.3 M NaCl. Neither strain demonstrated acquisition of a CTA to amiloride in a brief-access (BA) taste test (5 s trials in the gustometer). Although 0.3 M NaCl is inherently aversive, its pairing with LiCl led to significantly further decreases in licking during the BA test on salt trials in both strains. The D2 strain clearly avoided 0.1 M NaCl, whereas avoidance of this stimulus was more equivocal in B6 mice. The inefficacy of amiloride to serve as a conditioned stimulus in taste aversion learning involving three LiCl pairings suggests that the effects of this ENaC blocker on taste-related behavioral responses to NaCl are likely due to its pharmacological interference with sodium taste transduction.",

Stimulation of the anterior tongue with salt solutions resulted in responses to halogenated sodium salts that were not eliminated by amiloride; approximately 30% of the halogenated sodium salt response remained after amiloride. In contrast, responses to nonhalogenated sodium salts were reduced to less than 4% of the original response after amiloride. To further learn of characteristics relating to the residual NaCl response, binary mixture and cross-adaptation experiments were accomplished. Responses to mixtures of sodium acetate or sodium bicarbonate with choline chloride were similar to responses elicited by equimolar concentrations of NaCl before and after amiloride. Moreover, NaCl and NaBr cross-adapted with choline chloride after, but not before, lingual application of amiloride. These experiments indicate that the residual response to halogenated sodium salts (e.g., NaCl) is related to the halogen itself, and from findings presented here, we propose one pathway for sodium taste transduction.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between cell volume and the neural response to acidic stimuli was investigated by simultaneous measurements of intracellular pH (pHi) and cell volume in polarized fungiform taste receptor cells (TRCs) using 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) in vitro and by rat chorda tympani (CT) nerve recordings in vivo. CT responses to HCl and CO2 were recorded in the presence of 1 M mannitol and specific probes for filamentous (F) actin (phalloidin) and monomeric (G) actin (cytochalasin B) under lingual voltage clamp. Acidic stimuli reversibly decrease TRC pHi and cell volume. In isolated TRCs F-actin and G-actin were labeled with rhodamine phalloidin and bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease-1 conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, respectively. A decrease in pHi shifted the equilibrium from F-actin to G-actin. Treatment with phalloidin or cytochalasin B attenuated the magnitude of the pHi-induced decrease in TRC volume. The phasic part of the CT response to HCl or CO2 was significantly decreased by preshrinking TRCs with hypertonic mannitol and lingual application of 1.2 mM phalloidin or 20 μM cytochalasin B with no effect on the tonic part of the CT response. In TRCs first treated with cytochalasin B, the decrease in the magnitude of the phasic response to acidic stimuli was reversed by phalloidin treatment. The pHi-induced decrease in TRC volume induced a flufenamic acid–sensitive nonselective basolateral cation conductance. Channel activity was enhanced at positive lingual clamp voltages. Lingual application of flufenamic acid decreased the magnitude of the phasic part of the CT response to HCl and CO2. Flufenamic acid and hypertonic mannitol were additive in inhibiting the phasic response. We conclude that a decrease in pHi induces TRC shrinkage through its effect on the actin cytoskeleton and activates a flufenamic acid–sensitive basolateral cation conductance that is involved in eliciting the phasic part of the CT response to acidic stimuli.",

The CT nerve innervating the anterior part of the tongue contained approximately equal numbers of two types of NaCl-responsive neurons; one type showed strong suppression of NaCl responses by amiloride [amiloride-sensitive (AS) type], and the other type showed only weak or no suppression of NaCl responses by amiloride [amiloride-insensitive (AI) type]. In contrast, the IXth nerve innervating the posterior part of the tongue has almost exclusively the AI type. This relative abundance of the AS and AI types of fibers was not altered by cross-regeneration of the two gustatory nerves into the reverse tongue regions. This suggests that regenerated taste axons selectively recouple with the appropriate type of receptor cell whether they innervate the front or the back of the tongue. Such selective synapse reformation may help explain the stability of response profiles of taste neurons during continual receptor cell turnover.",

In experiment 1, B6 and 129 mice were trained to associate consumption of a flavored solution (CS+) with intragastric (IG) infusions of 16% sucrose and a different flavored solution (CS-) with IG water infusions (22 h/day). They were then retrained with new flavors paired with IG infusions of 5.6% soybean oil and water. Although both strains developed preferences for the nutrient-paired CS+ solutions, the B6 mice displayed significantly stronger preferences. The B6 mice consumed more CS+ during training, which may have contributed to their enhanced preference. In a second experiment, training intakes were equated by giving B6 and 129 mice \"isosweet\" CS solutions prepared with different amounts of sucrose and saccharin. The B6 and 129 mice consumed more of the sugar- or fat-paired CS+ than the water-paired CS- during training. The two strains also displayed equally strong preferences for the CS+ over CS- in choice tests, indicating that they had similar postingestive responsiveness to the sucrose and soybean oil. We propose that B6 mice consume more sugar and fat than 129 mice because their stronger orosensory response stimulates greater intake, which leads to greater stimulation of postingestive nutrient detectors and further enhancement of consumption.",

It has been shown by others that amiloride, an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) blocker, significantly reduces the chorda tympani nerve response to lingually applied NaCl in C57BL/6 (B6) mice but not in DBA/2 (D2) mice, suggesting that the latter strain might not possess functional ENaCs in taste receptor cells. We psychophysically measured and compared taste detection thresholds of NaCl and sodium gluconate (NaGlu) prepared with and without 100 microM amiloride in these two strains (eight/strain). Mice were trained and tested in a two-response operant signal detection procedure conducted in a gustometer. Surprisingly, no strain effect was found for the detection thresholds of both salts (approximately 0.05-0.06 M). Moreover, these thresholds were increased by almost an order of magnitude by amiloride adulteration of the solutions. This marked effect of amiloride on sodium detection thresholds suggests that ENaCs are necessary for normal sensitivity to sodium salts in both strains. In addition, because NaGlu is thought to stimulate primarily the amiloride-sensitive pathway, especially at low concentrations, the similarity of NaCl and NaGlu thresholds (r > 0.81 both strains) suggests that ENaCs are also sufficient to support the detection of sodium in weak solutions by B6 and D2 mice.",

        "abstract": "The vanilloid receptor TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) is a cation channel that serves as a polymodal detector of pain-producing stimuli such as capsaicin, protons (pH <5.7), and heat. TRPV1 antagonists block pain behaviors in rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain, suggesting their utility as analgesics. Here, we report that TRPV1 antagonists representing various chemotypes cause an increase in body temperature (hyperthermia), identifying a potential issue for their clinical development. Peripheral restriction of antagonists did not eliminate hyperthermia, suggesting that the site of action is predominantly outside of the blood–brain barrier. Antagonists that are ineffective against proton activation also caused hyperthermia, indicating that blocking capsaicin and heat activation of TRPV1 is sufficient to produce hyperthermia. All TRPV1 antagonists evaluated here caused hyperthermia, suggesting that TRPV1 is tonically activated in vivo and that TRPV1 antagonism and hyperthermia are not separable. TRPV1 antagonists caused hyperthermia in multiple species (rats, dogs, and monkeys), demonstrating that TRPV1 function in thermoregulation is conserved from rodents to primates. Together, these results indicate that tonic TRPV1 activation regulates body temperature.",

Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 292: R37–R46, 2007. First published September 28, 2006; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00668.2006.— While summarizing the current understanding of how body temperature (Tb) is regulated, this review discusses the recent progress in the following areas: central and peripheral thermosensitivity and temperature-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) channels; afferent neuronal pathways from peripheral thermosensors; and efferent thermoeffector pathways. It is proposed that activation of temperaturesensitive TRP channels is a mechanism of peripheral thermosensitivity. Special attention is paid to the functional architecture of the thermoregulatory system. The notion that deep Tb is regulated by a unified system with a single controller is rejected. It is proposed that Tb is regulated by independent thermoeffector loops, each having its own afferent and efferent branches. The activity of each thermoeffector is triggered by a unique combination of shell and core Tbs. Temperature-dependent phase transitions in thermosensory neurons cause sequential activation of all neurons of the corresponding thermoeffector loop and eventually a thermoeffector response. No computation of an integrated Tb or its comparison with an obvious or hidden set point of a unified system is necessary. Coordination between thermoeffectors is achieved through their common controlled variable, Tb. The described model incorporates Kobayashi’s views, but Kobayashi’s proposal to eliminate the term sensor is rejected. A case against the term set point is also made. Because this term is historically associated with a unified control system, it is more misleading than informative. The term balance point is proposed to designate the regulated level of Tb and to attract attention to the multiple feedback, feedforward, and open-loop components that contribute to thermal balance.",

Because VR1 represents an attractive therapeutic target for conditions ranging from long-term pain to bladder hyperreflexia, we and other groups have sought to develop novel ligands with enhanced potencies and novel pharmacological properties. Here, we characterize two compounds, N-[2-(3,4-dimethylbenzyl)-3-(pivaloyloxy)propyl]-N'-[4-(methylsulfonylamino)benzyl]thiourea (JYL827) and N-(4-tert-butylbenzyl)-N'-[3-methoxy-4-(methylsulfonylamino)benzyl]thiourea (JYL1511), that function as partial agonists for rat VR1 heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both compounds showed substantially enhanced potency, inhibiting [3H] resiniferatoxin binding with Ki values of 29.3 +/- 7.6 and 50.4 +/- 16.5 nM, respectively, compared with 1810 +/- 270 nM for capsaicin. The compounds showed different extents of partial agonism, 6.8 +/- 0.7% and 17.4 +/- 0.6%, respectively, and the expected corresponding degrees of partial antagonism (93.9 +/- 0.9 and 84.1 +/- 3.2%, respectively). Their IC50 values for antagonism of 45Ca2+ uptake in response to capsaicin were 67.3 +/- 24.9 nM and 3.4 +/- 0.5 nM, respectively. Protons, temperature, and protein kinase C all function as coactivators/modulators of rVR1. All enhanced the extent of partial agonism of JYL827 and JYL1511. Thus, at pH 5.5, for example, the extents of partial agonism increased to 54.9 +/- 2.5% and to 90.7 +/- 1.7%, respectively, relative to the response elicited by 300 nM capsaicin. The extents of partial antagonism decreased correspondingly. Compounds such as JYL827 and JYL1511 now permit exploration of the potential utility of partial agonists of rVR1 in animal models. Our results emphasize, moreover, the strong dependence of such partial agonists on other modulators of rVR1 and predict that their biological behavior will depend strongly on biological context.",

Heterologously expressed VR1 can be activated by vanilloid compounds, protons, or heat (>43 degrees C), but whether this channel contributes to chemical or thermal sensitivity in vivo is not known. Here, we demonstrate that sensory neurons from mice lacking VR1 are severely deficient in their responses to each of these noxious stimuli. VR1-/- mice showed normal responses to noxious mechanical stimuli but exhibited no vanilloid-evoked pain behavior, were impaired in the detection of painful heat, and showed little thermal hypersensitivity in the setting of inflammation. Thus, VR1 is essential for selective modalities of pain sensation and for tissue injury-induced thermal hyperalgesia.",

Their effects on pH, aw, long chain free fatty acid and short chain fatty acid contents and compositions were studied. Sausages inoculated with L. plantarum 4045 had the lowest pH as a result of carbohydrate fermentation. However, release of free fatty acids was greater in the inoculated sausages than in the aseptic one. Lipolysis, measured as total content of long chain free fatty acids, occurred not only in the inoculated batches but also in the control, which could suggest that the meat endogenous lipases play an important role in t...",

To identify the molecules underlying that so-called kokumi sensation, a sensomics approach was applied on the water-soluble extract (WSE44) of GC44 by combining gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with analytical sensory tools. HPLC-MS/MS experiments on GPC fractions inducing a kokumi sensation when tasted in an aqueous biomimetic taste recombinant solution (rWSE44) enabled the identification of 8 alpha-L-glutamyl and 10 gamma-L-glutamyl dipeptides as candidate kokumi-enhancing molecules. Among those, only the gamma-L-glutamyl dipeptides were found to impart an enhanced kokumi sensation to the matured cheese, whereas none of the alpha-glutamyl peptides were found to be active. Among the gamma-L-glutamyl peptides, the candidates gamma-Glu-Glu, gamma-Glu-Gly, gamma-Glu-Gln, gamma-Glu-Met, gamma-Glu-Leu, and gamma-Glu-His, present in GC44 in concentrations between 4.11 and 17.66 micromol/kg, were identified for the first time as the key kokumi molecules enhancing mouthfulness and complex taste continuity of the matured cheese.",

        "abstract": "Temperate abalone species in aquaculture have a grow-out period of approximately 3 years because of their slow and heterogeneous growth rate. Abalone aquaculture is still a developing industry, and at least two major issues, nutrition and health, impede its development. Abalone are fed macroalgae on-farm in a number of countries, including China, Korea, South Africa and Chile. Formulated diets are crucial to the success of abalone aquaculture in countries where abalone do not grow readily when fed brown macroalgae or when access to macroalgae is insufficient for culture. Typically, the growth rate of abalone fed formulated diets is higher than abalone fed live macroalgae. However, due to a long production period, diets for abalone not only need to sustain high growth rates, but also maintain optimal health. Feeding live macroalgae improves the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone. In this review, the nutritional requirements of abalone and dietary ingredients used in formulated diets will be discussed, together with the use of dried macroalgal meal as a dietary ingredient in formulated diets to improve the feeding activity, health and marketability of abalone in commercial production.",

Marine carotenoids fucoxanthin and its two metabolites, fucoxanthinol and halocynthiaxanthin, have been shown to exhibit several biological effects. The antioxidant activities of these three carotenoids were assessed in vitro with respect to radical scavenging and singlet oxygen quenching abilities. The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity of fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol was higher than that of halocynthiaxanthin, with the effective concentration for 50% scavenging (EC 50) being 164.60, 153.78, and 826.39 microM, respectively. 2,2'-Azinobis-3-ethylbenzo thizoline-6-sulphonate radical scavenging activity of fucoxanthinol (EC 50, 2.49 microM) was stronger than that of fucoxanthin (EC 50, 8.94 microM). Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity as measured by the chemiluminescence technique showed that the scavenging activity of fucoxanthin was 7.9 times higher than that by fucoxanthinol, 16.3 times higher than that by halocynthiaxanthin, and 13.5 times higher than that by alpha-tocopherol. A similar trend was observed when the hydroxyl radical scavenging was assessed by the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. ESR analysis of the superoxide radical scavenging activity also showed the superiority of fucoxanthin over the other two carotenoids tested. Singlet oxygen quenching ability of the three carotenoids was lower than that of beta-carotene, with quenching rate constants ( k Q, x10 (10) M (-1) s (-1)) being 1.19, 1.81, 0.80, and 12.78 for fucoxanthin, fucoxanthinol, halocynthiaxanthin, and beta-carotene, respectively. The higher radical scavenging activity of fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol compared with halocynthiaxanthin is assumed to be due to presence of the allenic bond.",

The loss in nutritional quality and potentially in safety is attributed to destruction of essential amino acids, decrease in digestibility, inhibition of proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes, interaction with metal ions, and formation of antinutritional and toxic compounds. Studies in this area include influence of damage to essential amino acids on nutrition and food safety, nutritional damage as a function of processing conditions, and simultaneous formation of deleterious and beneficial compounds. These compounds include kidney-damaging Maillard reaction products, mutagens, carcinogens, antimutagens, antioxidants, antibiotics, and antiallergens. This overview covers the formation, nutrition, and safety of glycated proteins, characterized browning products, and heterocyclic amines. Possible approaches to inhibiting browning reactions and preventing adverse effects of browning during food processing and food consumption, including protection against adverse effects of heterocyclic amines by N-acetylcysteine, caffeine, chlorophyll, conjugated linoleic acid, lignin, and tea extracts, are also described. This research subject covers a complex relationship of the chemistry, biology, and pathology of browning products and the impact on human nutrition and health. Future study should differentiate antinutritional and toxicological relationships, define individual and combined potencies of browning products, and develop means to prevent the formation and to minimize the adverse manifestations of the most antinutritional and toxic compounds. Such studies should lead to better and safer foods and improved human health.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate an outbreak of sudden severe mortality in farmed abalone from coastal Victoria.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe outbreaks occurred almost simultaneously in three farms following abalone movements from the wild and between farms. The initial on farm investigation identified a number of features that when considered together were highly suggestive of an infectious aetiology. In many cases, dead abalone had no significant gross lesions. Others had swollen mouths and some had prolapse and eversion of the radula. Histologically, the lesions centred on the nerves innervating the labial apparatus, primarily the cerebral and buccal ganglia, cerebral commissure and peripheral nerve branches arising from these. Nervous tissue necrosis and haemocyte infiltration were the dominant lesions seen microscopically in affected nerves.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA recent outbreak of mortality in Australian abalone was associated with neurotropic lesions, which have not previously been described in this country. The on farm and between farm pattern of spread of the outbreak, a history of abalone movements linking farms, clinical observation of moribund and dead abalone were all highly suggestive of a virulent infectious agent.",

This document reviews various plant feedstuis, which currently are or potentially may be incorporated into aquafeeds to support the sustainable production of various ¢sh species in aquaculture. The plant feedstuis considered include oilseeds, legumes and cereal grains, which traditionally have been used as protein or energy concentrates as well as novel products developed through various processing technologies. The nutritional composition of these various feedstuis are considered along with the presence of any bioactive compounds that may positively or negatively aiect the target organism. Lipid composition of these feedstuis is not speci¢cally considered although it is recognized that incorporating lipid supplements in aquafeeds to achieve proper fatty acid pro¢les to meet the metabolic requirements of ¢sh and maximize human health bene¢ts are important aspects. Speci¢c strategies and techniques to optimize the nutritional composition of plant feedstuis and limit potentially adverse eiects of bioactive compounds are also described. Such information will provide a foundation for developing strategic research plans for increasing the use of plant feedstuis in aquaculture to reduce dependence of animal feedstuis and thereby enhance the sustainability of aquaculture.",

This study attempts to summarize recent data and to calculate the conversion efficiency of feed resources by Canadian farmed salmon in order objectively to assess the sustainability of this industry in this regard. Using updated information regarding domestic aquafeeds this review reports advances that have been made in diet formulation, fish in-fish out (FIFO) and feed conversion ratios (FCR) and demonstrates that production efficiency of farmed salmonids has significantly improved over time due to continued innovations in the aquafeed sector. The results suggest that the Canadian salmon aquaculture industry efficiently converts wild fish resources into high-value fish products.",

        "abstract": "Peptide hormones and their cognate receptors belonging to neuropeptide Y (NPY) family mediate diverse biological functions in a number of tissues. Recently, we discovered the presence of the gut satiation peptide YY (PYY) in saliva of mice and humans and defined its role in the regulation of food intake and body weight maintenance. Here we report the systematic analysis of expression patterns of all NPY receptors (Rs), Y1R, Y2R, Y4R, and Y5R in lingual epithelia in mice. Using four independent assays, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and RT PCR, we show that the morphologically different layers of the keratinized stratified epithelium of the dorsal layer of the tongue express Y receptors in a very distinctive yet overlapping pattern. In particular, the monolayer of basal progenitor cells expresses both Y1 and Y2 receptors. Y1Rs are present in the parabasal prickle cell layer and the granular layer, while differentiated keratinocytes display abundant Y5Rs. Y4Rs are expressed substantially in the neuronal fibers innervating the lamina propria and mechanoreceptors. Basal epithelial cells positive for Y2Rs respond robustly to PYY3–36 by increasing intracellular Ca2+ suggesting their possible functional interaction with salivary PYY. In taste buds of the circumvallate papillae, some taste receptor cells (TRCs) express YRs localized primarily at the apical domain, indicative of their potential role in taste perception. Some of the YR-positive TRCs are co-localized with neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), suggesting that these TRCs may have synaptic contacts with nerve terminals. In summary, we show that all YRs are abundantly expressed in multiple lingual cell types, including epithelial progenitors, keratinocytes, neuronal dendrites and TRCs. These results suggest that these receptors may be involved in the mediation of a wide variety of functions, including proliferation, differentiation, motility, taste perception and satiation.",

            "abstract": "The pancreatic polypeptide family includes pancreatic polypeptide (PP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and peptide YY (PYY). Members of the PP family regulate numerous physiological processes, including appetite, gastrointestinal transit, anxiety, and blood pressure. Of the multiple Y-type receptors proposed for PP family members, only the Y1 subtype has been cloned previously. We now report the cloning of an additional Y-type receptor, designated Y4, by homology screening of a human placental genomic library with transmembrane (TM) probes derived from the rat Y1 gene. The Y4 genomic clone encodes a predicted protein of 375 amino acids that is most homologous to Y1 receptors from human, rat, and mouse (42% overall; 55% in TM). I-PYY binding to transiently expressed Y4 receptors was saturable (pK = 9.89) and displaceable by human PP family derivatives: PP (pK = 10.25) PP (pK = 10.06) > PYY (pK = 9.06) [Leu,Pro]NPY (pK = 8.95) > NPY (pK = 8.68) > PP (pK = 7.13) > PP (pK = 6.46) > PP free acid (pK < 5). Human PP decreased [cAMP] and increased intracellular [Ca] in Y4-transfected LMTK cells. Y4 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in human brain, coronary artery, and ileum, suggesting potential roles for Y4 receptors in central nervous system, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal function.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in peripheral taste physiology now suggest that the classic linear view of information processing within the taste bud is inadequate and that paracrine processing, although undemonstrated, may be an essential feature of peripheral gustatory transduction. Taste receptor cells (TRCs) express multiple neurotransmitters of unknown function that could potentially participate in a paracrine role. Serotonin is expressed in a subset of TRCs with afferent synapses; additionally, TRCs respond physiologically to serotonin. This study explored the expression and cellular localization of serotonin receptor subtypes in TRCs as a possible route of paracrine communication. RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from rat posterior taste buds with 14 prime sets representing 5-HT(1) through 5-HT(7) receptor subtype families. Data suggest that 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(3) receptors are expressed in taste buds. Immunocytochemistry with a 5-HT(1A)-specific antibody demonstrated that subsets of TRCs were immunopositive for 5-HT(1A). With the use of double-labeling, serotonin- and 5-HT(1A)-immunopositive cells were observed exclusively in nonoverlapping populations. On the other hand, 5-HT(3)-immunopositive taste receptor cells were not observed. This observation, combined with other data, suggests 5-HT(3) is expressed in postsynaptic neural elements within the bud. We hypothesize that 5-HT release from TRCs activates postsynaptic 5-HT(3) receptors on afferent nerve fibers and, via a paracrine route, inhibits neighboring TRCs via 5-HT(1A) receptors. The ole of the 5-HT(1A)-expressing TRC within the taste bud remains to be explored.",

Two major subtypes of NPY receptor (Y1 and Y2) have been defined by pharmacological criteria. We report here the molecular cloning of a cDNA sequence encoding a human NPY receptor and the corrected sequence for a rat homologue. Analysis of this sequence confirms that the receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or human embryonic kidney (293) cells, the receptor exhibits the characteristic ligand specificity of a Y1 type of NPY receptor. In the 293 cell line, the receptor is coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein that mediates the inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation. In the CHO cell line, the receptor is coupled not to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase but rather to the elevation of intracellular calcium. These results demonstrate that second messenger coupling of the NPY-Y1 receptor is cell type specific, depending on the specific repertoire of G proteins and effector systems present in any cell type.",

            "abstract": "The pancreatic polypeptide family includes neuropeptide Y (NPY), one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the mammalian nervous system, as well as peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). This peptide family is involved in numerous physiological processes such as memory, pain, blood pressure, appetite, anxiety, and circadian rhythm. Of the multiple Y-type receptors proposed for PP family members, only the Y1 subtype was cloned previously. We now report the isolation of a human Y2 (hhY2) receptor cDNA by expression cloning from a human hippocampal cDNA library, using a 125I-PYY binding assay. hhY2 cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 381 amino acids with low amino acid identity to the human Y1 receptor (31% overall; 41% transmembrane). 125I-PYY binding to transiently expressed hY2 receptors was saturable (pKd = 10.17) and displaceable by human PP family members in rank order: PYY (pKi = 9.47) ∼ NPY (pKi = 9.27) PP (pKi < 6) and by peptide analogs: NPY2-36 (pKi = 8.80) ∼ NPY13-36 (pKi = 8.55) ∼ C2-NPY (pKi = 8.54) > NPY26-36 (pKi = 6.51) ∼ [Leu31,Pro34]NPY (pKi = 6.23).

To date, two peptides, cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal peptide, have been localized to subsets of taste-bud (TB) cells (TBC) and one, cholecystokinin, has been demonstrated to produce excitatory physiological actions. This study extends our knowledge of neuropeptides in TBC in three significant ways. First, using techniques of immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR, evidence is presented for the expression of a third peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY). Like other peptide expression patterns, NPY expression is circumscribed to a subset of cells within the taste bud. Second, using physiological studies, we demonstrate that NPY specifically enhances an inwardly rectifying potassium current via NPY-Y1 receptors. This action is antagonistic to the previously demonstrated inhibitory effect exerted by cholecystokinin on the same current, thus providing important clues to their signaling roles in the TB. Third, using the technique of double-labeled fluorescent immunocytochemistry, the relationship of three subsets of neuropeptide-expressing TB cells to one another was examined. Remarkably, NPY expressions, although fewer in number than either the cholecystokinin or vasoactive intestinal peptide subsets, overlapped 100% with either peptide. Collectively, these three observations transform previously suggestive roles of neuromodulation by peptides in TB cells to more concrete signaling pathways. The extensive colocalization of these peptides suggests they may be subject to similar presynaptic influences of release yet have antagonistic postsynaptic actions. The convergence or divergence of these postsynaptic actions awaits further investigation.",

In different regions, the mucosa shows adaptation to differing mechanical demands: Masticatory mucosa consists of a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium tightly attached to the underlying tissues by a collagenous connective tissue, whereas lining mucosa comprises a nonkeratinized epithelium supported by a more elastic and flexible connective tissue. The epithelium is constantly replaced by cell division in the deeper layers, and turnover is faster in the lining than in the masticatory regions. Chemotherapeutic agents and radiation limit proliferation of the epithelium so that it becomes thin or ulcerated; this will first occur in the lining regions. The principal patterns of epithelial differentiation are represented by keratinization and nonkeratinization. As keratinocytes enter into differentiation, they become larger and begin to flatten and to accumulate cytokeratin filaments. In addition to the keratins, the differentiating keratinocytes synthesize and retain a number of specific proteins, including profilaggrin, involucrin, and other precursors of the thickening of the cell envelope in the most superficial layers. The concept of epithelial homeostasis implies that cell production in the deeper layers will be balanced by loss of cells from the surface. There is a rapid clearance of surface cells, which acts as a protective mechanism by limiting colonization and invasion of microorganisms adherent to the mucosal surface.",

            "abstract": "Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gammaGCS), a rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis, plays a central role in glutathione homeostasis and is a target for development of potential therapeutic agents against parasites and cancer. We have determined the crystal structures of Escherichia coli gammaGCS unliganded and complexed with a sulfoximine-based transition-state analog inhibitor at resolutions of 2.5 and 2.1 A, respectively. In the crystal structure of the complex, the bound inhibitor is phosphorylated at the sulfoximido nitrogen and is coordinated to three Mg2+ ions. The cysteine-binding site was identified; it is formed inductively at the transition state. In the unliganded structure, an open space exists around the representative cysteine-binding site and is probably responsible for the competitive binding of glutathione. Upon inhibitor binding, the side chains of Tyr-241 and Tyr-300 turn, forming a hydrogen-bonding triad with the carboxyl group of the inhibitor's cysteine moiety, allowing this moiety to fit tightly into the cysteine-binding site with concomitant accommodation of its side chain into a shallow pocket. This movement is caused by a conformational change of a switch loop (residues 240-249). Based on this crystal structure, the cysteine-binding sites of mammalian and parasitic gammaGCSs were predicted by multiple sequence alignment, although no significant sequence identity exists between the E. coli gammaGCS and its eukaryotic homologues. The identification of this cysteine-binding site provides important information for the rational design of novel gammaGCS inhibitors.",

            "abstract": "Glutamate-cysteine ligase (γ-ECL) and glutathione synthetase (GS) are the two unrelated ligases that constitute the glutathione biosynthesis pathway in most eukaryotes, purple bacteria, and cyanobacteria. γ-ECL is a member of the glutamine synthetase family, whereas GS enzymes group together with highly diverse carboxyl-to-amine/thiol ligases, all characterized by the so-called two-domain ATP-grasp fold. This generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the Pasteurellaceae member Haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain Gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed GshF), as has been reported recently for the Gram-positive firmicutes Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes. Here, we show that yet another member of the Pasteurellaceae family, Pasteurella multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and GshF-driven biosynthesis. Domain architecture analysis shows that this P. multocida GshF bifunctional ligase contains an N-terminal γ-proteobacterial γ-ECL-like domain followed by a typical ATP-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known GS ligases. Recombinant P. multocida GshF overexpresses as an ∼85-kDa protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. The γ-ECL activity of GshF is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (Ki = 13.6 mm). Furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of GshF proteins.",

The functions of glutathione are manifold but notably include redox-homeostatic buffering. Glutathione status is modulated by oxidants as well as by nutritional and other factors, and can influence protein structure and activity through changes in thiol-disulfide balance. For these reasons, glutathione is a transducer that integrates environmental information into the cellular network. While the mechanistic details of this function remain to be fully elucidated, accumulating evidence points to important roles for glutathione and glutathione-dependent proteins in phytohormone signaling and in defense against biotic stress. Work in Arabidopsis is beginning to identify the processes that govern glutathione status and that link it to signaling pathways. As well as providing an overview of the components that regulate glutathione homeostasis (synthesis, degradation, transport, and redox turnover), the present discussion considers the roles of this metabolite in physiological processes such as light signaling, cell death, and defense against microbial pathogen and herbivores.",

            "abstract": "The genus Lactobacillus comprises 261 species (at March 2020) that are extremely diverse at phenotypic, ecological and genotypic levels. This study evaluated the taxonomy of Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae on the basis of whole genome sequences. Parameters that were evaluated included core genome phylogeny, (conserved) pairwise average amino acid identity, clade-specific signature genes, physiological criteria and the ecology of the organisms. Based on this polyphasic approach, we propose reclassification of the genus Lactobacillus into 25 genera including the emended genus Lactobacillus, which includes host-adapted organisms that have been referred to as the Lactobacillus delbrueckii group, Paralactobacillus and 23 novel genera for which the names Holzapfelia, Amylolactobacillus, Bombilactobacillus, Companilactobacillus, Lapidilactobacillus, Agrilactobacillus, Schleiferilactobacillus, Loigolactobacilus, Lacticaseibacillus, Latilactobacillus, Dellaglioa, Liquorilactobacillus, Ligilactobacillus, Lactiplantibacillus, Furfurilactobacillus, Paucilactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Fructilactobacillus, Acetilactobacillus, Apilactobacillus, Levilactobacillus, Secundilactobacillus and Lentilactobacillus are proposed. We also propose to emend the description of the family Lactobacillaceae to include all genera that were previously included in families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. The generic term 'lactobacilli' will remain useful to designate all organisms that were classified as Lactobacillaceae until 2020. This reclassification reflects the phylogenetic position of the micro-organisms, and groups lactobacilli into robust clades with shared ecological and metabolic properties, as exemplified for the emended genus Lactobacillus encompassing species adapted to vertebrates (such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensensii, Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus acidophilus) or invertebrates (such as Lactobacillus apis and Lactobacillus bombicola).",

            "abstract": "-Glutamylcysteine synthetase ( -GCS) and glutathione synthetase (GS), distinct enzymes that together account for glutathione (GSH) synthesis, have been isolated and characterized from several Gram-negative prokaryotes and from numerous eukaryotes including mammals, amphibians, plants, yeast, and protozoa. Glutathione synthesis is relatively uncommon among the Gram-positive bacteria, and, to date, neither the genes nor the proteins involved have been identified. In the present report, we show that crude extracts of Streptococcus agalactiae catalyze the -GCS and GS reactions and can synthesize GSH from its constituent amino acids. The putative gene for S. agalactiae -GCS was identified and cloned, and the corresponding protein was expressed and purified. Surprisingly, it was found that the isolated enzyme catalyzes both the ATP-dependent synthesis of L-glutamyl-L-cysteine from L-glutamate and L-cysteine and the ATP-dependent synthesis of GSH from L-glutamyl-L-cysteine and glycine. This novel bifunctional enzyme, referred to as -GCS-GS, has been characterized in terms of catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and inhibition by GSH, cystamine, and transition state analog sulfoximines. The N-terminal 518 amino acids of -GCS-GS (total Mr 85,000) show 32% identity and 43% similarity with E. coli -GCS (Mr 58,000), but the C-terminal putative GS domain (remaining 202 amino acids) of -GCS-GS shows no significant homology with known GS sequences. The C terminus (360 amino acids) is, however, homologous to D-Ala, D-Ala ligase (24% identity; 38% similarity), an enzyme having the same protein fold as known GS proteins. These results are discussed in terms of the evolution of GSH synthesis and the possible occurrence of a similar bifunctional GSH synthesis enzyme in other bacterial species.",

Ninety-one mucosal specimens from the ileum in 19 patients operated on for colonic cancer were studied in regard to intestinal barrier function, metabolism, electrophysiology and histology during 360 min of incubation in Ussing chambers. Steady-state permeability to 51Cr-EDTA was maintained for 120 min. Mucosal ATP and lactate levels were stable for 180 min and transmucosal glucose flux for 240 min. Lactate dehydrogenase leakage was limited within 120 min. Transepithelial potential difference was 9.0 +/- 3.0 mV at the start, and declined slowly throughout 360 min. Light microscopy revealed epithelial lifting from the basal lamina at 90 min. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated preserved ultrastructure for 120 min. Specimens with a transepithelial potential difference below 6 mV at the start were associated with increased 51Cr-EDTA permeability and lactate dehydrogenase leakage and more pronounced light microscopy changes. All studied parameters pointed to preserved viability if experiments were kept within a period of 90 min after equilibration. The few specimens with early viability derangement were identified by a transepithelial potential difference below 6 mV at the start. The Ussing chamber provides a tool for in vitro studies of human intestinal epithelium, including permeability. To minimize viability problems, experiments should be limited in time and monitored by measurements of transepithelial potential difference.",

Standard size forceps biopsies were taken from the descending part of duodenum from patients undergoing endoscopy. Short circuit current (SCC) and conductance (G) were measured during basal conditions and after addition of different sugars and secretagogues. Histologic examination was performed to determine the degree of tissue damage after study in the chamber. Basal SCC was 54.7 +/- 4.3 microA x cm(-2) and G was 58.7 +/- 4.7 mS x cm(-2) (mean +/- SEM, n=48) and steady values of these parameters were observed for at least 2 h. Reproducible and steady responses in SCC were obtained with D-glucose (SCCmax=172 +/- 22.1 microA x cm(-2); EC50=6.9 +/- 0.7 mM, n=5) and D-galactose (SCCmax=233 +/- 55.7 microA x cm(-2); EC50=9.2 +/- 0.7 mM, n=3), and secretory responses with 5-hydroxytryptamine, 100 microM (DeltaSCC= 16.1 +/- 3.8 microA x cm(-2), n=10), histamine, 100 microM (DeltaSCC=24.0 +/- 4.1 microA x cm(-2), n=10) and prostaglandin E2, 1 microM (DeltaSCC=30.3 +/- 5.4 microA x cm(-2), n=6). Experimental biopsy specimens showed intact surface epithelium by histologic examination and did not differ from controls apart from minor indications of edge damage. No difference in basal electrical parameters and D-glucose fluxes were found between Helicobacter pylori positive and negative patients. Our data suggests that the MUAS chamber represents a promising alternative approach to measure transport processes in intestinal endoscopic biopsies.",

In contrast to this scientific description, most people seem unaware that olfaction is involved in flavour perception. They also appear poorer at detecting the olfactory components of a flavour relative to the taste and somatosensory parts. These and other findings suggest that flavour may in part be treated as a unitary experience. In this article, I examine the mechanisms that may contribute to this unification, in particular the role of attention. Drawing on recent work, the evidence suggests that concurrent gustatory and somatosensory stimulation capture attention at the expense of the olfactory channel. Not only does this make it hard to voluntarily attend to the olfactory channel, but it also can explain why olfaction goes largely unnoticed in our day-to-day experience of flavour. It also provides a useful framework for conceptualizing how the unitary experience of flavour may arise from three anatomically discrete sensory systems.",

        "abstract": ": A Vietnamese fish sauce Nuoc mam used in the present study was rich in oligopeptides of which nitrogen content accounted for 20% of total nitrogen. The high-molecular-weight peptide fractions fractionated by ion-exchange chromatographies and ultrafiltration enhanced sweetness and umami as well as sourness and bitterness of the fish sauce, and increased several flavor characteristics including continuity, first taste and aftertaste. Thus, it is apparent that large amounts of peptides produced during the long-term fermentation of fish sauce are responsible for the complicated taste of the sauce. From each fraction, 17 peptides in total were isolated and determined for their amino acid sequences. These di-, tri- and tetra-peptides synthesized by solid- or liquid-phase method gave any one of bitter, sour, umami taste, or practically no taste in the absence of salt. In the presence of 0.3% NaCl, however, almost all peptides showed sweet and umami tastes. Other than these 17 peptides, there existed many other kinds of peptides in the fish sauce. Thus, these peptides are thought to contribute to the overall taste of the fish sauce.",

Examination with ion-exchange, thin layer and paper partition chromatographies showed that the dipeptides in I were more acidic, polar and hydrophilic than those in II, the bitter dipeptides (III) being rather hydrophobic. Similar tests for a brothy taste tripeptide, Glu-Gly-Ser, indicated that this possessed properties resembling I. O-Acetylation of the serine residue of Glu-Gly-Ser lessened its hydrophilicity and the taste became flat. The O-butyrylation resulted in a marked increase in hydrophobicity and the product showed a bitter taste.",

        "abstract": "Taste buds consist of at least three principal cell types that have different functions in processing gustatory signals: glial-like (type I) cells, receptor (type II) cells, and presynaptic (type III) cells. Using a combination of Ca2+ imaging, single-cell reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunostaining, we show that GABA is an inhibitory transmitter in mouse taste buds, acting on GABAA and GABAB receptors to suppress transmitter (ATP) secretion from receptor cells during taste stimulation. Specifically, receptor cells express GABAA receptor subunits β2, δ, and π, as well as GABAB receptors. In contrast, presynaptic cells express the GABAA β3 subunit and only occasionally GABAB receptors. In keeping with the distinct expression pattern of GABA receptors in presynaptic cells, we detected no GABAergic suppression of transmitter release from presynaptic cells. We suggest that GABA may serve function(s) in taste buds in addition to synaptic inhibition. Finally, we also defined the source of GABA in taste buds: GABA is synthesized by GAD65 in type I taste cells as well as by GAD67 in presynaptic (type III) taste cells and is stored in both those two cell types. We conclude that GABA is an inhibitory transmitter released during taste stimulation and possibly also during growth and differentiation of taste buds.",

            "title": "Amiloride-sensitive channels in type I fungiform taste cells in mouse",
            "abstract": "BackgroundTaste buds are the sensory organs of taste perception. Three types of taste cells have been described. Type I cells have voltage-gated outward currents, but lack voltage-gated inward currents. These cells have been presumed to play only a support role in the taste bud. Type II cells have voltage-gated Na+ and K+ current, and the receptors and transduction machinery for bitter, sweet, and umami taste stimuli. Type III cells have voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ currents, and make prominent synapses with afferent nerve fibers. Na+ salt transduction in part involves amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). In rodents, these channels are located in taste cells of fungiform papillae on the anterior part of the tongue innervated by the chorda tympani nerve. However, the taste cell type that expresses ENaCs is not known. This study used whole cell recordings of single fungiform taste cells of transgenic mice expressing GFP in Type II taste cells to identify the taste cells responding to amiloride. We also used immunocytochemistry to further define and compare cell types in fungiform and circumvallate taste buds of these mice.ResultsTaste cell types were identified by their response to depolarizing voltage steps and their presence or absence of GFP fluorescence. TRPM5-GFP taste cells expressed large voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents, but lacked voltage-gated Ca2+ currents, as expected from previous studies. Approximately half of the unlabeled cells had similar membrane properties, suggesting they comprise a separate population of Type II cells. The other half expressed voltage-gated outward currents only, typical of Type I cells. A single taste cell had voltage-gated Ca2+ current characteristic of Type III cells. Responses to amiloride occurred only in cells that lacked voltage-gated inward currents. Immunocytochemistry showed that fungiform taste buds have significantly fewer Type II cells expressing PLC signalling components, and significantly fewer Type III cells than circumvallate taste buds.ConclusionThe principal finding is that amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels appear to be expressed in cells that lack voltage-gated inward currents, likely the Type I taste cells. These cells were previously assumed to provide only a support function in the taste bud.",

            "abstract": "Salt taste in mammals can trigger two divergent behavioural responses. In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a non-selective detector for a wide range of salts. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities—sweet, sour, bitter and umami—are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCα in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice.",

Neurons in the geniculate (GG) and petrosal ganglia (PG) supplying the tongue were fluorescently labeled, acutely dissociated, and then analyzed using patch-clamp recording. Measurement of the dissociated neurons revealed that PG neurons were significantly larger than GG neurons. The active and passive membrane properties of these ganglion neurons were examined and compared with each other. There were significant differences between the properties of neurons in the PG and GG ganglia. The mean membrane time constant, spike threshold, action potential half-width, and action potential decay time of GG neurons was significantly less than those of PG neurons. Neurons in the PG had action potentials that had a fast rise and fall time (sharp action potentials) as well as action potentials with a deflection or hump on the falling phase (humped action potentials), whereas action potentials of GG neurons were all sharp. There were also significant differences in the response of PG and GG neurons to the application of acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5HT), substance P (SP), and GABA. Whereas PG neurons responded to ACh, 5HT, SP, and GABA, GG neurons only responded to SP and GABA. In addition, the properties of GG neurons were more homogeneous than those of the PG because all the GG neurons had sharp spikes and when responses to neurotransmitters occurred, either all or most of the neurons responded. These differences between neurons of the GG and PG may relate to the type of receptor innervated. PG ganglion neurons innervate a number of receptor types on the posterior tongue and have more heterogeneous properties, while GG neurons predominantly innervate taste buds and have more homogeneous properties.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding question in taste research concerns taste coding and, in particular, how broadly are individual taste bud cells tuned to taste qualities (sweet, bitter, umami, salty, and sour). Taste bud cells express G-protein-coupled receptors for sweet, bitter, or umami tastes but not in combination. However, responses to multiple taste qualities have been recorded in individual taste cells. We and others have shown previously there are two classes of taste bud cells directly involved in gustatory signaling: “receptor” (type II) cells that detect and transduce sweet, bitter, and umami compounds, and “presynaptic” (type III) cells. We hypothesize that receptor cells transmit their signals to presynaptic cells. This communication between taste cells could represent a potential convergence of taste information in the taste bud, resulting in taste cells that would respond broadly to multiple taste stimuli. We tested this hypothesis using calcium imaging in a lingual slice preparation. Here, we show that receptor cells are indeed narrowly tuned: 82% responded to only one taste stimulus. In contrast, presynaptic cells are broadly tuned: 83% responded to two or more different taste qualities. Receptor cells responded to bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli but rarely to sour or salty stimuli. Presynaptic cells responded to all taste qualities, including sour and salty. These data further elaborate functional differences between receptor cells and presynaptic cells, provide strong evidence for communication within the taste bud, and resolve the paradox of broad taste cell tuning despite mutually exclusive receptor expression.",

The compounds combine an 8-coordinate tetracarboxylate chelating site with stilbene chromophores. Incorporation of the ethylenic linkage of the stilbene into a heterocyclic ring enhances the quantum efficiency and photochemical stability of the fluorophore. Compared to their widely used predecessor, \"quin2\", the new dyes offer up to 30-fold brighter fluorescence, major changes in wavelength not just intensity upon Ca2+ binding, slightly lower affinities for Ca2+, slightly longer wavelengths of excitation, and considerably improved selectivity for Ca2+ over other divalent cations. These properties, particularly the wavelength sensitivity to Ca2+, should make these dyes the preferred fluorescent indicators for many intracellular applications, especially in single cells, adherent cell layers, or bulk tissues.",

Several transmitter candidates have been proposed for these synapses, including serotonin (5-HT), glutamate, acetylcholine, ATP, peptides, and others, but, to date, none has been unambiguously identified. We used Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing 5-HT2C receptors as biodetectors to monitor 5-HT release from taste buds. When taste buds were depolarized with KCl or stimulated with bitter, sweet, or sour (acid) tastants, serotonin was released. KCl- and acid-induced 5-HT release, but not release attributable to sweet or bitter stimulation, required Ca2+ influx. In contrast, 5-HT release evoked by sweet and bitter stimulation seemed to be triggered by intracellular Ca2+ release. These experiments strongly implicate serotonin as a taste bud neurotransmitter and reveal unexpected transmitter release mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Both amiloride-sensitive and -insensitive mechanisms contribute to NaCl taste transduction. The amiloride-sensitive mechanism relies on the epithelial Na(+) channel ENaC, which is widely expressed on the apical membrane of fungiform taste cells. The amiloride-insensitive mechanism, which predominates in circumvallate and foliate taste buds, was recently reported to involve a variant of the nonselective cation channel TRPV1. We performed 2-bottle preference and threshold experiments with TRPV1 knockout mice and wild-type (C57BL/6J) controls to test for NaCl preference and detection thresholds in the presence and absence of amiloride. Surprisingly, TRPV1 knockout mice not only detected NaCl in the presence of amiloride but they preferred NaCl over water at concentrations avoided by the wild-type mice. NaCl detection thresholds were between 2 and 3 mM for both genotypes. Amiloride increased the detection thresholds of wild-type mice but not knockout mice. The knockout mice also preferred 100 mM KCl compared with wild-type controls, suggesting that TRPV1 receptors may mediate a general aversive response to salts. Analyses of consumption data also revealed that TRPV1 knockout mice ingested more of the NaCl, with and without amiloride, and KCl solutions than the wild-type mice. However, comparisons of preference ratios and consumption volumes indicated that both wild-type and TRPV1 knockout mice avoided citric acid in quite a similar manner, suggesting that TRPV1 receptors do not mediate the detection of citric acid. These data, taken together, suggest that additional mechanisms must contribute to the amiloride-insensitive NaCl response.",

            "abstract": "1. Voltage-clamp and current-clamp data were obtained from a circumscribed region of the anterior rat lingual epithelium while simultaneously monitoring the afferent, stimulus-evoked, neural response from the same receptive field. 2. Chorda tympani (CT) responses at constant Na(+)-salt concentration were enhanced by submucosa negative voltage clamp and suppressed by positive voltage clamp. The complete CT response profile, including the time course of adaptation, was not uniquely determined by NaCl concentration alone. The response could be reproduced at different NaCl concentrations by applying a compensating voltage. 3. The form of the concentration and voltage dependence of the CT response indicates that the complete stimulus energy is the Na+ electrochemical potential difference across receptor cell apical membranes, and not Na+ concentration alone. This is the underlying principal behind the equivalence of chemical and electric taste for Na+ salts. 4. CT responses to sodium gluconate (25 and 200 mM) and 25 mM NaCl produced amiloride-insensitive components (AIC) of low magnitude. NaCl at 200 mM produced a significantly larger AIC. The AIC was voltage-clamp independent. The relative magnitude of the AIC was positively correlated with the transepithelial conductance of each salt. This suggests that the large AIC for 200 mM NaCl results from its relatively high permeability through the paracellular pathway. 5. Analysis of the CT response under voltage clamp revealed two anion effects on Na(+)-salt taste, both of which act through the paracellular shunt. 1) Anions modify the transepithelial potential (TP) across tight junctions and thereby modulate the cell receptor potential. This anion effect can be eliminated by voltage clamping the TP. 2) Sufficiently mobile anions facilitate electroneutral diffusion of Na+ salts through tight junctions. This effect is observed especially when Cl- is the anion and when the stimulus concentration favors NaCl influx, allowing Na+ to stimulate receptor cells from the submucosal side. Because the submucosal intercellular spaces are nearly isopotential regions, this effect is insensitive to voltage clamp of the TP. The large AIC associated with this anion effect is due to the low permeability of amiloride.",

That is, MSG, L-AP4 and aspartate have similar tastes to rats. However, conditioned taste aversion methods are unable to show to what extent the tastes of two substances are different. If two substances activate the same afferent processes (e.g. taste receptors), they are likely to produce the same tastes, but if they activate different afferent processes, the subject may detect differences between the tastes of the substances. In this study, rats were tested to determine if they could discriminate between the tastes of these agonists and MSG. We also established the detection thresholds for NMDA, aspartic acid and L-AP4, with and without amiloride (a sodium channel antagonist). Taste threshold values were 1-4 mM for NMDA and aspartic acid and 0.5-2.5 microM for L-AP4. None were affected by 30 micro M amiloride. Rats could readily distinguish between the tastes of MSG and NMDA but they had difficulty discriminating between the tastes of aspartic acid and MSG. Rats could also easily distinguish between 10-100 mM MSG and 0.01-5 mM L-AP4. However, in two separate experiments error rates increased significantly when L-AP4 concentrations were between 10-100 mM, indicating that the tastes of L-AP4 and MSG were similar at these concentrations.",

In vitro electrophysiological analyses indicate, however, that acid also activates capsaicin-sensitive and -insensitive vagal afferent nerves by a TRPV1-independent mechanism, and studies in anesthetized guinea pigs show that coughing evoked by acid is mediated by activation of capsaicin-insensitive vagal afferent nerves. In the present study, we have characterized the mechanisms of citric acid-evoked coughing in anesthetized guinea pigs. Drugs were administered directly to the Krebs buffer perfusing the extrathoracic trachea. Citric acid was applied topically to the tracheal mucosa, directly into the tracheal perfusate in increasing concentrations and at 1-min intervals. Citric acid dose dependently evoked coughing in anesthetized guinea pigs. This was mimicked by hydrochloric acid but not by sodium citrate. The coughing evoked by acid was nearly or completely abolished by TTX or by cutting the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Perfusing the trachea with a low Cl- buffer potentiated the acid-induced cough reflex. In contrast, prior capsaicin desensitization, 10 microM capsazepine, Ca2+-free perfusate, 0.1 microM iberiotoxin, 1 microM atropine, 10 microM isoproterenol, 10 microM albuterol, 3 microM indomethacin, 0.1 microM HOE-140, a combination of neurokinin1 (NK1; CP-99994), NK2 (SR-48968), and NK3 (SB-223412) receptor antagonists (0.1 microM each), a combination of histamine H1 (3 microM pyrilamine) and cysLT1 (1 microM ICI-198615) receptor antagonists, superior laryngeal nerve transection, or epithelium removal did not inhibit citric acid-evoked coughing. These and other data indicate that citric acid-evoked coughing in anesthetized guinea pigs is mediated by direct activation of capsaicin-insensitive vagal afferent nerves, perhaps through sequential activation of acid-sensing ion channels and chloride channels.",

Two putative taste receptors for glutamate have been identified, a truncated form of mGluR4 (taste-mGluR4) and the presumed heterodimer T1R1 + T1R3. Both receptors respond to glutamate when expressed in heterologous cells, but the G protein involved is not known. Galpha-Gustducin mediates the transduction of several bitter and sweet compounds; however, its role in umami has not been determined. We used standard two-bottle preference tests on alpha-gustducin knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice to compare preferences for ascending concentrations of MSG and MSG + 5'-inosine monophosphate (IMP). A Latin Square was used to assign the order of tastants presented to each mouse. Statistical comparisons between KO and WT mice revealed that whereas WT mice preferred solutions of MSG and MSG + IMP over water, KO mice showed little preference for these stimuli. Denatonium and sucrose served as control stimuli and, as shown previously, WT mice prefered sucrose and avoided denatonium significantly more than did KO mice. Naive mice were also tested, and while prior exposure to taste stimuli influenced the magnitude of the preferences, experience did not change the overall pattern of intake. These data suggest that alpha-gustducin plays a role in glutamate taste.",

However, the underlying mechanism for their action has not been delineated. Here, we investigated the effects of a kokumi taste active and inactive peptide fraction (500–10,000 Da) isolated from mature (FIIm) and immature (FIIim) Ganjang, a typical Korean soy sauce, on salt and umami taste responses in humans and rodents. Only FIIm (0.1–1.0%) produced a biphasic effect in rat chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve responses to lingual stimulation with 100 mM NaCl + 5 μM benzamil, a specific epithelial Na+ channel blocker. Both elevated temperature (42 °C) and FIIm produced synergistic effects on the NaCl + benzamil CT response. At 0.5% FIIm produced the maximum increase in rat CT response to NaCl + benzamil, and enhanced salt taste intensity in human subjects. At 2.5% FIIm enhanced rat CT response to glutamate that was equivalent to the enhancement observed with 1 mM IMP. In human subjects, 0.3% FIIm produced enhancement of umami taste. These results suggest that FIIm modulates amiloride-insensitive salt taste and umami taste at different concentration ranges in rats and humans.",

Based on our previous chorda tympani taste nerve recordings in rodents and human sensory evaluations, we proposed that N-geranylcyclopropylcarboxamide (NGCC), a novel synthetic compound, acts as a salt taste enhancer by modulating the amiloride/benzamil-insensitive Na+ entry pathways. As an extension of this work, we investigated NGCC-induced human TRPV1 (hTRPV1) activation using a Ca2+-flux signaling assay in cultured cells. NGCC enhanced Ca2+ influx in hTRPV1-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 115 µM). NGCC-induced Ca2+ influx was significantly attenuated by ruthenium red (RR; 30 µM), a non-specific blocker of TRP channels and capsazepine (CZP; 5 µM), a specific antagonist of TRPV1, implying that NGCC directly activates hTRPV1. TRPA1 is often co-expressed with TRPV1 in sensory neurons. Therefore, we also investigated the effects of NGCC on hTRPA1-expressing cells. Similar to hTRPV1, NGCC enhanced Ca2+ influx in hTRPA1-expressing cells (EC50 = 83.65 µM). The NGCC-induced Ca2+ influx in hTRPA1-expressing cells was blocked by RR (30 µM) and HC-030031 (100 µM), a specific antagonist of TRPA1. These results suggested that NGCC selectively activates TRPV1 and TRPA1 in cultured cells. These data may provide additional support for our previous hypothesis that NGCC interacts with TRPV1 variant cation channel, a putative amiloride/benzamil-insensitive salt taste pathway in the anterior taste receptive field.",

To provide a functional context for these findings, we trained Trpv1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice (n = 9 or 10/group) in a two-response operant discrimination procedure and measured detection thresholds to NaCl and KCl with and without amiloride. The KO and WT mice had similar detection thresholds for NaCl and KCl. Amiloride shifted the NaCl sensitivity curve to the same degree in both groups and had virtually no effect on KCl thresholds. In addition, a more detailed analysis of chorda tympani nerve (CT) responses to NaCl, with and without benzamil (Bz, an amiloride analog) treatment revealed that the tonic portion of the CT response of KO mice to NaCl + Bz was absent, but both KO and WT mice displayed some degree of a phasic response to NaCl with and without Bz. Because these transients constitute the entire CT response to NaCl + Bz in Trpv1 KO mice, it is possible that these signals are sufficient to maintain normal NaCl detectabilty in the behavioral task used here. Additionally, there may be other amiloride-insensitive salt transduction mechanisms in taste receptor fields other than the anterior tongue that maintain normal salt detection performance in the KO mice.",

            "abstract": "Salt taste in mammals can trigger two divergent behavioural responses. In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a non-selective detector for a wide range of salts. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities—sweet, sour, bitter and umami—are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCα in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice.",

Because excess sodium intake is associated with many health problems, it could be useful to have salt taste enhancers that are not sodium based. In this study, the regulation of NaCl-induced responses was investigated in cultured human fungiform taste papillae (HBO) cells with five arginyl dipeptides: Ala-Arg (AR), Arg-Ala (RA), Arg-Pro (RP), Arg-Glu (RE), and Glu-Arg (ER); and two non-arginyl dipeptides: Asp-Asp (DD) and Glu-Asp (ED). AR, RA, and RP significantly increased the number of cell responses to NaCl, whereas no effect was observed with RE, ER, DD, or ED. We also found no effects with alanine, arginine, or a mixture of both amino acids. Pharmacological studies showed that AR significantly increased responses of amiloride-sensitive but not amiloride-insensitive cells. In studies using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), responses to AR were significantly decreased in cells transfected with siRNAs against epithelial sodium channel ENaCα or ENaCδ compared to untransfected cells. AR dramatically increased NaCl-elicited responses in cells transfected with NHE1 siRNA but not in those transfected with ENaCα or ENaCδ siRNAs. Altogether, AR increased responses of amiloride-sensitive cells required ENaCα and ENaCδ.",

The effect of MRPs was investigated on human salt taste and on the chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve responses to NaCl in Sprague–Dawley rats, wild-type, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) knockout mice. MRPs produced a biphasic effect on human salt taste perception and on the CT responses in rats and wild-type mice in the presence of NaCl + benzamil (Bz, a blocker of epithelial Na+ channels), enhancing the NaCl response at low concentrations and suppressing it at high concentrations. The effectiveness of MRPs as salt taste enhancers varied with the conjugated sugar moiety: galacturonic acid = glucosamine > xylose > fructose > glucose. The concentrations at which MRPs enhanced human salt taste were significantly lower than the concentrations of MRPs that produced increase in the NaCl CT response. Elevated temperature, resiniferatoxin, capsaicin, and ethanol produced additive effects on the NaCl CT responses in the presence of MRPs. Elevated temperature and ethanol also enhanced human salt taste perception. N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamid (a blocker of TRPV1t) inhibited the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT responses in the absence and presence of MRPs. TRPV1 knockout mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response in the absence or presence of MRPs. The results suggest that MRPs modulate human salt taste and the NaCl + Bz CT responses by interacting with TRPV1t.",

In the tongue, TRPV1 expression has been reported also in the epithelium. This indicates a possibility that sensation is first received by the epithelium. However, how nerves receive sensations from the epithelium remains unclear. To clarify the anatomical basis of this interaction, we performed immunohistochemical studies in the rodent tongue to detect TRPV1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neural marker. Strong expression of TRPV1 in the epithelium was observed and was restricted to the apex of the tongue. Double immunohistochemical staining revealed that CGRP-expressing nerve terminals were in close apposition to the strongly TRPV1-expressing epithelium of fungiform papilla in the apex of rodent tongues. These results suggest that the TRPV1-expressing epithelium monitors the oral environment and acquired information may then be conducted to the adjacent CGRP-expressing terminals.",

In rats and WT mice, RTX increased the NaCl+Bz chorda tympani responses between 0.25x10(-6) and 1x10(-6) M and inhibited the responses above 1x10(-6) M. Decreasing taste receptor cell (TRC) [Ca2+]i with BAPTA loading, activation of PKC with 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (PMA), or inhibition of PP2B by cyclosporin A or FK-506, enhanced the magnitude of the Bz-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani responses in the presence of RTX and either minimized or completely eliminated the decrease in the chorda tympani response>1x10(-6) M RTX. In contrast, increasing TRC [Ca2+]i with ionomycin inhibited Bz-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani responses in the presence of RTX. No effect of the cited modulators was observed on the chorda tympani responses in WT mice and rats in the presence of TRPV1 blocker SB-366791 (1x10(-6) M) or in TRPV1 KO mice. 32P-labeling demonstrated direct phosphorylation of TRPV1 or TRPV1t in anterior lingual epithelium by PMA, cyclosporin A, or FK-506. PMA also enhanced the RTX-sensitive unilateral apical Na+ flux in polarized fungiform TRC in vitro. We conclude that TRPV1 or its variant TRPV1t is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by PKC and PP2B, respectively, and either sensitizes or desensitizes the Bz-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani responses to RTX stimulation.",

Assessments of the commercial promise of eight synthetic and eight natural non-caloric sweeteners are made relevant to these metrics. High-potency (HP) non-caloric sweeteners, both synthetic and natural, are generally limited in taste quality by (a) low maximal sweetness response, (b) \"off\" tastes, (c) slow-onset sweet tastes that linger, and (d) sweet tastes that adapt or desensitize the gustatory system. Formulation approaches to address these limitations are discussed. Enhancement of the normal sucrose sensory response by action of a sweetener receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM) has been achieved with very significant calorie reduction and with retention of the taste quality of sucrose. Research on PAM discovery over the past decade is summarized.",

            "abstract": "Salt sensing in animals involves the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). If ENaC were involved in human salt sensing, then the lingual surface potential (LSP) would hyperpolarize when exposed to sodium. We developed a chamber to measure the LSP while different solutions superfused the surface of the tongue and a technique to adjust for the junction potentials induced by varying salt concentrations. Changing the superfusion solution from rinse solution (30 mM KCl) to 300 mM NaCl (+30 mM KCl) caused the LSP to hyperpolarize by 10.1 +/- 0.7 mV (n = 13, P < 0.001). With repeated challenge the LSP response was reproducible. Increasing the Na concentration from 100 to 600 mM increased hyperpolarization by 35 +/- 4.8% (n = 9, P < 0.001). To examine whether amiloride affects the LSP, 0.1 mM amiloride was added to 300 mM NaCl; it reduced the hyperpolarization by 18.5 +/- 4.3% (P < 0.005, n = 11). However, the amiloride effect was not uniform: in six volunteers, amiloride inhibited the LSP by as much as 42%, while in five subjects, amiloride inhibited <5% of the LSP. In an amiloride sensitive volunteer, amiloride exerted 50% of its effect at 1 microM. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the LSP can be measured in humans, that Na hyperpolarizes the LSP, that increasing the Na concentration increases LSP hyperpolarization, and that amiloride inhibits the Na evoked LSP in some humans. While ENaC is involved in sensing salt, its role appears to vary among individuals.",

            "abstract": "Responses in the amiloride-insensitive (AI) pathway, one of the two pathways mediating salty taste in mammals, are modulated by the size of the anion of a salt. This “anion effect” has been hypothesized to result from inhibitory transepithelial potentials (TPs) generated across the lingual epithelium as cations permeate through tight junctions and leave their larger and less permeable anions behind (Ye et al., 1991). We tested directly the necessity of TPs for the anion effect by measuring responses to NaCl and Na-gluconate (small and large anion sodium salts, respectively) in isolated taste cells from mouse circumvallate papillae. Using calcium imaging, we identified AI salt-responsive type III taste cells and demonstrated that they compose a subpopulation of acid-responsive taste cells. Even in the absence of TPs, many (66%) AI salt-responsive type III taste cells still exhibited the anion effect, demonstrating that some component of the transduction machinery for salty taste in type III cells is sensitive to anion size. We hypothesized that osmotic responses could explain why a minority of type III cells (34%) had AI salt responses but lacked anion sensitivity. All AI type III cells had osmotic responses to cellobiose, which were significantly modulated by extracellular sodium concentration, suggesting the presence of a sodium-conducting osmotically sensitive ion channel. However, these responses were significantly larger in AI type III cells that did not exhibit the anion effect. These findings indicate that multiple mechanisms could underlie AI salt responses in type III taste cells, one of which may contribute to the anion effect. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding the mechanisms underlying salty taste will help inform strategies to combat the health problems associated with NaCl overconsumption by humans. Of the two pathways underlying salty taste in mammals, the amiloride-insensitive (AI) pathway is the least understood. Using calcium imaging of isolated mouse taste cells, we identify two separate populations of AI salt-responsive type III taste cells distinguished by their sensitivity to anion size and show that these cells compose subpopulations of acid-responsive taste cells. We also find evidence that a sodium-conducting osmotically sensitive mechanism contributes to salt responses in type III taste cells. Our data not only provide new insights into the transduction mechanisms of AI salt taste but also have important implications for general theories of taste encoding.",

            "abstract": "The bitterness of bitter substances can be measured by the change in the membrane electric potential caused by adsorption (CPA) using a taste sensor (electronic tongue). In this study, we examined the relationship between the CPA value due to an acidic bitter substance and the amount of the bitter substance adsorbed onto lipid/polymer membranes, which contain different lipid contents, used in the taste sensor. We used iso-α-acid which is an acidic bitter substance found in several foods and beverages. The amount of adsorbed iso-α-acid, which was determined by spectroscopy, showed a maximum at the lipid concentration 0.1 wt % of the membrane, and the same phenomenon was observed for the CPA value. At the higher lipid concentration, however, the amount adsorbed decreased and then remained constant, while the CPA value decreased monotonically to zero. This constant adsorption amount was observed when the membrane potential in the reference solution did not change with increasing lipid concentration. The decrease in CPA value in spite of the constant adsorption amount is caused by a decrease in the sensitivity of the membrane as the surface charge density increases. The reason why the peaks appeared in both the CPA value and adsorption amount is based on the contradictory adsorption properties of iso-α-acid. The increasing charged lipid concentration of the membrane causes an increasing electrostatic attractive interaction between iso-α-acid and the membrane, but simultaneously causes a decreasing hydrophobic interaction that results in decreasing adsorption of iso-α-acid, which also has hydrophobic properties, onto the membrane. Estimates of the amount of adsorption suggest that iso-α-acid molecules are adsorbed onto both the surface and interior of the membrane.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding question in taste research concerns taste coding and, in particular, how broadly are individual taste bud cells tuned to taste qualities (sweet, bitter, umami, salty, and sour). Taste bud cells express G-protein-coupled receptors for sweet, bitter, or umami tastes but not in combination. However, responses to multiple taste qualities have been recorded in individual taste cells. We and others have shown previously there are two classes of taste bud cells directly involved in gustatory signaling: “receptor” (type II) cells that detect and transduce sweet, bitter, and umami compounds, and “presynaptic” (type III) cells. We hypothesize that receptor cells transmit their signals to presynaptic cells. This communication between taste cells could represent a potential convergence of taste information in the taste bud, resulting in taste cells that would respond broadly to multiple taste stimuli. We tested this hypothesis using calcium imaging in a lingual slice preparation. Here, we show that receptor cells are indeed narrowly tuned: 82% responded to only one taste stimulus. In contrast, presynaptic cells are broadly tuned: 83% responded to two or more different taste qualities. Receptor cells responded to bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli but rarely to sour or salty stimuli. Presynaptic cells responded to all taste qualities, including sour and salty. These data further elaborate functional differences between receptor cells and presynaptic cells, provide strong evidence for communication within the taste bud, and resolve the paradox of broad taste cell tuning despite mutually exclusive receptor expression.",

Stimuli included various concentrations of NaCl, sucrose, HCl and quinine hydrochloride, and 0.5 M of six sugars. The inhibitory effects of amiloride on the responses to sodium salts, including various concentration of NaCl, 0.1 M sodium acetate and 0.01 M sodium saccharin, were also tested. Both the phasic and tonic responses to sugars in the GSP were significantly larger than those in the CT, whereas both responses to NaCl in the GSP were significantly smaller than those in the CT. Although amiloride at 50 microM significantly depressed the phasic and tonic responses to NaCl with a wide range of concentration in the CT, little inhibitory effect was observed in the GSP. The tonic response to sodium acetate, when dissolved in amiloride solution, was depressed to 15% of the control in the CT, and slightly but significantly depressed to 70% in the GSP. These response characteristics of the GSP may play important roles in the processing of gustatory information.",

Advanced taste sensors using artificial-lipid membranes have been developed based on concepts of global selectivity and high correlation with human sensory score. These sensors respond similarly to similar basic tastes, which they quantify with high correlations to sensory score. Using these unique properties, these sensors can quantify the basic tastes of saltiness, sourness, bitterness, umami, astringency and richness without multivariate analysis or artificial neural networks. This review describes all aspects of these taste sensors based on artificial lipid, ranging from the response principle and optimal design methods to applications in the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical markets.",

A 5.00 mM aqueous solution of glutamic acid monosodium salt was used as the standard solution. Sensor outputs were converted into EIT uma (estimated intensity of taste concerning umami) values. One unit on the EIT uma scale was defined as the amount of the sensor output corresponding to a difference in 1.2 times the concentration of the standard substance (glutamic acid monosodium salt). The umami taste intensity of green tea was classified into six grades on the EIT uma scale. Sensory tests proved that the EIT uma value had a high correlation to the human gustatory sense.",

            "abstract": "An improved formulation of the enteral nutrient Aminoleban EN (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), has been commercially available since Spring 2004. Like the previous formulation, the improved product contains branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) L-isoleucine (L-Ile), L-leucine (L-Leu), and L-valine (L-Val), but the average particle size of these amino acids has been increased to 180 to 250 microm in the improved formulation, compared with 40 to 90 microm in the old product. The improved formulation has a significantly lower bitterness intensity score than the older formulation, as evaluated both in human gustatory tests and using the artificial taste sensor. We propose that this improved taste masking is due to the larger particle size of the BCAA crystals, due to which their release rates are reduced. The addition of improved flavours has also helped to reduce the bitterness of the improved Aminoleban EN formulation significantly. Analysis of the taste sensor data suggests that the sourness and sweetness of the added flavours were critical in diminishing the bitterness of Aminoleban EN.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate an improved bitterness sensor which has been developed to allow the precise and sensitive prediction of the bitterness of acidic bitter pharmaceutical active ingredients, using as examples nine non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The bitterness of the nine NSAIDs was measured using a multichannel taste-sensing system incorporating a bitterness sensor, C00, which has a membrane surface with high hydrophobicity, and was developed to allow an enhanced hydrophobic interaction with acidic bitter substances. The sourness intensities of the nine NSAIDs were also determined in gustatory sensation testing and by a taste sensor using a sourness-sensitive membrane, CA0. The 'Change in membrane Potential caused by Adsorption' (CPA) of sodium diclofenac and etodolac were also determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of tartaric acid using membrane C00. Multiple regression analysis performed on the data on bitterness intensity obtained using the taste sensor and in gustatory sensation testing showed that CPA values from C00 could be used to predict the bitterness of the NSAIDs. The derived equation was y = -0.0413 × CPA + 0.3164, where y represents the predicted bitterness intensity. There were concentration-dependent changes in the bitterness intensities of diclofenac sodium and etodolac without any change in their sourness intensities. For diclofenac sodium and etodolac, there was a good correlation between predicted and actual bitterness intensities in the presence of increasing concentrations of tartaric acid. The taste sensor may be useful for predicting the bitterness intensity of acidic bitter pharmaceutical active ingredients such as NSAIDs.",

Stimuli were concentration series of sucrose, NaCl, HC1 and quinine hydrochloride (QHC1), and several other 0 1 M salts and 0 5 M sugars. For comparison, integrated responses were recorded from the chorda tympani (CT) nerve in many of the same animals from which recordings were made from the GSP. Responses in each preparation were scaled relative to the phasic response to 0.1 M NaCl and were then expressed for each nerve as a proportion of the total response magnitude (TRM)—the sum of all the responses to the four concentration series. In this way, the relative response of each nerve to all of the stimuli could be evaluated. There were significant differences between the GSP and CT nerves in the responses to NaCl, QHCI and sucrose. Both the phasic and tonic responses to sucrose were larger in the GSP than in the CT, whereas the tonic responses to NaCl and QHCI were smaller. The slopes of the concentration-response functions for NaCl, HCI and sucrose were significantly different between the two nerves. The responses to 0.1 M sodium and lithium salts were significantly greater in the CT than in the GSP; whereas the 0.5 M sugars elicited responses in the GSP that were 2—3 times greater than in the CT nerve. A comparison of the relative responsiveness to 0 3 M sucrose, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.01 M QHCI, 0.01 M HCI and distilled water among the GSP, CT, glossopharyngeal (IXth) nerve and superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) indicated that the vast majority of information about sucrose and NaCl is transmitted to the brainstem by the Vllth nerve.",

        "abstract": "Maillard reacted peptides (MRPs) were synthesized by conjugating a peptide fraction (1000–5000 Da) purified from soy protein hydrolyzate with galacturonic acid, glucosamine, xylose, fructose, or glucose. The effect of MRPs was investigated on human salt taste and on the chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve responses to NaCl in Sprague–Dawley rats, wild-type, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) knockout mice. MRPs produced a biphasic effect on human salt taste perception and on the CT responses in rats and wild-type mice in the presence of NaCl + benzamil (Bz, a blocker of epithelial Na+ channels), enhancing the NaCl response at low concentrations and suppressing it at high concentrations. The effectiveness of MRPs as salt taste enhancers varied with the conjugated sugar moiety: galacturonic acid = glucosamine > xylose > fructose > glucose. The concentrations at which MRPs enhanced human salt taste were significantly lower than the concentrations of MRPs that produced increase in the NaCl CT response. Elevated temperature, resiniferatoxin, capsaicin, and ethanol produced additive effects on the NaCl CT responses in the presence of MRPs. Elevated temperature and ethanol also enhanced human salt taste perception. N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamid (a blocker of TRPV1t) inhibited the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT responses in the absence and presence of MRPs. TRPV1 knockout mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response in the absence or presence of MRPs. The results suggest that MRPs modulate human salt taste and the NaCl + Bz CT responses by interacting with TRPV1t.",

            "abstract": "The effect of ethanol on the amiloride- and benzamil (Bz)-insensitive salt taste receptor was investigated by direct measurement of intracellular Na+ activity ([Na+]i) using fluorescence imaging in polarized fungiform taste receptor cells (TRCs) and by chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve recordings. CT responses to KCl and NaCl were recorded in Sprague-Dawley rats, and in wild-type (WT) and vanilloid receptor-1 (VR-1) knockout mice (KO). CT responses were monitored in the presence of Bz, a specific blocker of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). CT responses were also recorded in the presence of agonists (resiniferatoxin and elevated temperature) and antagonists (capsazepine and SB-366791) of VR-1 that similarly modulate the Bz-insensitive VR-1 variant salt taste receptor. In the absence of mineral salts, ethanol induced a transient decrease in TRC volume and elicited only transient phasic CT responses. In the presence of mineral salts, ethanol increased the apical cation flux in TRCs without a change in volume, increased transepithelial electrical resistance across the tongue, and elicited CT responses that were similar to salt responses, consisting of both a phasic component and a sustained tonic component. At concentrations <50%, ethanol enhanced responses to KCl and NaCl, while at ethanol concentrations >50%, those CT responses were inhibited. Resiniferatoxin and elevated temperature increased the sensitivity of the CT response to ethanol in salt-containing media, and SB-366791 inhibited the effect of ethanol, resiniferatoxin, and elevated temperature on the CT responses to mineral salts. VR-1 KO mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive CT response to NaCl and no sensitivity to ethanol. We conclude that ethanol increases salt taste sensitivity by its direct action on the Bz-insensitive VR-1 variant salt taste receptor.",

TRPV1 antagonists block pain behaviors in rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic, and cancer pain, suggesting their utility as analgesics. Here, we report that TRPV1 antagonists representing various chemotypes cause an increase in body temperature (hyperthermia), identifying a potential issue for their clinical development. Peripheral restriction of antagonists did not eliminate hyperthermia, suggesting that the site of action is predominantly outside of the blood–brain barrier. Antagonists that are ineffective against proton activation also caused hyperthermia, indicating that blocking capsaicin and heat activation of TRPV1 is sufficient to produce hyperthermia. All TRPV1 antagonists evaluated here caused hyperthermia, suggesting that TRPV1 is tonically activated in vivo and that TRPV1 antagonism and hyperthermia are not separable. TRPV1 antagonists caused hyperthermia in multiple species (rats, dogs, and monkeys), demonstrating that TRPV1 function in thermoregulation is conserved from rodents to primates. Together, these results indicate that tonic TRPV1 activation regulates body temperature.",

            "abstract": "Both amiloride-sensitive and -insensitive mechanisms contribute to NaCl taste transduction. The amiloride-sensitive mechanism relies on the epithelial Na(+) channel ENaC, which is widely expressed on the apical membrane of fungiform taste cells. The amiloride-insensitive mechanism, which predominates in circumvallate and foliate taste buds, was recently reported to involve a variant of the nonselective cation channel TRPV1. We performed 2-bottle preference and threshold experiments with TRPV1 knockout mice and wild-type (C57BL/6J) controls to test for NaCl preference and detection thresholds in the presence and absence of amiloride. Surprisingly, TRPV1 knockout mice not only detected NaCl in the presence of amiloride but they preferred NaCl over water at concentrations avoided by the wild-type mice. NaCl detection thresholds were between 2 and 3 mM for both genotypes. Amiloride increased the detection thresholds of wild-type mice but not knockout mice. The knockout mice also preferred 100 mM KCl compared with wild-type controls, suggesting that TRPV1 receptors may mediate a general aversive response to salts. Analyses of consumption data also revealed that TRPV1 knockout mice ingested more of the NaCl, with and without amiloride, and KCl solutions than the wild-type mice. However, comparisons of preference ratios and consumption volumes indicated that both wild-type and TRPV1 knockout mice avoided citric acid in quite a similar manner, suggesting that TRPV1 receptors do not mediate the detection of citric acid. These data, taken together, suggest that additional mechanisms must contribute to the amiloride-insensitive NaCl response.",

The apical ion channel is blockable by the diuretic amiloride, whereas the submucosal pathway is not. Sodium salts with small anions, such as NaCl, can stimulate submucosal as well as apical ion channels; sodium salts with large anions, such as Na-gluconate, activate primarily the apical channels. In humans, reports on the effects of amiloride on the taste of NaCl are conflicting and no data exist on the effects of amiloride on organic sodium salts. In the present experiment, subjects gave magnitude estimates of the total intensity and of each of the basic taste qualities for NaCl, Na-gluconate and KCl. Five concentrations of each of these stimuli were presented to the anterior tongue following distilled water adaptation and after amiloride treatment. There was a significant decrease in the total taste intensity of NaCl and Na-gluconate after amiloride, but no effect on KCl. The saltiness of all three salts was unaffected, but amiloride decreased the perceived sourness of the sodium salts. KCl sourness was unaffected by amiloride. There was a proportionately larger effect of amiloride on Na-gluconate than on NaCl, which is consistent with a larger role for the apical ion channel in Na-gluconate transduction. However, an appreciable amiloride-insensitive component is present for both NaCl and Na-gluconate, suggesting that an amiloride-insensitive pathway also plays a role in the transduction of both sodium salts. These data support the hypothesis that an amiloride-sensitive transduction component exists in humans, but suggest that it is considerably smaller than in many other species.",

Heterologously expressed VR1 can be activated by vanilloid compounds, protons, or heat (>43 degrees C), but whether this channel contributes to chemical or thermal sensitivity in vivo is not known. Here, we demonstrate that sensory neurons from mice lacking VR1 are severely deficient in their responses to each of these noxious stimuli. VR1-/- mice showed normal responses to noxious mechanical stimuli but exhibited no vanilloid-evoked pain behavior, were impaired in the detection of painful heat, and showed little thermal hypersensitivity in the setting of inflammation. Thus, VR1 is essential for selective modalities of pain sensation and for tissue injury-induced thermal hyperalgesia.",

Aqueous WPI suspensions were subjected to ultrasonic processing at different power levels (600–2000 W) and times (5–30 min), and then changes in the particle size, zeta (ζ) potential, and structure of WPI were investigated, and antioxidant activity of its hydrolysates was determined. The particle size of the particles of aqueous WPI suspensions was decreased after ultrasound, indicating that sonication destroyed protein aggregates. The ζ-potential values of a protein solution significantly changed after sonication, demonstrating that the original dense structure of the protein was destroyed. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated a change in the secondary structure of WPI after sonication, with a decrease in β-turn and an increase in α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil content. Two absorption peaks of WPI were generated, and the fluorescence emission intensity of the proteins decreased after ultrasonic treatment, indicating that the changes in protein tertiary structure occurred. Moreover, the degree of hydrolysis and the antioxidant activity of the WPI hydrolysates increased after sonication. These results suggest that HIU pretreatment is a potential tool for improving the functional properties of walnut proteins.",

            "abstract": "Walnut press-cake, a rich source of phenolics, is a by-product of walnut oil processing. In this study, the effects of walnut press-cake on cake quality, health-enhancing substances and antioxidant activity were determined. Wheat flour was replaced with walnut press-cake at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% levels. Results show that specific volume, firmness, resilience, cohesiveness, chewiness, crust a, b and crumb L, b values reduced with increasing walnut press-cake levels. However, polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols, total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of cakes increased. Antioxidant capacity measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays of cakes prepared with 20% walnut press-cake were 10.04- and 5.56-fold, respectively, greater than that of the cake without walnut press-cake. Cakes added with 15% walnut press-cake to wheat flour had the highest scores in all sensory parameters. Walnut press-cake can be successfully incorporated into cake formulation to improve sensory properties and antioxidant activity of the cake. \n \n \n \nPractical Applications \n \nInterest in walnut oil has increased during the past years due to its high polyunsaturated fatty acid content. Although walnut oil has been used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, there is no information about the use of walnut press-cake. Walnut press-cake is a rich source of bioactive compounds, and it is a new by-product with potential use in the baking industry as a supplement. The results of this study provide guidance for the use of walnut press-cake in the manufacture of cakes with higher sensory and nutritional quality.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in peripheral taste physiology now suggest that the classic linear view of information processing within the taste bud is inadequate and that paracrine processing, although undemonstrated, may be an essential feature of peripheral gustatory transduction. Taste receptor cells (TRCs) express multiple neurotransmitters of unknown function that could potentially participate in a paracrine role. Serotonin is expressed in a subset of TRCs with afferent synapses; additionally, TRCs respond physiologically to serotonin. This study explored the expression and cellular localization of serotonin receptor subtypes in TRCs as a possible route of paracrine communication. RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from rat posterior taste buds with 14 prime sets representing 5-HT(1) through 5-HT(7) receptor subtype families. Data suggest that 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(3) receptors are expressed in taste buds. Immunocytochemistry with a 5-HT(1A)-specific antibody demonstrated that subsets of TRCs were immunopositive for 5-HT(1A). With the use of double-labeling, serotonin- and 5-HT(1A)-immunopositive cells were observed exclusively in nonoverlapping populations. On the other hand, 5-HT(3)-immunopositive taste receptor cells were not observed. This observation, combined with other data, suggests 5-HT(3) is expressed in postsynaptic neural elements within the bud. We hypothesize that 5-HT release from TRCs activates postsynaptic 5-HT(3) receptors on afferent nerve fibers and, via a paracrine route, inhibits neighboring TRCs via 5-HT(1A) receptors. The ole of the 5-HT(1A)-expressing TRC within the taste bud remains to be explored.",

Dopamine neurons in mice lacking VMAT2 are unable to store or release dopamine from their synaptic vesicles. To determine how VMAT2-mediated filling influences synaptic vesicle morphology and function, we examined dopamine terminals from VMAT2 knockout mice. In contrast to the abnormalities reported in glutamatergic terminals of mice lacking VGLUT1, the corresponding vesicular transporter for glutamate, we found that the ultrastructure of dopamine terminals and synaptic vesicles in VMAT2 knockout mice were indistinguishable from wild type. Using the activity-dependent dyes FM1-43 and FM2-10, we also found that synaptic vesicles in dopamine neurons lacking VMAT2 undergo endocytosis and exocytosis with kinetics identical to those seen in wild-type neurons. Together, these results demonstrate that dopamine synaptic vesicle biogenesis and cycling are independent of vesicle filling with transmitter. By demonstrating that such empty synaptic vesicles can cycle at the nerve terminal, our study suggests that physiological changes in VMAT2 levels or trafficking at the synapse may regulate dopamine release by altering the ratio of fillable-to-empty synaptic vesicles, as both continue to cycle in response to neural activity.",

We combined functional calcium imaging with single-cell molecular profiling to demonstrate the existence of two distinct cell types in mouse taste buds. Calcium imaging revealed that isolated taste cells responded with a transient elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ to either tastants or depolarization with KCl, but never both. Using single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, we show that individual taste cells express either phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2) (an essential taste transduction effector) or synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) (a key component of calcium-triggered transmitter exocytosis). The two functional classes revealed by calcium imaging mapped onto the two gene expression classes determined by single-cell RT-PCR. Specifically, cells responding to tastants expressed PLCβ2, whereas cells responding to KCl depolarization expressed SNAP25. We demonstrate this by two methods: first, through sequential calcium imaging and single-cell RT-PCR; second, by performing calcium imaging on taste buds in slices from transgenic mice in which PLCβ2-expressing taste cells are labeled with green fluorescent protein. To evaluate the significance of the SNAP25-expressing cells, we used RNA amplification from single cells, followed by RT-PCR. We show that SNAP25-positive cells also express typical presynaptic proteins, including a voltage-gated calcium channel (α1A), neural cell adhesion molecule, synapsin-II, and the neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes glutamic acid decarboxylase and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. No synaptic markers were detected in PLCβ2 cells by either amplified RNA profiling or by immunocytochemistry. These data demonstrate the existence of at least two molecularly distinct functional classes of taste cells: receptor cells and synapse-forming cells.",

Human taste perception may be categorized according to four well-known and widely accepted descriptors, sweet, bitter, salty and sour (corresponding to particular taste qualities or modalities), and two more controversial qualities: fat and amino acid taste. The ability to identify sweet-tasting foodstuffs is particularly important as it provides us and other vertebrates with a means to seek out needed carbohydrates with high nutritive value. The perception of bitter, on the other hand, is essential for its protective value, enabling humans to avoid potentially deadly plant alkaloids and other environmental toxins. The focus of this review is on recent advances in our understanding of the transduction elements and signaling mechanisms underlying bitter and sweet taste transduction (see Figure 1). The sensations of bitter and sweet tastes are initiated by the interaction of sapid molecules ('tastants') with G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the apical membranes of taste receptor cells (TRCs). TRCs are specialized epithelial cells with many neuronal properties including the ability to depolarize and form synapses. TRCs are typically clustered in groups of ~100 within taste buds. The apical surface of TRCs, which makes contact with the oral cavity, is rich in convoluted microvilli containing GPCRs, ion channels and other transduction elements. The basolateral aspect of TRCs contains ion channels and synapses with afferent taste nerves.",

We have developed transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the PLCbeta2 promoter to enable one to identify these cells and record their physiological activity in living preparations. Expression of GFP (especially in lines with more than one copy integrated) is strong enough to be detected in intact tissue preparations using epifluorescence microscopy. By immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that the overwhelming majority of cells expressing GFP are those that endogenously express PLCbeta2. Expression of the GFP transgene in circumvallate papillae occurs at about the same time during development as endogenous PLCbeta2 expression. When loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye in situ, GFP-positive taste cells produce typical Ca2+ responses to a taste stimulus, the bitter compound cycloheximide. These PLCbeta2 promoter-GFP transgenic lines promise to be useful for studying taste transduction, sensory signal processing, and taste bud development.",

            "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) are essential for the survival of geniculate ganglion neurons, which provide the sensory afferents for taste buds of the anterior tongue and palate. To determine how these target-derived growth factors regulate gustatory development, the taste system was examined in transgenic mice that overexpress BDNF (BDNF-OE) or NT4 (NT4-OE) in basal epithelial cells of the tongue. Overexpression of BDNF or NT4 caused a 93 and 140% increase, respectively, in the number of geniculate ganglion neurons. Surprisingly, both transgenic lines had severe reduction in fungiform papillae and taste bud number, primarily in the dorsal midregion and ventral tip of the tongue. No alterations were observed in taste buds of circumvallate or incisal papillae. Fungiform papillae were initially present on tongues of newborn BDNF-OE animals, but many were small, poorly innervated, and lost postnatally. To explain the loss of nerve innervation to fungiform papillae, the facial nerve of developing animals was labeled with the lipophilic tracer DiI. In contrast to control mice, in which taste neurons innervated only fungiform papillae, taste neurons in BDNF-OE and NT4-OE mice innervated few fungiform papillae. Instead, some fibers approached but did not penetrate the epithelium and aberrant innervation to filiform papillae was observed. In addition, some papillae that formed in transgenic mice had two taste buds (instead of one) and were frequently arranged in clusters of two or three papillae. These results indicate that target-derived BDNF and NT4 are not only survival factors for geniculate ganglion neurons, but also have important roles in regulating the development and spatial patterning of fungiform papilla and targeting of taste neurons to these sensory structures.",

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed predominant expression of the receptor in circumvallate papillae. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that T1R3 was expressed in a subset of taste receptor cells in taste buds and that the topographic distribution of T1R3 in various taste papillae was different from those of the other T1R members. Genetic mapping of T1R3 with a mouse/hamster radiation hybrid panel located the gene on the distal end of mouse chromosome 4 correlated with the Sac locus affecting sweet sensitivity of mice. Our results indicate that T1R3 may serve as the receptor for sweet perception in mice.",

We recorded whole-cell responses of 120 taste cells of the rat fungiform papillae and soft palate maintained within the intact epithelium in a modified Ussing chamber, which allowed us to flow tastants across the apical membrane while monitoring the activity of the cell with a patch pipette. Taste stimuli were: 0.1m sucrose, KCl, and NH4Cl, 0.032 mNaCl, and 3.2 mm HCl and quinine hydrochloride (QHCl). When cells were held at their resting potentials, taste stimulation resulted in conductance changes; reversible currents >5 pA were considered reliable responses. Sucrose and QHCl produced a decrease in outward current and membrane conductance, whereas NaCl, KCl, NH4Cl, and HCl elicited inward currents accompanied by increased conductance. Combinations of responses to pairs of the four basic stimuli (sucrose, NaCl, HCl, and QHCl) across the 71–84 cells tested with each pair were predictable from the probabilities of responses to individual stimuli, indicating an independent distribution of sensitivities. Of 62 cells tested with all four basic stimuli, 59 responded to at least one of the stimuli; 16 of these (27.1%) responded to only one, 20 (33.9%) to two, 15 (25.4%) to three, and 8 (13.6%) to all of the basic stimuli. Cells with both inward (Na+) and outward (K+) voltage-activated currents were significantly more broadly tuned to gustatory stimuli than those with only inward currents.",

            "abstract": "The chincona alkaloid quinine is known to be a bitter tasting substance for various vertebrates. We examined the effects of quinine on isolated taste receptor cells from the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana). Membrane currents were recorded by whole-cell recording, while quinine hydrochloride was applied extracellularly from a puffer pipette. At the resting potential (-77 +/- 9 mV, mean +/- SD, n = 49 cells), taste cells generated inward currents in response to quinine stimulation (> 1 mM), indicating a depolarizing response in the taste cells. Two types of current responses were observed; a newly found quinine-activated cationic conductance and a previously reported blocking effect of quinine on K+ conductances. The cationic current was isolated from the K+ current by using a Cs(+)-containing patch pipette. The relative permeabilities (Pion) of the quinine-activated cationic conductance were: PNa/PK/PCs = 1:0.5:0.42. The quinine dose-response relation was described by the Hill equation with the K1/2 of 3.6 mM and Hill coefficient of 5.3. When extracellular [Ca2+] (1.8 mM) was reduced to nominally free, the conductance was enhanced by about sixfold. This property is consistent with observations on quinine responses recorded from the gustatory nerve, in vivo. The quinine-induced cationic current was decreased with an application of 8-bromo-cAMP. We conclude that the bitter substance quinine activates a cation channel in taste receptor cells and this channel plays an important role in bitter taste transduction.",

Because most poisonous plant alkaloids are intensely bitter, bitter taste warns animals of potentially hazardous foods. To investigate the mechanism of bitter taste transduction, a preparation of dissociated rat taste cells was developed that can be studied with techniques designed for single-cell measurements. Denatonium, a very bitter substance, caused a rise in the intracellular calcium concentration due to release from internal stores in a small subpopulation of taste cells. Thus, the transduction of bitter taste may occur via a receptor-second messenger mechanism leading to neurotransmitter release and may not involve depolarization-mediated calcium entry.",

This assertion is supported by six repeated measures of sucrose thresholds in each of 15 older (over 64 years) and 15 younger (under 27 years) adult subjects. Threshold was determined by a procedure similar to past studies and with the same results: much scatter and considerable overlap between the thresholds of younger and older subjects. A quite contrasting picture emerges, however, when each subject's six threshold determinations are averaged. Averaging shrinks the individual differences among subjects, as well as the over-lap between younger and older subjects. Although virtually all elderly subjects now revealed taste weakness, reliable individual differences in degree of weakness abound among them, suggesting various individual rates of physiological aging. In contrast, young persons exhibit greater uniformity of sensitivity. These findings were brought out by inter-test correlations, which were much higher for the older subjects; i.e. an older subject who tended to score high (low) on one test tended to score high (low) on the other tests. The study confirms the tenuous nature of brief threshold tests as indices of personal sensitivity as found earlier also in olfactory thresholds and in concurrent measurement of two-point touch thresholds in the present study. This revealed correlated losses between repeated taste and touch thresholds from the same 15 older subjects, unrelated to their exact chronological age.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in neural mechanisms of taste are reviewed with special reference to neuroactive substances. In the first section, taste transduction mechanisms of basic tastes are explained in two groups, whether taste stimuli directly activate ion channels in the taste cell membrane or they bind to cell surface receptors coupled to intracellular signaling pathways. In the second section, putative transmitters and modulators from taste cells to afferent nerves are summarized. The candidates include acetylcholine, catecholamines, serotonin, amino acids and peptides. Studies favor serotonin as a possible neuromodulator in the taste bud. In the third section, the role of neuroactive substances in the central gustatory pathways is introduced. Excitatory and inhibitory amino acids (e.g., glutamate and GABA) and peptides (substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) are proved to play roles in transmission of taste information in both the brainstem relay and cortical gustatory area. In the fourth section, conditioned taste aversion is introduced as a model to study gustatory learning and memory. Pharmacobehavioral studies to examine the effects of glutamate receptor antagonists and protein kinase C inhibitors on the formation of conditioned taste aversion show that both glutamate and protein kinase C in the amygdala and cortical gustatory area play essential roles in taste aversion learning. Recent molecular and genetic approaches to disclose biological mechanisms of gustatory learning are also introduced. In the last section, behavioral and pharmacological approaches to elucidate palatability, taste pleasure, are described. Dopamine, benzodiazepine derivatives and opioid substances may play some roles in evaluation of palatability and motivation to ingest palatable edibles.",

Monitoring the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ) response in circumvallate tissue homogenates upon stimulation with denatonium benzoate, it was demonstrated that a glutathione S-transferase-GRK3ct fusion protein-a Gβγ scavenger-attenuates the bitter tastant-induced second messenger reaction. Towards an identification of the Gβγ complex involved in rat bitter taste transduction, it was found that the G protein β 3 subtype is specifically expressed in taste receptor cells of circumvallate papillae. Gβ 3 -specific antibodies blocked the denatonium benzoate-induced IP 3 formation in a dose-dependent manner; the inhibitory effect was reversed by preincubation with the antigenic peptide. A less pronounced inhibition was observed using Gβ 1 -specific antibodies. Analyzing individual taste cells by single cell reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction approaches, overlapping expression patterns for PLCβ 2 , Gα gust , Gβ 3 and Gy3 could be demonstrated. Furthermore, the co-expression of all profiled signal transduction components in individual taste receptor cells could be detected. These data support the concept that the denatonium benzoate-induced IP 3 response is mediated by an activation of PLCβ 2 via a Gβγ complex, possibly composed of Gβ 3 as the predominant β subunit and Gγ 3 , and imply that multiple second messenger pathways may exist in individual taste receptor cells.",

The ability to find sources of sodium ions for managing electrolyte homeostasis relies on the activity of the taste system to sense salt. Several studies have been performed to understand the mechanisms underlying Na+ reception in taste cells, the peripheral detectors for food chemicals. It is now generally accepted that Na+ interacts with specific ion channels in taste cell membrane, called sodium receptors. As ion channels, these proteins mediate transmembrane ion fluxes (that is, electrical currents) during their operation. Thus, a lot of information on the functional properties of sodium receptors has been obtained by using electrophysiological techniques. Here, I review our current knowledge on the biophysical and physiological features of these receptors obtained by applying the patch-clamp recording techniques to single taste cells.",

            "abstract": "The recently discovered epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)/degenerin (DEG) gene family encodes sodium channels involved in various cell functions in metazoans. Subfamilies found in invertebrates or mammals are functionally distinct. The degenerins in Caenorhabditis elegans participate in mechanotransduction in neuronal cells, FaNaC in snails is a ligand-gated channel activated by neuropeptides, and the Drosophila subfamily is expressed in gonads and neurons. In mammals, ENaC mediates Na+ transport in epithelia and is essential for sodium homeostasis. The ASIC genes encode proton-gated cation channels in both the central and peripheral nervous system that could be involved in pain transduction. This review summarizes the physiological roles of the different channels belonging to this family, their biophysical and pharmacological characteristics, and the emerging knowledge of their molecular structure. Although functionally different, the ENaC/DEG family members share functional domains that are involved in the control of channel activity and in the formation of the pore. The functional heterogeneity among the members of the ENaC/DEG channel family provides a unique opportunity to address the molecular basis of basic channel functions such as activation by ligands, mechanotransduction, ionic selectivity, or block by pharmacological ligands.",

        "abstract": "In addition to their well-known preference for sugars, mice and rats avidly consume starch-derived glucose polymers (e.g., Polycose). T1R3 is a component of the mammalian sweet taste receptor that mediates the preference for sugars and artificial sweeteners in mammals. We examined the role of the T1R3 receptor in the ingestive response of mice to Polycose and sucrose. In 60-s two-bottle tests, knockout (KO) mice preferred Polycose solutions (4-32%) to water, although their overall preference was lower than WT mice (82% vs. 94%). KO mice also preferred Polycose (0.5-32%) in 24-h two-bottle tests, although less so than WT mice at dilute concentrations (0.5-4%). In contrast, KO mice failed to prefer sucrose to water in 60-s tests. In 24-h tests, KO mice were indifferent to 0.5-8% sucrose, but preferred 16-32% sucrose; this latter result may reflect the post-oral effects of sucrose. Overall sucrose preference and intake were substantially less in KO mice than WT mice. However, when retested with 0.5-32% sucrose solutions, the KO mice preferred all sucrose concentrations, although they drank less sugar than WT mice. The experience-induced sucrose preference is attributed to a post-oral conditioned preference for the T1R3-independent orosensory features of the sugar solutions (odor, texture, T1R2-mediated taste). Chorda tympani nerve recordings revealed virtually no response to sucrose in KO mice, but a near-normal response to Polycose. These results indicate that the T1R3 receptor plays a critical role in the taste-mediated response to sucrose but not Polycose.",

We assessed the affective potency of these compounds along with glycine, which is thought to bind with both T1R receptor complexes, using a brief-access taste test in a gustometer. Unconditioned licking responses of two 'taster' strains (C57BL/6J and SWR/J), which display high preference for low concentrations of sucrose, and two 'non-taster' (129P3/J and DBA/2J) strains, which display blunted preference for low concentrations of sucrose, were measured during 5 s trials of varying concentrations of a single compound when mice (n=10/strain/stimulus) were non-deprived and when access to home-cage water was restricted. In non-deprived mice, sucrose generated monotonically increasing concentration-response curves regardless of strain, whereas glycine was only marginally effective at stimulating licking and L-serine produced relatively flat functions. The profile of responsiveness across strains was more complex than expected. For example, when tested with sucrose in the non-deprived condition, the 129P3/J non-taster strain surpassed the responsiveness of taster mice at mid-range to high concentrations. Under water-restricted conditions, these mice also were significantly more responsive to high concentrations of both sucrose and glycine compared with the other strains when stimulus licking was standardized relative to water. Thus, the affective potency of the stimuli tested here seems to be related to the ability of the compounds to bind with the T1R2+3 receptor complex. However, the profile of strain responsiveness to these tastants in the brief-access test does not appear to be simply explained by the sweetener 'taster' status of the strain.",

Progress with understanding how T1R and T2R receptors interact with taste stimuli and with identifying their patterns of expression in taste cells sheds light on coding of taste information by the nervous system. Candidate mechanisms for detection of salts, acids, fat, complex carbohydrates, and water have also been proposed, but further studies are needed to prove their identity.",

Genetic and physical mapping limited a critical genomic interval containing Sac to a 194 kb DNA fragment. Sequencing and annotation of this region identified a gene (Tas1r3) encoding the third member of the T1R family of putative taste receptors, T1R3. Introgression by serial backcrossing of the 194 kb chromosomal fragment containing the Tas1r3 allele from the high-sweetener-preferring C57BL/6ByJ strain onto the genetic background of the low-sweetener-preferring 129P3/J strain rescued its low-sweetener-preference phenotype. Polymorphisms of Tas1r3 that are likely to have functional significance were identified using analysis of genomic sequences and sweetener-preference phenotypes of genealogically distant mouse strains. Tas1r3 has two common haplotypes, consisting of six single nucleotide polymorphisms: one haplotype was found in mouse strains with elevated sweetener preference and the other in strains relatively indifferent to sweeteners. This study provides compelling evidence that Tas1r3 is equivalent to the Sac locus and that the T1R3 receptor responds to sweeteners.",

First, transgenic mice lacking the gene for T1R3, Tas1r3, show dramatically reduced lick responsiveness to most sweeteners. Second, strains with the taster allele of Tas1r3 (T strains) are more sensitive to low sweetener concentrations than strains with the nontaster allele (NT strains) and consume greater quantities of low- to midrange concentrations of sweeteners during 24-h tests. We asked how Tas1r3 polymorphisms influence the initial licking responses of four T strains (FVB/NJ, SWR/J, SM/J, and C57BL/6J) and four NT strains (BALB/cJ, 129P3/J, DBA/2J, and C3H/HeJ) to two sweeteners (sucrose and SC-45647, an artificial sweetener). We used the initial licking response as a measure of the taste-mediated ingestive response because its brief duration minimizes the potential contribution of nontaste factors (e.g., negative and positive postingestive feedback). Further, we used two complimentary short-term intake tests (the brief-access taste test and a novel 1-min preference test) to reduce the possibility that our findings were an epiphenomenon of a specific testing procedure. In both tests, the T strains were more responsive than the NT strains to low concentrations of each sweetener. At higher concentrations, however, there was considerable overlap between the T and NT strains. In fact, the initial licking response of several NT strains was more vigorous than (or equivalent to) that of several T strains. There was also considerable variation among strains with the same Tas1r3 allele. We conclude that Tas1r3 polymorphisms contribute to strain differences in initial lick responsiveness to low but not high concentrations of sweeteners.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that the T1R3 receptor protein encoded by the Tas1r3 gene is involved in transduction of sweet taste. To assess ligand specificity of the T1R3 receptor, we analyzed the association of Tas1r3 allelic variants with taste responses in mice. In the F2 hybrids between the C57BL/6ByJ (B6) and 129P3/J (129) inbred mouse strains, we determined genotypes of markers on chromosome 4, where Tas1r3 resides, measured consumption of taste solutions presented in two-bottle preference tests, and recorded integrated responses of the chorda tympani gustatory nerve to lingual application of taste stimuli. For intakes and preferences, significant linkages to Tas1r3 were found for the sweeteners sucrose, saccharin, and d-phenylalanine but not glycine. For chorda tympani responses, significant linkages to Tas1r3 were found for the sweeteners sucrose, saccharin, d-phenylalanine, d-tryptophan, and SC-45647 but not glycine, l-proline, l-alanine, or l-glutamine. No linkages to distal chromosome 4 were detected for behavioral or neural responses to non-sweet quinine, citric acid, HCl, NaCl, KCl, monosodium glutamate, inosine 5′-monophosphate, or ammonium glutamate. These results demonstrate that allelic variation of the Tas1r3 gene affects gustatory neural and behavioral responses to some, but not all, sweeteners. This study describes the range of ligand sensitivity of the T1R3 receptor using an in vivo approach and, to our knowledge, is the first genetic mapping study of activity in gustatory nerves.",

        "abstract": "Taste receptor cells (TRCs) respond to acid stimulation, initiating perception of sour taste. Paradoxically, the pH of weak acidic stimuli correlates poorly with the perception of their sourness. A fundamental issue surrounding sour taste reception is the identity of the sour stimulus. We tested the hypothesis that acids induce sour taste perception by penetrating plasma membranes as H(+) ions or as undissociated molecules and decreasing the intracellular pH (pH(i)) of TRCs. Our data suggest that taste nerve responses to weak acids (acetic acid and CO(2)) are independent of stimulus pH but strongly correlate with the intracellular acidification of polarized TRCs. Taste nerve responses to CO(2) were voltage sensitive and were blocked with MK-417, a specific blocker of carbonic anhydrase. Strong acids (HCl) decrease pH(i) in a subset of TRCs that contain a pathway for H(+) entry. Both the apical membrane and the paracellular shunt pathway restrict H(+) entry such that a large decrease in apical pH is translated into a relatively small change in TRC pH(i) within the physiological range. We conclude that a decrease in TRC pH(i) is the proximate stimulus in rat sour taste transduction.",

            "abstract": "To test whether undissociated acid is capable of exciting the chorda tympani nerves in rats, we have used buffered acid solutions as taste stimuli. These solutions were prepared by adding alkali to weak acids, such as acetic acid, so that the proportion of undissociated and dissociated acids was varied whereas keeping the total acid concentration constant. When acetic acid solutions, adjusted to wide ranges of pH by NaOH, were applied to the tongue, the response magnitude of the chorda tympani nerves was not varied systematically with pH changes. However, if the sodium effect was eliminated by amiloride or replacement of cation by potassium or Tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane; NH(2)C(CH(2)OH)(3) (Tris-base), the chorda tympani response was reduced systematically as pH increased. Similar results were obtained with citric acid and ascorbic acid. This pH-dependent change in taste nerve response to acid cannot be solely attributed to the proton gradient because the response magnitude induced by hydrogen itself, which was estimated from responses to strong acids, was much smaller than that by equi-pH acetic acid ( approximately 85%). Thus we cannot explain the pH-dependent responses of the chorda tympani nerves to weak acids unless effects of undissociated acid molecules are postulated. It is therefore concluded that undissociated acids in weak acid solutions can be a stimulant to taste receptor cells.",

Topical MK-417 (pKa 5.8, 8.3), a close congener of MK-507 (Dorzolamide) was given as a 1.4% solution at pH 4.5 (n=6) and pH 9.2 (n=6). MK-417 was instilled to the left eye with the right eye used as an untreated control. One hour later methazolamide was given intravenously at 10 mg/kg, a dose known to give full inhibition of the enzyme. Control IOP (mm Hg) was 19.12+/-0.50. One hour following MK-417, the left eye IOP was 13.40 +/-0.70 (pH 4.5) and 13.25+/-0.70 (pH 9.2). The right eye pressure was unchanged. Methazolamide injection at this time gave no further drop in the left eye IOP at either pH. IOP in the right eye fell to 14.00+/-0.70 so that 2 hours after methazolamide injection, the 2 eyes had the same pressure. In conclusion, topical CAI in sufficient dose and correct pH yields IOP lowering equivalent to a maximally effective dose of systemic CAI in rabbits.",

Light scatter from colonic tissue caused SNARF-1 or LY fluorescence to decrease 3% per micrometer focal distance into tissue at both 640- and 580-nm emission wavelengths. However, dual emission ratios of LY fluorescence were constant as a function of focal distance into tissue or in the presence of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). SCFA, known to cause changes in extracellular pH, cause maximal changes in crypt luminal pH at 10 microns from the crypt base. Maximal changes of pH in lamina propria occur higher along the crypt-to-surface axis than maximal changes in luminal pH. Lateral intercellular spaces between colonocytes are a separate microdomain in which pH is constant in absence vs. presence of SCFA and along the base-to-apex axis of colonocytes.",

            "abstract": "We examined the sour taste transduction mechanism in the mouse by applying whole cell patch-clamp technique to nondissociated taste cells from the fungiform papillae. Localized stimulation with 0.5 M NaCl and 25 mM citric acid (pH 3.0) of the apical membrane enabled us to obtain responses from single taste cells under a quasi-natural condition. Of 28 taste cells examined, 11 cells (39%) responded to 0. 5 M NaCl alone and 2 cells (7%) responded to 25 mM citric acid alone, indicating the presence of salty- and sour-specific taste cells. Ten cells (36%) responded to both NaCl and citric acid and 5 cells (18%) responded to neither salt nor citric acid. Amiloride reversibly suppressed NaCl-induced responses in mouse taste cells but not citric acid-induced responses. On the other hand, a Cl- channel blocker, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB), reversibly suppressed all the citric-acid-induced responses. Most of the NaCl-induced current responses displayed an inwardly rectifying property, whereas all the citric-acid-induced responses displayed an outwardly rectifying property. The reversal potential for NPPB-sensitive component in citric-acid-induced current responses was -2 +/- 7 mV (mean +/- SE, n = 4), which was close to the equilibrium potential of Cl- (ECl), whereas the reversal potential for NPPB-insensitive component was 34 +/- 8 mV (n = 4). The reversal potential of citric-acid-induced current responses (19 +/- 8 mV, n = 4) was mostly present at the middle point between reversal potentials of NPPB-sensitive and -insensitive current components. In some taste cells, an inorganic cation channel blocker, Cd2+, suppressed citric-acid-induced responses, but an inorganic stretch-activated cation channel blocker, Gd3+, did not affect these responses. These results suggest that salt- and acid-induced responses were mediated by differential transduction mechanisms in mouse taste cells and that NPPB-sensitive Cl- channels play a more important role to sour taste transduction rather than amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels. However, the fact that the reversal potentials of citric-acid-induced responses had more positive than ECl suggests that Ca2+ or H+ permeable and poorly selective cation channels, which should be amiloride insensitive, may be activated by citric acid.",

The characterization of the cloned transporter isoforms in a suitable expression system is nevertheless still lacking. H+/monocarboxylate co-transport was therefore investigated in monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes by using pH-sensitive microelectrodes and [14C]lactate. Superfusion with lactate resulted in intracellular acidification of MCT1-expressing oocytes, but not in non-injected control oocytes. The basic kinetic properties of lactate transport in MCT1-expressing oocytes were determined by analysing the rates of intracellular pH changes under different conditions. The results were in agreement with the known properties of the transporter, with respect to both the dependence on the lactate concentration and the external pH value. Besides lactate, MCT1 mediated the reversible transport of a wide variety of monocarboxylic acids including pyruvate, D,L-3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, alpha-oxoisohexanoate and alpha-oxoisovalerate, but not of dicarboxylic and tricarboxylic acids. The inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate bound strongly to the transporter without being translocated, but could be displaced by the addition of lactate. In addition to changes in the intracellular pH, lactate transport also induced deviations from the resting membrane potential.",

Rats in the fourth group (receiving 33.7 mg zinc/kg) were pair-fed against the zinc-deficient rats. Biochemical analysis at the end of the experimental period indicated that zinc deficiency significantly reduced CA activity in the tongue epithelium and submandibular gland, and the CA activity levels in these tissues seemed to parallel the dietary zinc levels. By enzyme histochemistry, an intensely positive reaction for CA was observed in the middle and basal regions of the taste buds in the circumvallate papilla in the zinc-sufficient and pair-fed (control) rats. The cells in von Ebner's glands also showed a strong positive reaction in control rats, although only a weak reaction product was found in zinc-deficient rats. These results suggest that CA activity is affected by the dietary content of zinc, which is considered to be an indispensable factor for the maintenance of normal taste sensation.",

        "abstract": "The effect of ethanol on the amiloride- and benzamil (Bz)-insensitive salt taste receptor was investigated by direct measurement of intracellular Na+ activity ([Na+]i) using fluorescence imaging in polarized fungiform taste receptor cells (TRCs) and by chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve recordings. CT responses to KCl and NaCl were recorded in Sprague-Dawley rats, and in wild-type (WT) and vanilloid receptor-1 (VR-1) knockout mice (KO). CT responses were monitored in the presence of Bz, a specific blocker of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). CT responses were also recorded in the presence of agonists (resiniferatoxin and elevated temperature) and antagonists (capsazepine and SB-366791) of VR-1 that similarly modulate the Bz-insensitive VR-1 variant salt taste receptor. In the absence of mineral salts, ethanol induced a transient decrease in TRC volume and elicited only transient phasic CT responses. In the presence of mineral salts, ethanol increased the apical cation flux in TRCs without a change in volume, increased transepithelial electrical resistance across the tongue, and elicited CT responses that were similar to salt responses, consisting of both a phasic component and a sustained tonic component. At concentrations <50%, ethanol enhanced responses to KCl and NaCl, while at ethanol concentrations >50%, those CT responses were inhibited. Resiniferatoxin and elevated temperature increased the sensitivity of the CT response to ethanol in salt-containing media, and SB-366791 inhibited the effect of ethanol, resiniferatoxin, and elevated temperature on the CT responses to mineral salts. VR-1 KO mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive CT response to NaCl and no sensitivity to ethanol.

CT responses were monitored during lingual stimulation with ethanol solutions containing NaCl or KCl. CT responses were recorded in the presence of Bz (a specific blocker of the epithelial Na+ channel [ENaC]) or the vanilloid receptor-1 (VR-1) antagonists capsazepine or SB-366791, which also block the Bz-insensitive salt taste receptor, a VR-1 variant. CT responses were recorded at 23°C or 42°C (a temperature at which the VR-1 variant salt taste receptor activity is maximally enhanced). In the absence of permeable cations, ethanol induced a transient decrease in TRC volume, and stimulating the tongue with ethanol solutions without added salt elicited only transient phasic CT responses that were insensitive to elevated temperature or SB-366791. Preshrinking TRCs in vivo with hypertonic mannitol (0.5 M) attenuated the magnitude of the phasic CT response, indicating that in the absence of mineral salts, transient phasic CT responses are related to the ethanol-induced osmotic shrinkage of TRCs. In the presence of mineral salts, ethanol increased the Bz-insensitive apical cation flux in TRCs without a change in cell volume, increased transepithelial electrical resistance across the tongue, and elicited CT responses that were similar to salt responses, consisting of both a transient phasic component and a sustained tonic component. Ethanol increased the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response. This effect was further enhanced by elevating the temperature from 23°C to 42°C, and was blocked by SB-366791. We conclude that in the presence of mineral salts, ethanol modulates the Bz-insensitive VR-1 variant salt taste receptor.",

Mannitol, cellobiose, urea, or DMSO did not induce CT responses. However, the steady-state CT responses to 150 mM NaCl were significantly increased when the stimulus solutions also contained 300 mM mannitol or cellobiose, but not 600 mM urea or DMSO. The enhanced CT responses to NaCl were reversed when the saccharides were removed and were completely blocked by addition of 100 μM amiloride to the stimulus solution. Exposure of TRCs to hyperosmotic solutions of mannitol or cellobiose induced a rapid and sustained decrease in cell volume that was completely reversible, whereas exposure to hypertonic urea or DMSO did not induce sustained reductions in cell volume. These data suggest that the osmolyte-induced increase in the CT response to NaCl involves a sustained decrease in TRC volume and the activation of amiloride-sensitive apical Na+ channels.",

This questioning showed that as the alcohol consumption increased the proportion of subjects who salted their food without tasting or because of salt-free familial meals was greater (P = 0.0018) and, conversely, the proportion of subjects who virtually never added salt to their food decreased (P = 0.0001). There is, therefore, a highly significant correlation between the alcohol consumption level and the type of salt consumption. Whether there is a relationship between the amount of salt consumed and the level of alcohol consumption remains, for the time being, an open question.",

            "abstract": "The vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1) is a ligand-gated, nonselective cation channel important for the sensory processing of painful stimuli. Activation of VR1 leads to increases in intracellular concentrations of calcium and sodium. Prolonged activation of VR1 in mammalian expression systems leads to cell death. The mechanism of VR1-mediated toxicity may have relevance to pathophysiological processes that can occur in neurons. Therefore, we have evaluated the relative contributions of intracellular calcium and sodium changes to VR1-mediated toxicity in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with the human VR1 channel. The data demonstrate that VR1 receptor agonists capsaicin and resiniferatoxin lead to a sustained increase in intracellular calcium and sodium in a concentration-dependent manner, followed by cell death. Pretreatment with VR1 receptor antagonists capsazepine or ruthenium red block both the calcium and sodium responses to agonists, and block agonist-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. However, addition of antagonists several minutes after agonists selectively reverses the agonist-induced increase in intracellular calcium, but does not reverse the elevated intracellular sodium concentration. Nonetheless, antagonists retain protective efficacy against capsaicin toxicity when added several minutes after capsaicin, conditions in which the cells still manifest elevated intracellular sodium, but not elevated intracellular calcium. In addition, a transient VR1-mediated increase in intracellular calcium that returns to baseline within minutes, induced by a rapid drop in pH, from pH 7.5 to pH 6.3, also does not lead to cell death. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the most important intracellular ionic change for mediating VR1-dependent toxicity is a sustained increase of calcium.",

The potentiation of the maximal currents evoked by high concentrations of acetylcholine suggests that ethanol affects the channel gating.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe performed single-channel patch-clamp experiments to elucidate the detailed mechanism of ethanol modulation of the alpha4beta2 receptor that is stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt least two conductance states, 40.5 pS and 21.9 pS, were activated by acetylcholine. Acetylcholine at 30 nM predominantly induced the high conductance state currents (85% of total). Ethanol did not affect the single-channel conductance but selectively modulated the high-conductance state currents. The high-conductance state currents exhibited two open time constants. Both time constants were increased by 100 mM ethanol, from 1.9 msec to 2.8 msec and from 9.0 msec to 15.5 msec, respectively. Ethanol also prolonged the burst duration and the open time within burst and increased the probability of channel opening.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese changes in single-channel parameters indicate that ethanol stabilizes the alpha4beta2 receptor-channel in the opening state, explaining how the maximum acetylcholine-induced whole-cell currents are further potentiated by ethanol.",

            "abstract": "Salt sensing in animals involves the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). If ENaC were involved in human salt sensing, then the lingual surface potential (LSP) would hyperpolarize when exposed to sodium. We developed a chamber to measure the LSP while different solutions superfused the surface of the tongue and a technique to adjust for the junction potentials induced by varying salt concentrations. Changing the superfusion solution from rinse solution (30 mM KCl) to 300 mM NaCl (+30 mM KCl) caused the LSP to hyperpolarize by 10.1 +/- 0.7 mV (n = 13, P < 0.001). With repeated challenge the LSP response was reproducible. Increasing the Na concentration from 100 to 600 mM increased hyperpolarization by 35 +/- 4.8% (n = 9, P < 0.001). To examine whether amiloride affects the LSP, 0.1 mM amiloride was added to 300 mM NaCl; it reduced the hyperpolarization by 18.5 +/- 4.3% (P < 0.005, n = 11). However, the amiloride effect was not uniform: in six volunteers, amiloride inhibited the LSP by as much as 42%, while in five subjects, amiloride inhibited <5% of the LSP. In an amiloride sensitive volunteer, amiloride exerted 50% of its effect at 1 microM. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the LSP can be measured in humans, that Na hyperpolarizes the LSP, that increasing the Na concentration increases LSP hyperpolarization, and that amiloride inhibits the Na evoked LSP in some humans. While ENaC is involved in sensing salt, its role appears to vary among individuals.",

The cellular mechanisms that mediate this phenomenon are not known. This \"anion paradox\" has been resolved by considering the field potential that is generated by restricted electrodiffusion of the anion through paracellular shunts between taste-bud cells. Neural responses to sodium chloride, sodium acetate, and sodium gluconate were studied while the field potential was voltage-clamped. Clamping at electronegative values eliminated the anion effect, whereas clamping at electropositive potentials exaggerated it. Thus, field potentials across the lingual epithelium modulate taste reception, indicating that the functional unit of taste reception includes the taste cell and its paracellular microenvironment.",

Acta physiol. scand. 1965. 64. 398–406.–The response of single gustatory fibres of the chorda tympani in the cat to alcohol has been recorded and compared to the responses to NaCI, sucrose, acetic acid and quinine. Alcohol ewoked a response in all gustatory fibres tested. In regard to their response pattern two principal groups of fibres have been observed. In the first group alcohol produces an initial decrease of the spontaneous activity followed by a delayed and moderate increase. When the tongue is rinsed with water after the alcohol there is a strong burst of impulses. In the second group alcohol produces an immediate response characterized by a moderate increase in impulse frequency. A subsequent application of water does not give rise to any burst of impulses in this group but brings the impulse frequency back to the resting level. An analysis of the response pattern of single gustatory fibres revealed also that the first group of fibres are predominantly sensitive to water, acid and quinine, but is usually not stimulated by NaCl. The second group is generally activated by salt.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE It is becoming apparent that there is a strong link between taste perception and energy homeostasis. Recent evidence implicates gut-related hormones in taste perception, including glucagon-like peptide 1 and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). We used VIP knockout mice to investigate VIP's specific role in taste perception and connection to energy regulation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Body weight, food intake, and plasma levels of multiple energy-regulating hormones were measured and pancreatic morphology was determined. In addition, the immunocytochemical profile of taste cells and gustatory behavior were examined in wild-type and VIP knockout mice. RESULTS VIP knockout mice demonstrate elevated plasma glucose, insulin, and leptin levels, with no islet β-cell number/topography alteration. VIP and its receptors (VPAC1, VPAC2) were identified in type II taste cells of the taste bud, and VIP knockout mice exhibit enhanced taste preference to sweet tastants. VIP knockout mouse taste cells show a significant decrease in leptin receptor expression and elevated expression of glucagon-like peptide 1, which may explain sweet taste preference of VIP knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the tongue can play a direct role in modulating energy intake to correct peripheral glycemic imbalances. In this way, we could view the tongue as a sensory mechanism that is bidirectionally regulated and thus forms a bridge between available foodstuffs and the intricate hormonal balance in the animal itself.",

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE—It has recently been proposed that the peripheral taste organ is one of the targets for leptin. In lean mice, leptin selectively suppresses gustatory neural and behavioral responses to sweet compounds without affecting responses to other taste stimuli, whereas obese diabetic db/db mice with defects in leptin receptor lack this leptin suppression on sweet taste. Here, we further examined potential links between leptin and sweet taste in humans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—A total of 91 nonobese subjects were used to determine recognition thresholds using a standard stair-case methodology for various taste stimuli. Plasma leptin levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at several timepoints during the day under normal and restricted-meal conditions. RESULTS—The recognition thresholds for sweet compounds exhibited a diurnal variation from 0800 to 2200 h that parallels variation for leptin levels, with the lowest thresholds in the morning and the highest thresholds at night. This diurnal variation is sweet-taste selective—it was not observed in thresholds for other taste stimuli (NaCl, citric acid, quinine, and mono-sodium glutamate). The diurnal variation for sweet thresholds in the normal feeding condition (three meals) was independent of meal timing and thereby blood glucose levels. Furthermore, when leptin levels were phase-shifted following imposition of one or two meals per day, the diurnal variation of thresholds for sweet taste shifted in parallel. CONCLUSIONS—This synchronization of diurnal variation in leptin levels and sweet taste recognition thresholds suggests a mechanistic connection between these two variables in humans.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundTaste buds are the sensory organs of taste perception. Three types of taste cells have been described. Type I cells have voltage-gated outward currents, but lack voltage-gated inward currents. These cells have been presumed to play only a support role in the taste bud. Type II cells have voltage-gated Na+ and K+ current, and the receptors and transduction machinery for bitter, sweet, and umami taste stimuli. Type III cells have voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ currents, and make prominent synapses with afferent nerve fibers. Na+ salt transduction in part involves amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). In rodents, these channels are located in taste cells of fungiform papillae on the anterior part of the tongue innervated by the chorda tympani nerve. However, the taste cell type that expresses ENaCs is not known. This study used whole cell recordings of single fungiform taste cells of transgenic mice expressing GFP in Type II taste cells to identify the taste cells responding to amiloride. We also used immunocytochemistry to further define and compare cell types in fungiform and circumvallate taste buds of these mice.ResultsTaste cell types were identified by their response to depolarizing voltage steps and their presence or absence of GFP fluorescence. TRPM5-GFP taste cells expressed large voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents, but lacked voltage-gated Ca2+ currents, as expected from previous studies. Approximately half of the unlabeled cells had similar membrane properties, suggesting they comprise a separate population of Type II cells. The other half expressed voltage-gated outward currents only, typical of Type I cells. A single taste cell had voltage-gated Ca2+ current characteristic of Type III cells. Responses to amiloride occurred only in cells that lacked voltage-gated inward currents. Immunocytochemistry showed that fungiform taste buds have significantly fewer Type II cells expressing PLC signalling components, and significantly fewer Type III cells than circumvallate taste buds.ConclusionThe principal finding is that amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels appear to be expressed in cells that lack voltage-gated inward currents, likely the Type I taste cells. These cells were previously assumed to provide only a support function in the taste bud.",

            "abstract": "Mammals use common mechanisms to detect, transduce and process taste stimulus information. For example, they share families of receptors that respond to amino acids, and sweet- and bitter-tasting stimuli. Nonetheless, it also clear that different species exhibit unique taste sensitivities that may reflect specific genetic variations. In humans, sensitivities to the chemically similar, bitter-tasting compounds 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) are heritable and strongly correlated, suggesting a common genetic basis. However, it is unknown whether PROP and PTC taste sensitivities are similarly correlated in mice. Here we report that PROP and PTC taste sensitivities vary independently between two inbred strains of mice. In brief-access taste tests C3HeB/FeJ (C3) and SWR/J (SW) mice possess similar taste sensitivity to PTC, while SW mice are significantly more sensitive to PROP than are C3 mice. In two-bottle preference tests, however, SW mice display greater aversion to both compounds. This discrepancy may be explained by the observation that SW mice consumed taste solutions at a greater rate during the intake test than did C3 mice. Therefore, PTC avoidance is correlated with the amount of PTC consumed in the intake tests rather than the concentration of PTC tested. These findings suggest that post-ingestive factors play a significant role in PTC avoidance during intake tests and highlight an important advantage of brief-access tests over intake tests in resolving the gustatory and post-ingestive contributions to taste-related behaviors. Most strikingly, these results demonstrate that in mice, unlike in humans, PTC and PROP taste sensitivities vary independently, thereby suggesting a subtle functional diversity of bitter-taste mechanisms across mammalian species.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundNumerous electrophysiological, ultrastructural, and immunocytochemical studies on rodent taste buds have been carried out on rat taste buds. In recent years, however, the mouse has become the species of choice for molecular and other studies on sensory transduction in taste buds. Do rat and mouse taste buds have the same cell types, sensory transduction markers and synaptic proteins? In the present study we have used antisera directed against PLCβ2, α-gustducin, serotonin (5-HT), PGP 9.5 and synaptobrevin-2 to determine the percentages of taste cells expressing these markers in taste buds in both rodent species. We also determined the numbers of taste cells in the taste buds as well as taste bud volume.ResultsThere are significant differences (p < 0.05) between mouse and rat taste buds in the percentages of taste cells displaying immunoreactivity for all five markers. Rat taste buds display significantly more immunoreactivity than mice for PLCβ2 (31.8% vs 19.6%), α-gustducin (18% vs 14.6%), and synaptobrevin-2 (31.2% vs 26.3%). Mice, however, have more cells that display immunoreactivity to 5-HT (15.9% vs 13.7%) and PGP 9.5 (14.3% vs 9.4%). Mouse taste buds contain an average of 85.8 taste cells vs 68.4 taste cells in rat taste buds. The average volume of a mouse taste bud (42,000 μm3) is smaller than a rat taste bud (64,200 μm3). The numerical density of taste cells in mouse circumvallate taste buds (2.1 cells/1000 μm3) is significantly higher than that in the rat (1.2 cells/1000 μm3).ConclusionThese results suggest that rats and mice differ significantly in the percentages of taste cells expressing signaling molecules. We speculate that these observed dissimilarities may reflect differences in their gustatory processing.",

We combined functional calcium imaging with single-cell molecular profiling to demonstrate the existence of two distinct cell types in mouse taste buds. Calcium imaging revealed that isolated taste cells responded with a transient elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ to either tastants or depolarization with KCl, but never both. Using single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, we show that individual taste cells express either phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2) (an essential taste transduction effector) or synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) (a key component of calcium-triggered transmitter exocytosis). The two functional classes revealed by calcium imaging mapped onto the two gene expression classes determined by single-cell RT-PCR. Specifically, cells responding to tastants expressed PLCβ2, whereas cells responding to KCl depolarization expressed SNAP25. We demonstrate this by two methods: first, through sequential calcium imaging and single-cell RT-PCR; second, by performing calcium imaging on taste buds in slices from transgenic mice in which PLCβ2-expressing taste cells are labeled with green fluorescent protein. To evaluate the significance of the SNAP25-expressing cells, we used RNA amplification from single cells, followed by RT-PCR. We show that SNAP25-positive cells also express typical presynaptic proteins, including a voltage-gated calcium channel (α1A), neural cell adhesion molecule, synapsin-II, and the neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes glutamic acid decarboxylase and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. No synaptic markers were detected in PLCβ2 cells by either amplified RNA profiling or by immunocytochemistry. These data demonstrate the existence of at least two molecularly distinct functional classes of taste cells: receptor cells and synapse-forming cells.",

Although there has been considerable progress in elucidating the molecular signal transduction pathways and physiological responses of neurons and other cells to individual growth factors, little is known about if and how signals from different growth factors are integrated within a neuron. In this study, we determined the interactive effects of nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and epidermal growth factor on the activation status of downstream kinase cascades and transcription factors, cell survival, and neurotransmitter production in neural cells that express receptors for all three growth factors. We document considerable differences in the quality and quantity of intracellular signaling and eventual phenotypic responses that are dependent on whether cells are exposed to a single or multiple growth factors. Dual stimulations that generated the greatest antagonistic or synergistic actions, compared with a theoretically neutral summation of their two activities, yielded the largest eventual change of neuronal phenotype indicated by the ability of the cell to produce norepinephrine or resist oxidative stress. Combined activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 and epidermal growth factor receptors was particularly notable for antagonistic interactions at some levels of signal transduction and norepinephrine production, but potentiation at other levels of signaling and cytoprotection. Our findings suggest that in true physiological settings where multiple growth factors are present, activation of one receptor type may result in molecular and phenotypic responses that are different from that observed in typical experimental paradigms in which cells are exposed to only a single growth factor at a time.",

The model of chemosensory processing in the taste bud presented here can now be explored in great detail. The synaptic organization of the taste bud indicates a potential for intriguing peripheral integrative mechanisms, including cross-talk between taste cells, summation of chemoreceptor responses by interneurons (basal cells) in the taste bud, and centrifugal control of taste buds via efferent input from the CNS. Figure 2 summarizes these findings. The existence of voltage-gated ionic channels on taste cells and their unequal distribution in apical and basolateral membrane suggests mechanisms for chemosensory transduction: A primary event in the transduction process for many taste stimuli is likely to be the closure of apical potassium channels, thus leading to a depolarizing receptor potential. The closure of these apical potassium channels is probably mediated via cyclic nucleotides or intracellular Ca2+.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundTaste receptor cells are responsible for transducing chemical stimuli into electrical signals that lead to the sense of taste. An important second messenger in taste transduction is IP3, which is involved in both bitter and sweet transduction pathways. Several components of the bitter transduction pathway have been identified, including the T2R/TRB taste receptors, phospholipase C β2, and the G protein subunits α-gustducin, β3, and γ13. However, the identity of the IP3 receptor subtype in this pathway is not known. In the present study we used immunocytochemistry on rodent taste tissue to identify the IP3 receptors expressed in taste cells and to examine taste bud expression patterns for IP3R3.ResultsAntibodies against Type I, II, and III IP3 receptors were tested on sections of rat and mouse circumvallate papillae. Robust cytoplasmic labeling for the Type III IP3 receptor (IP3R3) was found in a large subset of taste cells in both species. In contrast, little or no immunoreactivity was seen with antibodies against the Type I or Type II IP3 receptors. To investigate the potential role of IP3R3 in bitter taste transduction, we used double-label immunocytochemistry to determine whether IP3R3 is expressed in the same subset of cells expressing other bitter signaling components. IP3R3 immunoreactive taste cells were also immunoreactive for PLCβ2 and γ13. Alpha-gustducin immunoreactivity was present in a subset of IP3R3, PLCβ2, and γ13 positive cells.ConclusionsIP3R3 is the dominant form of the IP3 receptor expressed in taste cells and our data suggest it plays an important role in bitter taste transduction.",

We report here that prolonged exposure to denatonium induces sustained increases in [Ca2+]i that are dependent on Ca2+ influx. Similar results were obtained from taste cells of the mudpuppy, Necturus maculosus, as well as green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged gustducin-expressing taste cells of transgenic mice. In a subset of mudpuppy taste cells, prolonged exposure to denatonium induced oscillatory Ca2+ responses. Depletion of Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin also induced Ca2+ influx, suggesting that Ca2+ store-operated channels (SOCs) are present in both mudpuppy taste cells and gustducin-expressing taste cells of mouse. Further, treatment with thapsigargin prevented subsequent responses to denatonium, suggesting that the SOCs were the source of the Ca2+ influx. These data suggest that SOCs may contribute to bitter taste transduction and to regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in taste cells.",

            "abstract": "The present study defines the cellular composition of chemosensory corpuscles (taste buds) present in the mucosa overlying the arytenoid cartilages of the larynx in serial sections studied by electron microscopy. Three cell types can be defined in such chemosensory corpuscles. Basal cells are relatively undifferentiated in terms of cytologic characteristics and have been identified presumptively as the stem cells for differentiation of the other two cell types. Sustentacular or supporting cells are characterized by the presence of apical electron-opaque granules that apparently are extruded into the lumen of the pore, and are, thus, the source of the electron-opaque extracellular material present between the microvilli protruding from the apex of the cells into the chemosensory corpuscle pore. The chemosensory cells are characterized by the presence of synaptic specializations with appended nerve fibers at the base of the cell, the presence of specific cytoplasmic secretory granules, as well as numerous clusters of typical synaptic vesicles, and apical microvilli that extend into the pore of the corpuscle. Other cell profiles encountered in chemosensory corpuscles are cells in various stages of degeneration or transition, to one of the other cell types, from undifferentiated basal cells. Two types of synaptic specializations have been identified as being associated with chemosensory cells. The first is characterized by an increased electron-opacity of the respective plasma membranes of nerve fiber and chemosensory cell. In this situation numerous synaptic vesicles usually are present in the cytoplasm of the chemosensory cell subjacent to the membrane densities. A second type of synaptic association is characterized by the presence of subsurface cisterns of agranular endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm of the chemosensory cell, and numerous synaptic vesicles often are present in the axoplasm of the subjacent neurite, suggesting a reciprocal synapse. These findings are interpreted to indicate that only one cell type is specialized for transducing chemical signals into neural activity and that this cell is modulated by activity of the nervous system.",

            "abstract": "Cells of mammalian taste buds have been classified into morphological types based on ultrastructural criteria, but investigators have disagreed as to whether these are distinct cell types or the extremes of a continuum. To address this issue, we examined taste buds from rat vallate papillae that had been sectioned transversely, rather than longitudinally, to their longest axis. In these transverse sections, dark (Type I) and light (Type II) cells were easily distinguished by their relative electron density, shape and topological relationships. Cells with electron-lucent cytoplasm (light cells) were circular or oval in outline, while those with electron-dense cytoplasm (dark cells) had an irregular outline with sheetlike cytoplasmic projections that separated adjacent light cells. A hierarchical cluster analysis of 314 cells across five morphological parameters (cell shape and area, and nuclear ellipticity, electron density and invagination) revealed two distinct groups of cells, which largely corresponded to the dark and light cells identified visually. These cells were not continuously distributed within a principal components factor solution. Differences in the means for dark and light cells were highly significant for each morphological parameter, but within either cell type, changes in one parameter correlated little with changes in any other. These analyses all failed to reveal cells with a consistent set of intermediate characteristics, suggesting that dark and light cells of rat vallate taste buds are distinct cell types rather than extremes of a continuum. Sections of taste buds were stained with antibodies to several carbohydrates, then observed by indirect immunofluorescence. Optical sections taken with a confocal laser-scanning microscope showed that the Lewis antigen was present only on spindle-shaped cells with circular or oval outlines and lacking transverse projections; these characteristic shapes matched those of light cells seen by electron microscopy. The H blood group antigen and the 2B8 epitope appeared at most cell-cell interfaces in the bud and are present on dark cells and possibly on some light cells. These findings relate molecular markers to morphological phenotypes and should facilitate future studies of taste cell turnover, development and regeneration.",

Although the machinery for protein synthesis and several mRNAs are present in dendrites and close to synapses in central neurons, so far the mRNAs for neurotransmitter receptors have not been found unequivocally in dendrites. The glycine receptor (GlyR), a ligand-gated channel mediating a chloride-dependent inhibition, is composed of transmembrane α and β subunits. GlyRs are only present at glycinergic postsynaptic differentiation, where they are stabilized by the associated protein gephyrin. With light nonradioactive in situ hybridization (ISH), we observe that GlyR α subunit mRNAs are present in both somata and dendrites of most neurons of the ventral horn of rat spinal cord, whereas the β subunit and gephyrin mRNAs are predominantly in somata. Interestingly, within dendrites GlyR α subunit mRNAs form aggregates that are mostly localized peripherally to the dendritic axial core. Electron microscopic ISH shows that GlyR α subunit mRNAs are associated with postsynaptic differentiations. At these sites, the GlyR α subunit mRNAs are detected in close association with subsynaptic cisternae. This targeting of α subunit mRNAs to postsynaptic domains could provide a means of dynamically modulating synaptic efficacy by changing the composition and the density of receptors at glycinergic synapses.",

It is most commonly known as a flavouring enhancer in food processing, which provides umami taste that intensifies the meaty, savory flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups. The amino acid glutamic acid it is naturally presents in food. Globally, commercial MSG’s consumption is increasing, markable high in Asia. Likewise, its production has known improvements regarding both method and technical equipment. Although MSG’s safety was evaluated by international organizations (EFSA, FDA) as safe and the limits were set up, there are studies concern about its side effects such as obesity, asthma, migraine headache, etc. The European Union classifies it as a food additive permitted in certain foods and subject to quantitative limits. The increase in commercially MSG use has raised the concern of both scientists and consumers about its safety. Therefore, due to a need of full comprehension about MSG, it is necessary to give more attention in studying it. Advantage in the development of analysis methods and technical equipments should be exploited to obtain higher accuracy result. This review provides a brief and general information about MSG with updates in its research.",

Within a year, he had succeeded in isolating, purifying, and identifying the principal component of umami and quickly obtained a production patent. In 1909 Saburosuke Suzuki, an entrepreneur, and Ikeda began the industrial production of monosodium l-glutamate (MSG). The first industrial production process was an extraction method in which vegetable proteins were treated with hydrochloric acid to disrupt peptide bonds. l-Glutamic acid hydrochloride was then isolated from this material and purified as MSG. Initial production of MSG was limited because of the technical drawbacks of this method. Better methods did not emerge until the 1950s. One of these was direct chemical synthesis, which was used from 1962 to 1973. In this procedure, acrylonitrile was the starting material, and optical resolution of dl-glutamic acid was achieved by preferential crystallization. In 1956 a direct fermentation method to produce glutamate was introduced. The advantages of the fermentation method (eg, reduction of production costs and environmental load) were large enough to cause all glutamate manufacturers to shift to fermentation. Today, total world production of MSG by fermentation is estimated to be 2 million tons/y (2 billion kg/y). However, future production growth will likely require further innovation.",

Objectives: The effect of monosodium glutamate (MSG) used as food additive on the ovaries of adult Wistar rat was investigated. Methods: Adult female Wistar rats (n=24) weighing between 182 to 186grams were randomly assigned into three groups A, B and C of (n=8) in each group. The treatment groups (A and B) were given 0.04mg/kg body weight and 0.08mg/kg of monosodium glutamate thoroughly mixed with the grower's marsh, respectively on a daily basis. The control group (C); received equal amount of feeds (Growers’ mash) without monosodium glutamate added for fourteen days. The grower's mash was obtained from Edo Feeds and Flour Mill Ltd, Ewu, Edo State and the rats were given water liberally. The rats were sacrificed on day fifteen of the experiment. The ovaries were carefully dissected out and quickly fixed in 10% formal saline for routine histological procedures. Results: The histological findings in the treated groups showed evidence of cellular hypertrophy, degenerative and atrophic changes with more severe changes in the group that received 0.08mg/kg of MSG. Conclusion: These findings indicate that MSG may have some deleterious effects on the oocytes of the ovaries of adult Wistar rats at higher doses and by extension may contribute to the causes of female infertility. It is recommended that further studies aimed at corroborating these findings be carried out.",

This study investigated cellular and subcellular level changes in the small intestine of obese mice. In this study, a mouse model of obesity was established by early postnatal administration of monosodium glutamate. Changes in body weight were monitored, and pathological changes in the small intestine were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining and light and electron microscopy. Consequently, obese mice were significantly heavier compared with controls from 9 weeks of age. Villi in the small intestine of obese mice were elongated and thinned. There was reduced hematoxylin staining in the epithelium of the small intestine of obese mice. Electron microscopy revealed a significant decrease in and shortening of rough endoplasmic reticulum in epithelial cells of the small intestine of obese mice compared with normal mice. The decrease in rough endoplasmic reticulum in the small intestine epithelial cells of obese mice indicates that obesity starting in childhood influences various functions of the small intestine, such as protein synthesis, and could impair both the defense mechanism against invasion of pathogenic microbes and nutritional absorption.",

It is mainly used as a food additive and flavor enhancer in the form of sodium salt. Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum) is one of the major organisms widely used for glutamic acid production. Methods The study was dealing with immobilization of C. glutamicum and mixed culture of C. glutamicum and Pseudomonas reptilivora (P. reptilivora) for L-glutamic acid production using submerged fermentation. 2, 3 and 5% sodium alginate concentrations were used for production and reusability of immobilized cells for 5 more trials. Results The results revealed that 2% sodium alginate concentration produced the highest yield (13.026±0.247 g/l by C. glutamicum and 16.026±0.475 g/l by mixed immobilized culture). Moreover, reusability of immobilized cells was evaluated in 2% concentration with 5 more trials. However, when the number of cycles increased, the production of L-glutamic acid decreased. Conclusion Production of glutamic acid using optimized medium minimizes the time needed for designing the medium composition. It also minimizes external contamination. Glutamic acid production gradually decreased due to multiple uses of beads and consequently it reduces the shelf life.",

            "abstract": "Dietary free l-glutamate has been known for a century to improve taste and palatability. Recent evidence suggests that this effect is mediated through specific l-glutamate receptors located on the taste buds. However, l-glutamate receptors are also present elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach. Here, l-glutamate exerts physiologic actions beneficial to gut function by stimulating l-glutamate receptors linked to the gastric vagus nerve. In addition, dietary l-glutamate also appears to be an important energy substrate for gut tissue. Can such l-glutamate effects on taste and gut function be clinically useful? Elderly people often develop health problems related to their nutritional status that can be linked to insufficient energy and nutrient intake. A number of studies have examined the potential usefulness of l-glutamate, added to food in the form of monosodium glutamate (MSG), in promoting better nutrition in the elderly and in patients with poor nutrition. Some positive effects have been observed. This article reviews the physiologic roles of dietary l-glutamate in relation to alimentation and examines the evidence linking the utility of MSG supplementation to the improvement of nutrition in elderly and hospitalized patients.",

        "abstract": "Behaviour of umami compounds that are associated with non-volatile compounds on slow cooking regimes remains less explored. This study aims to assess the ability of the electronic tongue system on the umami taste from sous-vide beef semitendinosus. The identification was based on the taste-enhancing synergism between umami compounds 5’-nucleotides (IMP, GMP, AMP, inosine, and hypoxanthine) and free amino acids (glutamic and aspartic acid) using the estimation of equivalent umami concentration (EUC) and electronic tongue system. Sous-vide cooked at 60 and 70 °C for 6 and 12 h and cooked using the conventional method at 70 °C for 30 min (as control) were compared. The temperature had a significant effect on 5’-nucleotides, but aspartic and glutamic acid were not influenced by any treatments applied. Sous-vide cooked at 60 °C tended to have higher inosine and hypoxanthine. Meanwhile, desirable 5’-nucleotides IMP, AMP, and GMP were more intensified at the temperature of 70 °C. The principal component analysis predicted a good correlation between EUC and the electronic tongue, with sous-vide at 70 °C for 12 h presenting the most umami. Therefore, the electronic tongue system is a useful tool in food processing, particularly in determining complex sensory properties such as umami, which cannot be evaluated objectively.",

            "abstract": "This study examined the concentrations of umami compounds in pork loins cooked at 3 different temperatures and 3 different lengths of cooking times. The pork loins were cooked with the sous vide technique. The free amino acids (FAAs), glutamic acid and aspartic acid; the 5'-nucleotides, inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP) and adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP); and corresponding nucleoside inosine of the cooked meat and its released juice were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Under the experimental conditions used, the cooking temperature played a more important role than the cooking time in the concentration of the analyzed compounds. The amino acid concentrations in the meat did not remain constant under these experimental conditions. The most notable effect observed was that of the cooking temperature and the higher amino acid concentrations in the released juice of meat cooked at 80 °C compared with 60 and 70 °C. This is most likely due to the heat induced hydrolysis of proteins and peptides releasing water soluble FAAs from the meat into the cooking juice. In this experiment, the cooking time and temperature had no influence on the IMP concentrations observed. However, the AMP concentrations increased with the increasing temperature and time. This suggests that the choice of time and temperature in sous vide cooking affects the nucleotide concentration of pork meat. The Sous vide technique proved to be a good technique to preserve the cooking juice and the results presented here show that cooking juice is rich in umami compounds, which can be used to provide a savory or brothy taste.",

            "title": "Molecular Gastronomy: A New Emerging Scientific Discipline",
            "abstract": "The science of domestic and restaurant cooking has recently moved from the playground of a few interested amateurs into the realm of serious scientific endeavor. A number of restaurants around the world have started to adopt a more scientific approach in their kitchens,1–3 and perhaps partly as a result, several of these have become acclaimed as being among the best in the world.4,5 \n \nToday, many food writers and chefs, as well as most gourmets, agree that chemistry lies at the heart of the very finest food available in some of the world’s finest restaurants. At least in the world of gourmet food, chemistry has managed to replace its often tarnished image with a growing respect as the application of basic chemistry in the kitchen has provided the starting point for a whole new cuisine. The application of chemistry and other sciences to restaurant and domestic cooking is thus making a positive impact in a very public arena which inevitably gives credence to the subject as a whole. \n \nAs yet, however, this activity has been largely in the form of small collaborations between scientists and chefs. To date, little “new science” has emerged, but many novel applications of existing science have been made, assisting chefs to produce new dishes and extend the range of techniques available in their kitchens. Little of this work has appeared in the scientific literature,2,3,6–9 but the work has received an enormous amount of media attention. A quick Google search will reveal thousands of news articles over the past few years; a very few recent examples can be found in China,(10) the United States,11,12 and Australia.(13) \n \nIn this review we bring together the many strands of chemistry that have been and are increasingly being used in the kitchen to provide a sound basis for further developments in the area. We also attempt throughout to show using relevant illustrative examples how knowledge and understanding of chemistry can be applied to good effect in the domestic and restaurant kitchen. \n \nOur basic premise is that the application of chemical and physical techniques in some restaurant kitchens to produce novel textures and flavor combinations has not only revolutionized the restaurant experience but also led to new enjoyment and appreciation of food. Examples include El Bulli (in Spain) and the Fat Duck (in the United Kingdom), two restaurants that since adopting a scientific approach to cooking have become widely regarded as among the finest in the world. All this begs the fundamental question: why should these novel textures and flavors provide so much real pleasure for the diners? \n \nSuch questions are at the heart of the new science of Molecular Gastronomy. The term Molecular Gastronomy has gained a lot of publicity over the past few years, largely because some chefs have started to label their cooking style as Molecular Gastronomy (MG) and claimed to be bringing the use of scientific principles into the kitchen. However, we should note that three of the first chefs whose food was “labeled” as MG have recently written a new manifesto protesting against this label.(14) They rightly contend that what is important is the finest food prepared using the best available ingredients and using the most appropriate methods (which naturally includes the use of “new” ingredients, for example, gelling agents such as gellan or carageenan, and processes, such as vacuum distillation, etc.). \n \nWe take a broad view of Molecular Gastronomy and argue it should be considered as the scientific study of why some food tastes terrible, some is mediocre, some good, and occasionally some absolutely delicious. We want to understand what it is that makes one dish delicious and another not, whether it be the choice of ingredients and how they were grown, the manner in which the food was cooked and presented, or the environment in which it was served. All will play their own roles, and there are valid scientific enquiries to be made to elucidate the extent to which they each affect the final result, but chemistry lies at the heart of all these diverse disciplines. \n \nThe judgment of the quality of a dish is a highly personal matter as is the extent to which a particular meal is enjoyed or not. Nevertheless, we hypothesize that there are a number of conditions that must be met before food becomes truly enjoyable. These include many aspects of the flavor. Clearly, the food should have flavor; but what conditions are truly important? Does it matter, for example, how much flavor a dish has; is the concentration of the flavor molecules important? How important is the order in which the flavor molecules are released? How does the texture affect the flavor? The long-term aims of the science of MG are not only to provide chefs with tools to assist them in producing the finest dishes but also to elucidate the minimum set of conditions that are required for a dish to be described by a representative group of individuals as enjoyable or delicious, to find ways in which these conditions can be met (through the production of raw materials, in the cooking process, and in the way in which the food is presented), and hence to be able to predict reasonably well whether a particular dish or meal would be delicious. It may even become possible to give some quantitative measure of just how delicious a particular dish will be to a particular individual. \n \nClearly, this is an immense task involving many different aspects of the chemical sciences: from the way in which food is produced through the harvesting, packaging, and transport to market via the processing and cooking to the presentation on the plate and how the body and brain react to the various stimuli presented. \n \nMG is distinct from traditional Food Science as it is concerned principally with the science behind any conceivable food preparation technique that may be used in a restaurant environment or even in domestic cooking from readily available ingredients to produce the best possible result. Conversely, Food Science is concerned, in large measure, with food production on an industrial scale and nutrition and food safety. \n \nA further distinction is that although Molecular Gastronomy includes the science behind gastronomic food, to understand gastronomy it is sometimes also necessary to appreciate its wider background. Thus, investigations of food history and culture may be subjects for investigation within the overall umbrella of Molecular Gastronomy. \n \nFurther, gastronomy is characterized by the fact that strong, even passionate feelings can be involved. Leading chefs express their own emotions and visions through the dishes they produce. Some chefs stick closely to tradition, while others can be highly innovative and even provocative. In this sense gastronomy can be considered as an art form similar to painting and music. \n \nIn this review we begin with a short description of our senses of taste and aroma and how we use these and other senses to provide the sensation of flavor. We will show that flavor is not simply the sum of the individual stimuli from the receptors in the tongue and nose but far more complex. In fact, the best we can say is that flavor is constructed in the mind using cues taken from all the senses including, but not limited to, the chemical senses of taste and smell. It is necessary to bear this background in mind throughout the whole review so we do not forget that even if we fully understand the complete chemical composition, physical state, and morphological complexity of a dish, this alone will not tell us whether it will provide an enjoyable eating experience. \n \nIn subsequent sections we will take a walk through the preparation of a meal, starting with the raw ingredients to see how the chemical make up of even the apparently simplest ingredients such as carrots or tomatoes is greatly affected by all the different agricultural processes they may be subjected to before arriving in the kitchen. \n \nOnce we have ingredients in the kitchen and start to cut, mix, and cook them, a vast range of chemical reactions come into play, destroying some and creating new flavor compounds. We devote a considerable portion of the review to the summary of some of these reactions. However, we must note that complete textbooks have failed to capture the complexity of many of these, so all we can do here is to provide a general overview of some important aspects that commonly affect flavor in domestic and restaurant kitchens. \n \nIn nearly all cooking, the texture of the food is as important as its flavor: the flavor of roast chicken is pretty constant, but the texture varies from the wonderfully tender meat that melts in the mouth to the awful rubber chicken of so many conference dinners. Understanding and controlling texture not only of meats but also of sauces, souffles, breads, cakes, and pastries, etc., will take us on a tour through a range of chemical and physical disciplines as we look, for example, at the spinning of glassy sugars to produce candy-floss. \n \nFinally, after a discussion of those factors in our food that seem to contribute to making it delicious, we enter the world of brain chemistry, and much of that is speculative. We will end up with a list of areas of potential new research offering all chemists the opportunity to join us in the exciting new adventures of Molecular Gastronomy and the possibility of collaborating with chefs to create new and better food in their own local neighborhoods.

            "abstract": "The first electrophysiological studies on umami taste were conducted with rats and cats. Unlike humans, these animals did not show a large synergism between monosodium glutamate (MSG) and disodium guanylate (GMP) or disodium inosinate (IMP). The taste nerve responses of these animals to umami substances were not differentiated from the salt responses. The canine taste system was sensitive to umami substances and showed a large synergism between MSG and GMP or IMP. The umami substances showed no enhancing effects on other basic tastes. Amiloride, an inhibitor for the response to NaCl, did not inhibit the large response induced by the synergism between MSG and the nucleotides, indicating that the response to the umami substances is independent of the response to salt. Single-fiber analysis on the responses of mouse glossopharyngeal nerve and monkey primary taste cortex neurons also showed that the responses to umami substances are independent of other basic tastes. On the basis of these results, it was proposed that the umami taste is a fifth basic taste, and that there is a unique receptor for umami substances. Hence, we compared the taste of agonists for brain glutamate receptors. In humans, the order of intensity of umami taste induced by a mixture of 0.5 mmol/L GMP and 1.5 mmol/L of various agonists was glutamate > ibotenate > L(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) = (+/-)1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD). Kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and (RS)-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), which are agonists for ionotropic receptors, had no umami taste. It was concluded that the umami receptor is not identical to any known glutamate receptors; there seems, therefore, to be a unique receptor for umami.",

Since that time, umami seasoning has been used to make foods palatable all over the world. Chemical analysis proved that Glu had been used for savory seasonings around the world, though its taste had been hidden behind the flavors of fat or herbs. Recently, research has shown that Glu affects the chemical senses not only in the oral cavity but also in the gastrointestinal tract, and it modulates the ingestion, digestion and metabolism of proteins. Umami taste, one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, salty, sour and bitter tastes, derived from Japanese cuisine, might be applicable for the nutritional care of elderly people, who are at risk for protein malnutrition even in developed countries.",

The model of chemosensory processing in the taste bud presented here can now be explored in great detail. The synaptic organization of the taste bud indicates a potential for intriguing peripheral integrative mechanisms, including cross-talk between taste cells, summation of chemoreceptor responses by interneurons (basal cells) in the taste bud, and centrifugal control of taste buds via efferent input from the CNS. Figure 2 summarizes these findings. The existence of voltage-gated ionic channels on taste cells and their unequal distribution in apical and basolateral membrane suggests mechanisms for chemosensory transduction: A primary event in the transduction process for many taste stimuli is likely to be the closure of apical potassium channels, thus leading to a depolarizing receptor potential. The closure of these apical potassium channels is probably mediated via cyclic nucleotides or intracellular Ca2+.",

When an action potential arrives in the nerve terminal , the membrane depolarizes and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open . The resulting Ca2+ influx triggers exocytosis of synaptic vesicles , resulting in the release of neurotransmitter. The synaptic vesicle membrane is rapidly retrieved by endocytosis and reutilized for the formation of synaptic vesicles. These vesicles are reloaded with transmitter for another round of exocytosis . This cycle is repeated many times and can be studied in nerve terminals that have no connection with the neuronal cell body . Thus , the presynaptic compartment consists of an autonomous unit that contains all components required for repetitive exocytosis and membrane recycling . In contrast, release of neuropeptides involves large dense core vesicles that follow a different route; they will not be considered in this discussion (for review, see Thureson-Klein & Klein 1990) .

We show here that SuP is identical to SNAP-25, a highly conserved synaptic protein of known primary structure, by immunoprecipitation with anti-SNAP-25 antiserum of SuP labeled with 35S-methionine and transported by retinal ganglion cells of rat and cat. In addition, we show that SNAP-25/SuP is the most prominent species among retinal polypeptides that incorporate 3H- palmitate in vivo, that it is fatty acylated through a hydroxylamine- labile, thioester bond, and that palmitoylated SNAP-25/SuP is axonally transported. Thus, SNAP-25/SuP is a rapidly transported constituent of the presynaptic apparatus and a major neuronal substrate for long-chain fatty acylation.",

            "abstract": "Cells of mammalian taste buds have been classified into morphological types based on ultrastructural criteria, but investigators have disagreed as to whether these are distinct cell types or the extremes of a continuum. To address this issue, we examined taste buds from rat vallate papillae that had been sectioned transversely, rather than longitudinally, to their longest axis. In these transverse sections, dark (Type I) and light (Type II) cells were easily distinguished by their relative electron density, shape and topological relationships. Cells with electron-lucent cytoplasm (light cells) were circular or oval in outline, while those with electron-dense cytoplasm (dark cells) had an irregular outline with sheetlike cytoplasmic projections that separated adjacent light cells. A hierarchical cluster analysis of 314 cells across five morphological parameters (cell shape and area, and nuclear ellipticity, electron density and invagination) revealed two distinct groups of cells, which largely corresponded to the dark and light cells identified visually. These cells were not continuously distributed within a principal components factor solution. Differences in the means for dark and light cells were highly significant for each morphological parameter, but within either cell type, changes in one parameter correlated little with changes in any other. These analyses all failed to reveal cells with a consistent set of intermediate characteristics, suggesting that dark and light cells of rat vallate taste buds are distinct cell types rather than extremes of a continuum. Sections of taste buds were stained with antibodies to several carbohydrates, then observed by indirect immunofluorescence. Optical sections taken with a confocal laser-scanning microscope showed that the Lewis antigen was present only on spindle-shaped cells with circular or oval outlines and lacking transverse projections; these characteristic shapes matched those of light cells seen by electron microscopy. The H blood group antigen and the 2B8 epitope appeared at most cell-cell interfaces in the bud and are present on dark cells and possibly on some light cells. These findings relate molecular markers to morphological phenotypes and should facilitate future studies of taste cell turnover, development and regeneration.",

The labeled-line (sparse coding) view differs from the across-neuron pattern (ensemble) counterpoint in proposing that activity in a given class of neurons is necessary and sufficient to generate a specific taste perception. This article critically reviews molecular, electro-physiological, and behavioral findings that bear on the issue. In the peripheral gustatory system, the authors conclude that most qualities appear to be signaled by labeled lines; however, elements of both types of coding characterize signaling of sodium salts. Given the heterogeneity of neuronal tuning functions in the brain, the central coding mechanism is less clear. Both sparse coding and neuronal ensemble models remain viable possibilities. Furthermore, temporal patterns of discharge could contribute additional information. Ultimately, until specific classes of neurons can be selectively manipulated and perceptual consequences assessed, it will be difficult to go beyond mere correlation and conclusively discern the validity of these coding models.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in peripheral taste physiology now suggest that the classic linear view of information processing within the taste bud is inadequate and that paracrine processing, although undemonstrated, may be an essential feature of peripheral gustatory transduction. Taste receptor cells (TRCs) express multiple neurotransmitters of unknown function that could potentially participate in a paracrine role. Serotonin is expressed in a subset of TRCs with afferent synapses; additionally, TRCs respond physiologically to serotonin. This study explored the expression and cellular localization of serotonin receptor subtypes in TRCs as a possible route of paracrine communication. RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from rat posterior taste buds with 14 prime sets representing 5-HT(1) through 5-HT(7) receptor subtype families. Data suggest that 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(3) receptors are expressed in taste buds. Immunocytochemistry with a 5-HT(1A)-specific antibody demonstrated that subsets of TRCs were immunopositive for 5-HT(1A). With the use of double-labeling, serotonin- and 5-HT(1A)-immunopositive cells were observed exclusively in nonoverlapping populations. On the other hand, 5-HT(3)-immunopositive taste receptor cells were not observed. This observation, combined with other data, suggests 5-HT(3) is expressed in postsynaptic neural elements within the bud. We hypothesize that 5-HT release from TRCs activates postsynaptic 5-HT(3) receptors on afferent nerve fibers and, via a paracrine route, inhibits neighboring TRCs via 5-HT(1A) receptors. The ole of the 5-HT(1A)-expressing TRC within the taste bud remains to be explored.",

Human volunteers provided psychophysical estimates of pain intensity, which were compared with discharge patterns of rat cutaneous nociceptors tested with identical stimulus protocols.

Stimulus intensities of 25, 50, and 100 g were applied with a probe of contact area of 0.1 mm(2) for 2 min. Pain perception significantly increased during stimulation (temporal summation) for the 50- and 100-g stimulus intensities. Sequential conduction block of the myelinated fibers supplying the stimulated skin was used to investigate the role of A-fiber mechanoreceptors and nociceptors in this temporal summation. Conduction block of the Abeta fibers resulted in an increase in mechanically evoked pain estimates and an increase in temporal summation, consistent with loss of Abeta-mediated inhibition. When only conduction in the unmyelinated fibers remained, pain estimates were reduced to the preblock levels, but temporal summation was still present. Electrophysiological recordings were made from filaments of the sciatic nerve supplying receptors in the plantar skin of barbiturate-anesthetized rats. Forty units fulfilled the identification criteria for nociceptors: 20 A-fiber and 20 C-fiber nociceptors. Each unit was characterized by recording its responses to graded mechanical and heat stimuli. Nociceptors were also tested with stimuli identical to those applied to the human subjects. The responses of all units to sustained mechanical stimuli were adaptive-that is, they exhibited a gradual decline in response with time. However, the time course of adaptation varied among units. All the C-fiber nociceptors and one-half of the A-fiber nociceptors had rapidly adapting responses. The remainder of the A-fibers displayed slowly adapting responses. One-third of all units also showed short-duration increases in firing rate during stimulation. The latency after stimulus onset of this rate acceleration was inversely related to stimulus intensity. Despite the apparent disparity between perceptual temporal summation and nociceptor adaptation, central and peripheral mechanisms are proposed that can reconcile the relationship between nociceptor activity and pain perception.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding question in taste research concerns taste coding and, in particular, how broadly are individual taste bud cells tuned to taste qualities (sweet, bitter, umami, salty, and sour). Taste bud cells express G-protein-coupled receptors for sweet, bitter, or umami tastes but not in combination. However, responses to multiple taste qualities have been recorded in individual taste cells. We and others have shown previously there are two classes of taste bud cells directly involved in gustatory signaling: “receptor” (type II) cells that detect and transduce sweet, bitter, and umami compounds, and “presynaptic” (type III) cells. We hypothesize that receptor cells transmit their signals to presynaptic cells. This communication between taste cells could represent a potential convergence of taste information in the taste bud, resulting in taste cells that would respond broadly to multiple taste stimuli. We tested this hypothesis using calcium imaging in a lingual slice preparation. Here, we show that receptor cells are indeed narrowly tuned: 82% responded to only one taste stimulus. In contrast, presynaptic cells are broadly tuned: 83% responded to two or more different taste qualities. Receptor cells responded to bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli but rarely to sour or salty stimuli. Presynaptic cells responded to all taste qualities, including sour and salty. These data further elaborate functional differences between receptor cells and presynaptic cells, provide strong evidence for communication within the taste bud, and resolve the paradox of broad taste cell tuning despite mutually exclusive receptor expression.",

H values range from 0.0 for narrow tuning to 1.0 for broad tuning. Based on the responses of depolarizing receptor potentials of 26 rat taste cells to the four basic taste stimuli, taste cells were classified into nine NaCl-best, four Q-HCl (quinine-HCl)-best, 10 HCl-best and three sucrose-best cells. NaCl-best cells were narrowly tuned to the four basic taste stimuli, but the other three stimuli-best cells were broadly tuned to the stimuli. In all, 85% of the taste cells responded to more than one of four basic taste stimuli. The mean H values for NaCl-best, Q-HCl-best, HCl-best and sucrose-best cells were 0.285, 0.832, 0.781 and 0.796 respectively. The mean H value for all 26 taste cells was 0.621. This was larger than H in rat gustatory fibers. Transformation of large H values in taste cells into small H values in taste fibers may be due to a non-random interaction between taste cells and taste fibers during the synaptic formation. Broad tuning properties of rat taste cells suggest that the across-taste cell response pattern may play an important role in taste quality coding mechanisms.",

Here, we show that ion channels responsible for voltage-gated (VG) outward currents in type II cells are ATP permeable and demonstrate a strong correlation between the magnitude of the VG current and the intensity of ATP release. These findings suggest that slowly deactivating ion channels transporting the VG outward currents can also mediate ATP secretion in type II cells. In line with this inference, we studied a dependence of ATP secretion on membrane voltage with a cellular ATP sensor using different pulse protocols. These were designed on the basis of predictions of a model of voltage-dependent transient ATP efflux. Consistently with curves that were simulated for ATP release mediated by ATP-permeable channels deactivating slowly, the bell-like and Langmuir isotherm–like potential dependencies were characteristic of ATP secretion obtained for prolonged and short electrical stimulations of taste cells, respectively. These observations strongly support the idea that ATP is primarily released via slowly deactivating channels. Depolarizing voltage pulses produced negligible Ca2+ transients in the cytoplasm of cells releasing ATP, suggesting that ATP secretion is mainly governed by membrane voltage under our recording conditions. With the proviso that natural connexons and pannexons are kinetically similar to exogenously expressed hemichannels, our findings suggest that VG ATP release in type II cells is primarily mediated by Cx hemichannels.",

However, because previous functional data on peripheral coding were mainly collected from inferior vertebrates, it has been difficult to document the degree of specificity of odor interaction mechanisms. As a matter of fact, studies of the functional expression of olfactory receptors have not demonstrated the low or high specificity of olfactory receptors. In this study, the selectivity of olfactory receptor neurons was investigated in the rat at the cellular level under physiological conditions by unitary extracellular recordings. Individual olfactory receptor neurons were broadly responsive to qualitatively distinct odor compounds. We conclude that peripheral coding is based on activated arrays of olfactory receptor cells with overlapping tuning profiles.",

            "abstract": "Recent research on cellular mechanisms of peripheral taste has defined transduction pathways involving membrane receptors, G proteins, second messengers, and ion channels. Receptors for organic tastants received much attention, because they provide the specificity of a response. Their future cloning will constitute a major advance. Taste transduction typically utilizes two or more pathways in parallel. For instance, sweet-sensitive taste cells of the rat appear to respond to sucrose with activation of adenylyl cyclase, followed by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent membrane events and Ca2+ uptake. The same cells respond differently to some artificial sweeteners, i.e., with activation of phospholipase C (PLC) followed by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Some bitter tastants block K+ channels or initiate the cascade receptor G1 protein, PLC, IP3, and Ca2+ release or the cascade receptor alpha-gustducin, phosphodiesterase (PDE), cAMP decrease, and opening of cAMP-blocked channels. Membrane-permeant bitter tastants may elicit a cellular response by interacting with G protein, PLC, or PDE of the above cascades. Salt taste is initiated by current flowing into the taste cell through cation channels located in the apical membrane, even though basolateral channels may also contribute (following salt diffusion through paracellular pathways). In rodents, the Na+-specific component of salt taste is typically mediated by apical amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels, but less specific and not amiloride-sensitive taste components exist in addition. Sour taste may in part be mediated by amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels conducting protons, but other mechanisms certainly contribute. Thus the transduction of taste cells generally comprises parallel pathways. Furthermore, the transduction pathways vary with the location of taste buds on the tongue and, of course, across species of animals. To identify these pathways, to understand how they are controlled and why they evolved to this complexity are major goals of present research.",

            "abstract": "The tastes of many bitter and sweet compounds are thought to be transduced via guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptors, although the biochemical nature of these receptors is poorly understood at present. Gustducin, a taste-specific G-protein closely related to the transducins, is a key component in transducing the responses to compounds that humans equate with bitter and sweet. Rod transducin, which is also expressed in taste receptor cells, can be activated by the bitter compound denatonium in the presence of bovine taste membranes. In this paper, we show that gustducin is expressed in bovine taste tissue and that both gustducin and transducin, in the presence of bovine taste membranes, can be activated specifically by several bitter compounds, including denatonium, quinine, and strychnine. We also demonstrate that the activation in response to denatonium of gustducin by presumptive bitter-responsive receptors present in taste membranes depends on an interaction with the C terminus of gustducin and requires G-protein betagamma subunits to provide the receptor-interacting heterotrimer. The taste receptor-gustducin interaction can be competitively inhibited by peptides derived from the sites of interaction of rhodopsin and transducin. Finally, as the initial step toward purifying taste receptors, we have solubilized this bitter-responsive taste receptor and maintained its biological activity.",

            "title": "Proton currents through amiloride-sensitive Na channels in hamster taste cells. Role in acid transduction",
            "abstract": "The activity of taste cells maintained in the intact hamster tongue was monitored in response to acid stimulation by recording action currents from taste receptor cells with an extracellular \"macro\" patch pipette: a glass pipette was pressed over the taste pore of fungiform papillae and perfused with citric acid, hydrochloric acid, or NaCl. Because this technique restricted stimulus application to the small surface area of the apical membranes of the taste cells, many nonspecific, and potentially detrimental, effects of acid stimulation could be avoided. Acid stimulation reliably elicited fast transient currents (action currents of average amplitude, 9 pA) which were consistently smaller than those elicited by NaCl (29 pA). The frequency of action currents elicited by acid stimuli increased in a dose-dependent manner with decreasing pH from a threshold of about pH 5.0. Acid-elicited responses were independent of K+, Na+, Cl-, or Ca2+ at physiological (salivary) concentrations, and were unaffected by anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, tetraethylammonium bromide, diisothiocyanate-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, vanadate, or Cd2+. In contrast, amiloride (< or = 30 microM) fully and reversibly suppressed acid-evoked action currents. At submaximal amiloride concentrations, the frequency and amplitude of the action currents were reduced, indicating a reduction of the taste cell apical conductance concomitant with a decrease in cell excitation. Exposure to low pH elicited, in addition to transient currents, an amiloride-sensitive sustained d.c. current. This current is apparently carried by protons instead of Na+ through amiloride-sensitive channels. When citric acid was applied while the taste bud was stimulated by NaCl, the action currents became smaller and the response resembled that produced by acid alone. Because of the strong interdependence of the acid and salt (NaCl) responses when both stimuli are applied simultaneously, and because of the similarity in the concentration dependence of amiloride block, we conclude that amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels on hamster taste receptor cells are permeable to protons and may play a role in acid (sour) taste.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that mudpuppy taste receptor cells respond to sour taste stimuli (weak acids) with depolarizing receptor potentials or action potentials that are blocked by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium. Voltage-clamp recordings from isolated taste cells indicated that taste receptor cells exhibit a variety of voltage-dependent conductances and that acids reduce a voltage-dependent K+ current. Since taste stimuli are restricted to the apical surface of the intact tongue, only 1-2% of the taste receptor cell surface is exposed to chemical stimuli. Thus, modification of a K+ conductance would be an effective transduction mechanism in receptor cells only if the majority of K+ channels were located on the apical membrane. We have used a combination of \"loose-patch\" and whole-cell recording methods to map the distribution of voltage-sensitive K+ and Na+ channels on dissociated Necturus maculosus taste cells. We report here that the K+ conductance is approximately equal to 50-fold greater on apical membrane than on basolateral membrane, whereas the Na+ conductance is distributed evenly. The marked nonuniformity of the voltage-sensitive K+ conductance, together with the block of this conductance by sour stimuli, indicates that K+ current modulation is the mechanism of sour taste transduction.",

Taste sensibilities of neurons in mammalian glossopharyngeal nerves have been inadequately studied, although they innervate the majority of taste buds and may provide unique taste information. 2. Extracellular responses of glossopharyngeal neural units to taste stimuli infused into foliate or vallate papillae were recorded in anesthetized rats. A 0.3-ml/min infusion of stimuli into papillae resulted in short-latency, 5-s nerve-impulse rates that approached 10 times the response rates observed using less invasive means of stimulation. 3. Sucrose, Na saccharin, NaCl, NH4Cl, KCl, HCl, citric acid, acetic acid, MgSO4, and quinine.HCl were effective stimuli for glossopharyngeal neurons at concentrations that have behavioral significance. 4. Response spectra for individual neural units with either foliate or vallate receptive fields fell into three clusters. Forty-six percent were A units that responded most strongly to acids and chloride salts, NH4Cl being the most effective; neither quinine nor sucrose was effective. Twenty-three percent were S units that responded to sugars and saccharin; quinine, salts, and acids were not effective. Thirty-one percent were Q units that responded to quinine; neither NaCl, HCl, nor sucrose was effective stimulus for these fragile units. 5. Glossopharyngeal A neural units were more sensitive to 1 mM HCl than were electrolyte-sensitive H units of the chorda tympani, although both respond generally to salts and acids. Units relatively specific for sodium salts (N units), which are common in the chorda tympani nerve, were not found in the glossopharyngeal nerve, which explains losses in sodium-specific behavior after cutting only the chorda tympani nerve. 6. Q units were the only glossopharyngeal neural units that responded significantly to quinine, and units with similar response spectra do not occur in the chorda tympani nerve. Q units probably mediate aversive reflexes to quinine that are eliminated by cutting only the glossopharyngeal nerve. Glossopharyngeal S neural units were more sensitive to sucrose and are more common than their counterparts in the chorda tympani, although it is not known how they might compare with sugar-sensitive units in the greater superficial petrosal nerve. 7. These data strongly suggest that posterior taste bud fields innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve are specialized for functions different from those of anterior taste bud fields innervated by the facial nerve.",

In the present study, polyclonal antibodies against P2X1 to P2X6 receptors were used to localize P2X receptors in circumvallate and fungiform papillae of rats. Nerve fibres innervating the taste buds stained intensely with P2X3 receptor antibodies. P2X3 receptor-positive nerves were observed in the intra- and subgemmal regions. The nerve fibres were also stained with P2X2 receptor antibodies, but the intensity was much lower. The distribution of P2X2 receptor immunoreactivity overlaps with that of P2X3. These results suggest that ATP might be a neurotransmitter in taste reception cells in the taste buds, where it transducts the taste signals to the afferent taste nerves by activating P2X receptors at the synapses. This is the first experiment indicating such a role for ATP, although supplementary functional studies are required.",

Sausages were produced containing 5 and 10% ASSPE. Sausages containing ASSPE showed no significant differences in emulsion stability, color, pH, moisture, viable cell count, and VBN compared to the control. The hardness significantly increased with the addition of ASSPE, and sausages containing 5% ASSPE were the highest in gumminess. In the sensory evaluation, sausages containing 5% ASSPE had the highest score in appearance and springiness. In conclusion, the addition of ASSPE in sausage had no effects on storage characteristics, but had a good effect on improvement of quality and sensory characteristics. Especially, 5% ASSPE sausage had good texture and high sensory characteristics due to increased binding capacity. These results suggest that 5% ASSPE may improve the quality and sensory characteristics of sausage.",

Sausages without added fat had higher expressible moisture and texture values, but their lightness and yellowness values were lower, as compared with sausages with 5%, 10%, or 15% fat. Increased fat levels with constant amounts of lean meat and added water increased the lightness and yellowness values, but tended the redness values tended to be similar. Low-fat sausages (LFSs, <3%) containing non-meat proteins, except egg white protein, had reduced texture values similar to those of regular-fat counterparts (RFC). The addition of non-meat proteins, except egg white protein, as components of fat replacers in LFS improved the textural characteristics, making them similar to those of RFC. LFSs containing sodium caseinate had reduced concentrations of pentadecanal and octadecanal, resulting in similar volatile compositions to those of RFC. Thus, sodium caseinate was the best non-meat protein for the improvement of both texture and flavour of LFSs.",

The analysis results in compositions, functionalities, and pigment contents of raw meats were various according to the difference of species and their parts. The cohesiveness was correlated positively with moisture or protein content and negatively with fat content. Consequently two multiple regression equations for bind value could be derived from the compositions of raw meats.

However, cooking yield of LFSPS decreased, while textural properties were increased with the addition of TG-SC combination, which did not affect expressible moisture contents (%) of LFSPS. Both AC and MB tended to improve the cooking yield and water holding capacity of LFSPS, especially, MB rather than AC. However, these had no effect on the textural properties of LFSPS, except for textural chewiness. These results indicated that AC and MB powders could be used as a water binding agent in TG-SC combination of LFSPS.",

The presence of an epithelial cation channel that receives Na+ has previously been reported. However, no molecular entity involving Cl− receptors has been elucidated. We report the strong expression of transmembrane channel-like 4 (TMC4) in the circumvallate and foliate papillae projected to the glossopharyngeal nerve, mediating a high-concentration of NaCl. Electrophysiological analysis using HEK293T cells revealed that TMC4 was a voltage-dependent Cl− channel and the consequent currents were completely inhibited by NPPB, an anion channel blocker. TMC4 allowed permeation of organic anions including gluconate, but their current amplitudes at positive potentials were less than that of Cl−. Tmc4-deficient mice showed significantly weaker glossopharyngeal nerve response to high-concentration of NaCl than the wild-type littermates. These results indicated that TMC4 is a novel chloride channel that responds to high-concentration of NaCl.",

            "title": "Voltage dependence of the rat chorda tympani response to Na+ salts: implications for the functional organization of taste receptor cells.",
            "abstract": "1. Voltage-clamp and current-clamp data were obtained from a circumscribed region of the anterior rat lingual epithelium while simultaneously monitoring the afferent, stimulus-evoked, neural response from the same receptive field. 2. Chorda tympani (CT) responses at constant Na(+)-salt concentration were enhanced by submucosa negative voltage clamp and suppressed by positive voltage clamp. The complete CT response profile, including the time course of adaptation, was not uniquely determined by NaCl concentration alone. The response could be reproduced at different NaCl concentrations by applying a compensating voltage. 3. The form of the concentration and voltage dependence of the CT response indicates that the complete stimulus energy is the Na+ electrochemical potential difference across receptor cell apical membranes, and not Na+ concentration alone. This is the underlying principal behind the equivalence of chemical and electric taste for Na+ salts. 4. CT responses to sodium gluconate (25 and 200 mM) and 25 mM NaCl produced amiloride-insensitive components (AIC) of low magnitude. NaCl at 200 mM produced a significantly larger AIC. The AIC was voltage-clamp independent. The relative magnitude of the AIC was positively correlated with the transepithelial conductance of each salt. This suggests that the large AIC for 200 mM NaCl results from its relatively high permeability through the paracellular pathway. 5. Analysis of the CT response under voltage clamp revealed two anion effects on Na(+)-salt taste, both of which act through the paracellular shunt. 1) Anions modify the transepithelial potential (TP) across tight junctions and thereby modulate the cell receptor potential. This anion effect can be eliminated by voltage clamping the TP. 2) Sufficiently mobile anions facilitate electroneutral diffusion of Na+ salts through tight junctions. This effect is observed especially when Cl- is the anion and when the stimulus concentration favors NaCl influx, allowing Na+ to stimulate receptor cells from the submucosal side. Because the submucosal intercellular spaces are nearly isopotential regions, this effect is insensitive to voltage clamp of the TP. The large AIC associated with this anion effect is due to the low permeability of amiloride.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundTaste bud cells transmit information regarding the contents of food from taste receptors embedded in apical microvilli to gustatory nerve fibers innervating basolateral membranes. In particular, taste cells depolarize, activate voltage-gated sodium channels, and fire action potentials in response to tastants. Initial cell depolarization is attributable to sodium influx through TRPM5 in sweet, bitter, and umami cells and an undetermined cation influx through an ion channel in sour cells expressing PKD2L1, a candidate sour taste receptor. The molecular identity of the voltage-gated sodium channels that sense depolarizing signals and subsequently initiate action potentials coding taste information to gustatory nerve fibers is unknown.ResultsWe describe the molecular and histological expression profiles of cation channels involved in electrical signal transmission from apical to basolateral membrane domains. TRPM5 was positioned immediately beneath tight junctions to receive calcium signals originating from sweet, bitter, and umami receptor activation, while PKD2L1 was positioned at the taste pore. Using mouse taste bud and lingual epithelial cells collected by laser capture microdissection, SCN2A, SCN3A, and SCN9A voltage-gated sodium channel transcripts were expressed in taste tissue. SCN2A, SCN3A, and SCN9A were expressed beneath tight junctions in subsets of taste cells. SCN3A and SCN9A were expressed in TRPM5 cells, while SCN2A was expressed in TRPM5 and PKD2L1 cells. HCN4, a gene previously implicated in sour taste, was expressed in PKD2L1 cells and localized to cell processes beneath the taste pore.ConclusionSCN2A, SCN3A and SCN9A voltage-gated sodium channels are positioned to sense initial depolarizing signals stemming from taste receptor activation and initiate taste cell action potentials. SCN2A, SCN3A and SCN9A gene products likely account for the tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents in taste receptor cells.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundTaste buds are the sensory organs of taste perception. Three types of taste cells have been described. Type I cells have voltage-gated outward currents, but lack voltage-gated inward currents. These cells have been presumed to play only a support role in the taste bud. Type II cells have voltage-gated Na+ and K+ current, and the receptors and transduction machinery for bitter, sweet, and umami taste stimuli. Type III cells have voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ currents, and make prominent synapses with afferent nerve fibers. Na+ salt transduction in part involves amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). In rodents, these channels are located in taste cells of fungiform papillae on the anterior part of the tongue innervated by the chorda tympani nerve. However, the taste cell type that expresses ENaCs is not known. This study used whole cell recordings of single fungiform taste cells of transgenic mice expressing GFP in Type II taste cells to identify the taste cells responding to amiloride. We also used immunocytochemistry to further define and compare cell types in fungiform and circumvallate taste buds of these mice.ResultsTaste cell types were identified by their response to depolarizing voltage steps and their presence or absence of GFP fluorescence. TRPM5-GFP taste cells expressed large voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents, but lacked voltage-gated Ca2+ currents, as expected from previous studies. Approximately half of the unlabeled cells had similar membrane properties, suggesting they comprise a separate population of Type II cells. The other half expressed voltage-gated outward currents only, typical of Type I cells. A single taste cell had voltage-gated Ca2+ current characteristic of Type III cells. Responses to amiloride occurred only in cells that lacked voltage-gated inward currents. Immunocytochemistry showed that fungiform taste buds have significantly fewer Type II cells expressing PLC signalling components, and significantly fewer Type III cells than circumvallate taste buds.ConclusionThe principal finding is that amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels appear to be expressed in cells that lack voltage-gated inward currents, likely the Type I taste cells. These cells were previously assumed to provide only a support function in the taste bud.",

            "abstract": "Salt taste in mammals can trigger two divergent behavioural responses. In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a non-selective detector for a wide range of salts. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities—sweet, sour, bitter and umami—are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCα in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice.",

Here we show that ANO and TMC proteins share high sequence similarity and probably the same membrane topology, indicating that these proteins are evolutionarily related. We found many conserved amino acid residues between the two families of proteins, especially in regions spanning the transmembrane domains TM1, TM4-TM5, and TM6-TM7. These findings imply that these proteins form one large family, which we term ANO/TMC superfamily and that TMC proteins also function as channels for Cl- or other ions. The ANO/TMC superfamily proteins are present in almost all diverse groups of eukaryotic organisms, suggesting that the proteins function in important biological processes, such as ion homeostasis, in eukaryotic cells.",

Neurotransmitter release is modulated by intracellular calcium levels. Large Ca2+-dependent chloride currents are important regulators of synaptic transmission from photoreceptors to second-order neurons; the molecular basis underlying these currents is unclear. We cloned human and mouse TMEM16B, a member of the TMEM16 family of transmembrane proteins, and show that it is abundantly present in the photoreceptor synaptic terminals in mouse retina. TMEM16B colocalizes with adaptor proteins PSD95, VELI3, and MPP4 at the ribbon synapses and contains a consensus PDZ class I binding motif capable of interacting with PDZ domains of PSD95. Furthermore, TMEM16B is lost from photoreceptor membranes of MPP4-deficient mice. This suggests that TMEM16B is a novel component of a presynaptic protein complex recruited to specialized plasma membrane domains of photoreceptors. TMEM16B confers Ca2+-dependent chloride currents when overexpressed in mammalian cells as measured by halide sensitive fluorescent protein assays and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The compartmentalized localization and the electrophysiological properties suggest TMEM16B to be a strong candidate for the long sought-after Ca2+-dependent chloride channel in the photoreceptor synapse.",

            "abstract": "1. Taste receptor cells produce action potentials as a result of transduction mechanisms that occur when these cells are stimulated with tastants. These action potentials are thought to be key signaling events in relaying information to the central nervous system. We explored the ionic basis of action potentials from dissociated posterior rat taste cells using the patch-clamp recording technique in both voltage-clamp and current-clamp modes. 2. Action potentials were evoked by intracellular injection of depolarizing current pulses from a holding potential of -80 mV. The threshold potential for firing of action potentials was approximately -35 mV; the input resistance of these cells averaged 6.9 G omega. With long depolarizing pulses, two or three action potentials could be elicited with successive attenuation of the spike height. Afterhyperpolarizations were observed often. 3. Both sodium and calcium currents contribute to depolarizing phases of the action potential. Action potentials were blocked completely in the presence of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin. Calcium contributions could be visualized as prolonged calcium plateaus when repolarizing potassium currents were blocked and barium was used as a charge carrier. 4. Outward currents were composed of sustained delayed rectifier current, transient potassium current, and calcium-activated potassium current. Transient and sustained potassium currents activated close to -30 mV and increased monotonically with further depolarization. Up to half the outward current inactivated with decay constants on the order of seconds. Sustained and transient currents displayed steep voltage dependence in conductance and inactivation curves. Half inactivation occurred at -20 +/- 3.1 mV (mean +/- SE) with a decrease of 11.2 +/- 0.5 mV per e-fold. Half maximal conductance occurred at 3.6 +/- 1.8 mV and increased 12.2 +/- 0.6 mV per e-fold. Calcium-activated potassium current was evidenced by application of apamin and the use of calcium-free bathing solution. It was most obvious at more depolarized holding potentials that inactivated much of the transient and sustained outward currents. 5. Potassium currents contribute to both the repolarization and afterhyperpolarization phases of the action potential. These currents were blocked by bath application of tetraethylammonium, which also substantially broadened the action potential. Application of 4-aminopyridine was able to selectively block transient potassium currents without affecting sustained currents. This also broadened the action potential as well as eliminated the afterhyperpolarization. 6. A second type of action potential was observed that differed in duration. These slow action potentials had t1/2 durations of 9.6 ms compared with 1.4 ms for fast action potentials. Input resistances of the two groups were indistinguishable. Approximately one-fourth of the cells eliciting action potentials were of the slow type. 7. Cells eliciting fast action potentials had large outward currents capable of producing a quick repolarization, whereas cells with slow action potentials had small outward currents by comparison. The average values of fast cells were 2,563 pA and 1.4 ms compared with 373 pA and 9.6 ms for slow cells. Current and duration values were related exponentially. No significant difference was noted for inward currents. 8. These results suggest that many taste receptor cells conduct action potentials, which may be classified broadly into two groups on the basis of action potential duration and potassium current magnitude. These groups may be related to cell turnover. The physiological role of action potentials remains to be elucidated but may be important for communication within the taste bud as well as to the afferent nerve.",

            "title": "The Role of the Anion in Salt (NaCl) Detection by Mouse Taste Buds",
            "abstract": "How taste buds detect NaCl remains poorly understood. Among other problems, applying taste-relevant concentrations of NaCl (50–500 mm) onto isolated taste buds or cells exposes them to unphysiological (hypo/hypertonic) conditions. To overcome these limitations, we used the anterior tongue of male and female mice to implement a slice preparation in which fungiform taste buds are in a relatively intact tissue environment and stimuli are limited to the taste pore. Taste-evoked responses were monitored using confocal Ca2+ imaging via GCaMP3 expressed in Type 2 and Type 3 taste bud cells. NaCl evoked intracellular mobilization of Ca2+ in the apical tips of a subset of taste cells. The concentration dependence and rapid adaptation of NaCl-evoked cellular responses closely resembled behavioral and afferent nerve responses to NaCl. Importantly, taste cell responses were not inhibited by the diuretic, amiloride. Post hoc immunostaining revealed that >80% of NaCl-responsive taste bud cells were of Type 2. Many NaCl-responsive cells were also sensitive to stimuli that activate Type 2 cells but never to stimuli for Type 3 cells. Ion substitutions revealed that amiloride-insensitive NaCl responses depended on Cl− rather than Na+. Moreover, choline chloride, an established salt taste enhancer, was equally effective a stimulus as sodium chloride. Although the apical transducer for Cl− remains unknown, blocking known chloride channels and cotransporters had little effect on NaCl responses. Together, our data suggest that chloride, an essential nutrient, is a key determinant of taste transduction for amiloride-insensitive salt taste. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sodium and chloride are essential nutrients and must be regularly consumed to replace excreted NaCl. Thus, understanding salt taste, which informs salt appetite, is important from a fundamental sensory perspective and forms the basis for interventions to replace/reduce excess Na+ consumption. This study examines responses to NaCl in a semi-intact preparation of mouse taste buds. We identify taste cells that respond to NaCl in the presence of amiloride, which is significant because much of human salt taste also is amiloride-insensitive. Further, we demonstrate that Cl−, not Na+, generates these amiloride-insensitive salt taste responses. Intriguingly, choline chloride, a commercial salt taste enhancer, is also a highly effective stimulus for these cells.",

            "abstract": "TMEM16A (ANO1) functions as a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). We developed pharmacological tools to investigate the contribution of TMEM16A to CaCC conductance in human airway and intestinal epithelial cells. A screen of ∼110,000 compounds revealed four novel chemical classes of small molecule TMEM16A inhibitors that fully blocked TMEM16A chloride current with an IC50 < 10 μm, without interfering with calcium signaling. Following structure-activity analysis, the most potent inhibitor, an aminophenylthiazole (T16Ainh-A01), had an IC50 of ∼1 μm. Two distinct types of inhibitors were identified. Some compounds, such as tannic acid and the arylaminothiophene CaCCinh-A01, fully inhibited CaCC current in human bronchial and intestinal cells. Other compounds, including T16Ainh-A01 and digallic acid, inhibited total CaCC current in these cells poorly, but blocked mainly an initial, agonist-stimulated transient chloride current. TMEM16A RNAi knockdown also inhibited mainly the transient chloride current. In contrast to the airway and intestinal cells, all TMEM16A inhibitors fully blocked CaCC current in salivary gland cells. We conclude that TMEM16A carries nearly all CaCC current in salivary gland epithelium, but is a minor contributor to total CaCC current in airway and intestinal epithelia. The small molecule inhibitors identified here permit pharmacological dissection of TMEM16A/CaCC function and are potential development candidates for drug therapy of hypertension, pain, diarrhea, and excessive mucus production.",

These hydrolysates were passed through ultrafiltration membranes to obtain peptide fractions of different sizes (<1, 1-3, 3-5 and 5-10 kDa). The hydrolysates and their peptide fractions were investigated for antioxidant activities. The membrane fractions showed that peptides with sizes <3 kDa had significantly (p < 0.05) reduced surface hydrophobicity when compared with peptides >3 kDa. This is in agreement with the result obtained for the ferric reducing power, metal chelating and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities where higher molecular weight peptides exhibited better activity (p < 0.05) when compared to low molecular weight peptide fractions. However, for all the hydrolysates, the low molecular weight peptides were more effective diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers but not superoxide radicals when compared to the bigger peptides. In comparison with glutathione (GSH), BPHs and their membrane fractions had better (p < 0.05) reducing power and ability to chelate metal ions except for the pepsin hydrolysate and its membrane fractions that did not show any metal chelating activity. However, the 5-10 kDa pepsin hydrolysate peptide fractions had greater (88%) hydroxyl scavenging activity than GSH, alcalase and trypsin hydrolysates (82%). These findings show the potential use of BPHs and their peptide fraction as antioxidants in reducing food spoilage or management of oxidative stress-related metabolic disorders.",

Inhibitors of ACE are a first line of therapy for hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy. Notably, these inhibitors were developed without knowledge of the structure of human ACE, but were instead designed on the basis of an assumed mechanistic homology with carboxypeptidase A. Here we present the X-ray structure of human testicular ACE and its complex with one of the most widely used inhibitors, lisinopril (N2-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-l-lysyl-l-proline; also known as Prinivil or Zestril), at 2.0 Å resolution. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of ACE shows that it bears little similarity to that of carboxypeptidase A, but instead resembles neurolysin and Pyrococcus furiosus carboxypeptidase—zinc metallopeptidases with no detectable sequence similarity to ACE. The structure provides an opportunity to design domain-selective ACE inhibitors that may exhibit new pharmacological profiles.",

In the present study, bambara protein hydrolysates (BPHs) obtained using three different proteases (alcalase, trypsin and pepsin) and their peptide fractions (molecular weight: 10, 5, 3 and 1 kDa) were investigated for antihypertensive and antioxidant activities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlcalase hydrolysate contained the highest amount of low molecular weight (LMW) peptides compared to pepsin and trypsin hydrolysates. LMW peptides fractions (<1 kDa) exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) for all the enzymes hydrolysates. For renin inhibition, alcalase hydrolysate showed the highest inhibition at 59% compared to other hydrolysates and their corresponding membrane fractions. The antioxidant power of bambara protein hydrolysates and peptide fractions was evaluated through the inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation and ABTS scavenging activity. Among the hydrolysates, alcalase exhibited the highest inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation. Furthermore, all BPHs were able to scavenge ABTS•+ to a three-fold greater extent compared to the isolate.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBPH and LMW peptide fractions could potentially serve as useful ingredients in the formulation of functional foods and nutraceuticals against high blood pressure and oxidative stress. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) is an underutilized legume with relatively high protein content (~24%). Protein hydrolysates were prepared from pea isolate by enzymatic hydrolysis using pepsin and pancreatin. Hydrolysates were evaluated for their amino acid composition, antioxidant properties, in vitro and in vivo antihypertensive properties. The hydrolysates had high hydrophobic amino acids, especially isoleucine, phenylalanine, and leucine. Pepsin‐pancreatin‐hydrolyzed pea protein (PPHPp) showed significantly higher ability to scavenge DPPH˙ while pancreatin‐hydrolyzed pea protein (PPHPa) had higher ˙OH, ABTS˙+ scavenging, Fe3+ reducing and linoleic acid peroxidation inhibition. PPHPp exhibited superior angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibition (61.82%) while PPHPa showed higher renin inhibition (14.28%). PPHPp exhibited strong antihypertensive effect, showing an instantaneous systolic blood pressure lowering effect (−26.12 mmHg) within 2‐h post‐oral administration. Pigeon pea protein hydrolysate (especially from pancreatin digest) could therefore, be a promising source of bioactive peptides and potential ingredient for formulation of functional foods against oxidative stress and hypertension.",

Fractions I (>10 kDa), II (3–10 kDa) and III (<3 kDa) with yield of 13.4, 18.4 and 66.6%, respectively. Antioxidant activity of PVPH and its fractions was determined in terms of radical-scavenging activity (RSA), reducing power (RP), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and antioxidant activity index (AAI). PVPH exhibited excellent RSA and TAA at peptide concentration of 0.2 and 2.0 mg/mL, respectively. It also showed RP value as 0.4, and AAI as 500 after 100 min at peptide concentration of 9 and 30 mg/mL, respectively. Scavenging of 2, 2′-azinobis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) and hydroxyl radicals by Fraction III was found to be significantly higher than other fractions, while superoxide scavenging activity was independent of peptide size. Fraction I exhibited better RP, TAA and AAI.

            "abstract": "The aim of this work was to produce wonderful cola protein hydrolysate fractions with in vitro antioxidant properties coupled with blood pressure-reducing ability when orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Wonderful cola protein isolate (WCI) was hydrolyzed with pancreatin to produce a hydrolysate (WCH), which was subjected to ultrafiltration separation using 1, 3, 5, and 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes to obtain <1, 1–3, 3–5 and 5–10 kDa peptide fractions, respectively. The <1 and 1–3 kDa fractions had higher contents of arginine when compared to the 3–5 and 5–10 kDa peptides. The WCH and <1 kDa peptide fraction had significantly (p < 0.05) better DPPH radical scavenging (55–67%) and metal chelation (83–93%) activities but lower hydroxyl radical scavenging power (10–32%) than the WCI (46, 46 and 63%, respectively). The <1 kDa had significantly (p < 0.05) higher in vitro inhibition (80%) of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity while the 5–10 kDa was the most active inhibitor (90%) of renin activity. All peptide fractions so produced had better systolic and diastolic blood pressure-lowering effects than WCH and WCI. However, the <1 kDa fraction produced significantly (p < 0.05) stronger systolic (−33 mmHg) and diastolic (−30 mmHg) blood pressure reductions 6 h after oral gavage to SHRs. Thus, wonderful cola proteins contain encrypted bioactive peptides that may be used to formulate antioxidant and antihypertensive products.",

In Experiment 1 (E1) sweetness, sourness, liking and intensity ratings were obtained for 20 odours. Taste ratings were then obtained for sucrose solutions to which the odours had been added as flavorants. Certain odours were found to enhance tasted sweetness while others suppressed it. The degree to which an odour smelled sweet was the best predictor of the taste ratings. These findings were extended in Experiment 2 (E2), which included a second tastant, citric acid, and employed four odours from E1. The most sweet smelling odour, caramel, was found to suppress the sourness of citric acid and, as in E1, to enhance the sweetness of sucrose. Again, odours with low sweetness suppressed the sweetness of tasted sucrose. The study demonstrated that the effects of odours on taste perception are not limited to sweetness enhancement and apply to sour as well as sweet tastes. The overall pattern of results is consistent with an explanation of the taste properties of odours in terms of prior flavour-taste associations.",

Inconsistencies in the degrees of suppression in the imaginary condition suggested that participants did not base their responses on the inspection of a mental image but on incomplete implicit or explicit knowledge of sensory interactions. Participants knew the phenomenon of mixture suppression and knew that its effects were level dependent, but they were unable to predict the exact intensity of a mixture on the basis of the intensities of its unmixed components.",

The tastant used was sucrose, and the two odorants were strawberry and ham. In the first experiment, participants either smelled or imagined one of two odors during taste detection tasks (between-subject design), whereas in the second one, subjects completed both the odor imagery and perception conditions with taste detection tasks (within-subject design). The effect was odorant-specific: detection of sucrose was significantly better when subjects smelled strawberry than when they smelled ham. Furthermore, imagined odors influenced taste perception in the same way as did perceived odors. We concluded that the odor-specific effect on taste perception is an authentic perceptual phenomenon. Our results also support the notion that odor-induced changes in taste perception are mediated centrally. Finally, our findings are in agreement with reports supporting the existence of odor imagery.",

This research examined enhancement of ratings when response alternatives were limited in time-intensity scaling tasks using repeated category ratings.

The aromatic flavor caused an increase in sweetness intensity and especially so when the panelists were limited to sweetness responses only. The odor-induced enhancement of sweetness was smaller when panelists were given both flavor and sweetness response options than when the panelists were given only a sweetness scale. Prior use of both scales in a previous experimental session did not lessen the halo-dumping enhancement effect. In one study, sweetness ratings of sucrose alone were depressed when the additional scale for flavoring was provided, perhaps due to inappropriate partitioning of responses.",

Like the neurodevelopmental synesthesias, odor-induced experiences involve different sensory modalities; are reliable, asymmetric (concurrents cannot induce), and automatic; and the inducer-concurrent relationship is learnt. Unlike neurodevelopmental synesthesias, these experiences are universal and their synesthetic nature goes unrecognized. Olfaction's ability to universally induce concurrents may result from its unique neuroanatomy, affording dual access to neocortex. We propose that concurrents arise here via a twofold process: by direct neocortical activation, which recovers a configural memory, and by attribution of this memory to the olfactory modality by thalamic attentional processes. The implications of this for other forms of synesthesia are then examined.",

            "abstract": "The sense of smell plays a major role in food flavour perception: Individuals who loose their sense of smell often report that food has no taste anymore. Yet, from a neuroanatomical point of view taste and smell are very different senses. Taste is perceived primarily on the tongue whereas odours are perceived in the upper part of the nasal cavity either directly or via the back of the mouth. But does this neuroanatomical dissociation imply that taste and odour perception are independent? Probably not! Indeed, information coming from the gustatory and the olfactory systems are likely to be combined at a higher level of processing in the brain to give rise to a unique perception referred to as ”flavour” (1), (28). The question thus is: What is the nature of this combination? Is it an additive combination whereby taste and odour perception are simply added to form an overall perception or can we observe interactions between taste and odours? In this context, taste odour interaction refers to a modification in perceived taste intensity in the presence of an odour. For example, a sweet solution will taste sweeter in the presence of a vanilla aroma even though the vanilla aroma possesses no taste properties. The aim of this chapter is to examine whether such interactions exist for sweet taste perception. We begin with an overview of the literature on the effect of odour",

Orally, 10 of 19 subjects rated solutions containing C and citric acid (CA) significantly higher than those containing CA alone. Retronasally, citral intensity was enhanced by CA > CA + sucrose (SUC) > SUC > NaCl. Addition of xanthan gum had little effect on perception of citral. Retronasal intensity of vanillin solutions was increased by addition of sucrose (SUC) and depressed by CA and by NaCl. the results demonstrated large differences in perceived intensity and duration via the three procedures, significant alteration of oral intensity by added tastants, and marked bimodality of response upon the addition of acid to citral.",

The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor is the best-known G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) able to sense external Ca2+ changes. Widely recognized as a fundamental player in systemic Ca2+ homeostasis, the CaR is ubiquitously expressed in the human body where it activates multiple signalling pathways. In this review, old and new notions regarding the mechanisms by which extracellular Ca2+ microdomains are created and the tools available to measure them are analyzed. After a survey of the main signalling pathways triggered by the CaR, a special attention is reserved for the emerging concepts regarding CaR function in the heart, CaR trafficking and pharmacology. Finally, an overview on other Ca2+ sensors is provided.",

            "abstract": "The reduced expression level of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is attributed to the hyposensitivity of parathyroid cells to extracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]o, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients and rats with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). Calcimimetic compounds have been demonstrated to improve the decreased sensitivity of CaR to extracellular calcium concentration and to suppress both parathyroid hormone (PTH) oversecretion and parathyroid cell proliferation. However, the effect of calcimimetics on the reduced CaR expression level in parathyroid cells in CRI remains unclarified. The aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of the calcimimetic compound NSP R-568 (R-568) on the CaR expression in the parathyroid cells of rats with experimental CRI. Subtotally nephrectomized rats were fed a high-phosphorus diet for 8 (n = 12; Nx-8 group) or 9 wk (n = 11; Nx-9 group) to induce severe SHPT. Another group of uremic rats were fed a high-phosphorus diet for 8 wk and then orally administered R-568 (100 micromol/kg body wt) once a day for 7 d (n = 11; Nx+R-568 group). Sham-operated rats that were fed a standard diet for 9 wk were used as controls (n = 8). R-568 treatment induced a significant reduction in plasma PTH level with significant decrease in serum calcium and without change in serum phosphorus concentration. Serum 1,25(OH)2D3 level was not affected by R-568 administration. CaR mRNA and protein levels in the Nx-8 and Nx-9 groups significantly decreased compared with those in the controls; however, no significant difference in these parameters was observed between the Nx-8 and Nx-9 groups. In the Nx+R-568 group, CaR mRNA and protein levels significantly increased compared with those in either the Nx-8 or Nx-9 group. R-568 was effective in reducing the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells along with parathyroid gland growth suppression in the Nx+R-568 group compared with that in the Nx-9 group. The results suggest that the calcimimetic compound R-568 upregulates decreased CaR expression, and the upregulation possibly has an enhancement effect on PTH secretion and parathyroid cell hyperplasia through the improved sensitivity of CaR to [Ca2+]o.",

            "abstract": "The presence of the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor on human antral gastrin cells was investigated. Reverse transcription PCR using mRNA isolated from gastrin cell- enriched cell cultures identified a product with a sequence identical to part of the human parathyroid-secreting cell calcium-sensing receptor. Immunocytochemistry with an antibody to the extracellular region of the receptor immunostained all gastrin cells (but not mucin or somatostatin cells), and detected appropriate-sized bands in Western blots of whole cell lysates. Increasing extracellular calcium levels from 0.5 to 9 mM stimulated gastrin release in a concentration-dependent manner, with maximal release obtained at 7.2 mM. A known agonist of the calcium receptor, spermine also stimulated gastrin release. Microfluorimetry of identified gastrin cells demonstrated that increasing extracellular calcium resulted in an initial rapid rise in intracellular calcium followed by a plateau level that returned to basal levels immediately after removal of the elevated calcium. The traces were consistent with activation of a receptor-mediated mechanism rather than a concentration-dependent influx of calcium. In conclusion, these data indicate that G cells express the calcium-sensing receptor, and that activation of the receptor may explain the acid rebound phenomenon associated with calcium-containing antacid preparations.",

            "abstract": "Ca2+-sensing receptors (CaSRs) play a central role in regulating extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o) homeostasis and many (patho)physiological processes in multiple organs. This regulation is orchestrated by a cooperative response to extracellular stimuli such as small changes in Ca2+, Mg2+, amino acids, and other ligands. In addition, CaSR is a pleiotropic receptor regulating several intracellular signaling pathways, including calcium mobilization and intracellular calcium oscillation. Nearly 200 mutations and polymorphisms have been found in CaSR in relation to a variety of human disorders associated with abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis. In this review, we summarize efforts directed at identifying binding sites for calcium and amino acids. Both homotropic cooperativity among multiple calcium binding sites and heterotropic cooperativity between calcium and amino acid were revealed using computational modeling, predictions, and site-directed mutagenesis coupled with functional assays. The hinge region of the bilobed Venus flytrap (VFT) domain of CaSR plays a pivotal role in coordinating multiple extracellular stimuli, leading to cooperative responses from the receptor. We further highlight the extensive number of disease-associated mutations that have also been shown to affect CaSR's cooperative action via several types of mechanisms. These results provide insights into the molecular bases of the structure and functional cooperativity of this receptor and other members of family C of the G protein-coupled receptors (cGPCRs) in health and disease states, and may assist in the prospective development of novel receptor-based therapeutics.",

The SR supplies Ca2+ directly to mitochondria via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) at close contacts between the two organelles referred to as mitochondrion-associated ER membrane (MAM). Although it has been demonstrated that CaR (calcium sensing receptor) activation is involved in intracellular calcium overload during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/Re), the role of CaR activation in the cardiomyocyte apoptotic pathway remains unclear. We postulated that CaR activation plays a role in the regulation of SR-mitochondrial inter-organelle Ca2+ signaling, causing apoptosis during H/Re. To investigate the above hypothesis, cultured cardiomyocytes were subjected to H/Re. We examined the distribution of IP3Rs in cardiomyocytes via immunofluorescence and Western blotting and found that type 3 IP3Rs were located in the SR. [Ca2+]i, [Ca2+]m and [Ca2+]SR were determined using Fluo-4, x-rhod-1 and Fluo 5N, respectively, and the mitochondrial membrane potential was detected with JC-1 during reoxygenation using laser confocal microscopy. We found that activation of CaR reduced [Ca2+]SR, increased [Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]m and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential during reoxygenation. We found that the activation of CaR caused the cleavage of BAP31, thus generating the pro-apoptotic p20 fragment, which induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the translocation of bak/bax to mitochondria. Taken together, these results reveal that CaR activation causes Ca2+ release from the SR into the mitochondria through IP3Rs and induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis during hypoxia/reoxygenation.",

Polyamines are endogenous polyvalent cations that can act as agonists for the CaR, as shown by our current studies of human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells transfected with the human CaR. Cellular parameters altered by polyamines included cytosolic free Ca2+(Cai), inositol phosphate production, and the activity of a nonselective cation channel. Spermine stimulated Cai transients in CaR-transfected HEK cells, with a concentration producing a half-maximal response (EC50) of ∼500 μM in the presence of 0.5 mM Ca2+, whereas sustained increases in Cai had an EC50 of ∼200 μM. The order of potency was spermine > spermidine >> putrescine. Elevation of Cao shifted the EC50 for spermine sharply to the left, with substantial stimulation below 100 μM. Addition of subthreshold concentrations of spermine increased the sensitivity of CaR-expressing HEK cells to Cao. Parathyroid hormone secretion from bovine parathyroid cells was inhibited by 50% in the presence of 200 μM spermine, a response similar to that elicited by 2.0 mM Cao. These data suggest that polyamines could be effective agonists for the CaR, and several tissues, including the brain, may use the CaR as a target for the actions of spermine and other endogenous polycationic agonists.",

Ca2+-sensing receptors (CaSRs) modulate calcium and magnesium homeostasis and many (patho)physiological processes by responding to extracellular stimuli, including divalent cations and amino acids. We report the first crystal structure of the extracellular domain (ECD) of human CaSR bound with Mg2+ and a tryptophan derivative ligand at 2.1 Å. The structure reveals key determinants for cooperative activation by metal ions and aromatic amino acids. The unexpected tryptophan derivative was bound in the hinge region between two globular ECD subdomains, and represents a novel high-affinity co-agonist of CaSR. The dissection of structure-function relations by mutagenesis, biochemical, and functional studies provides insights into the molecular basis of human diseases arising from CaSR mutations. The data also provide a novel paradigm for understanding the mechanism of CaSR-mediated signaling that is likely shared by the other family C GPCR [G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein)–coupled receptor] members and can facilitate the development of novel CaSR-based therapeutics.",

Hemichannels are also present in the nonjunctional regions of individual cells and their activity is gated by several agents, including calcium. However, their physiological roles are unknown. Using techniques of atomic force microscopy (AFM), fluorescent dye uptake assay, and laser confocal immunofluorescence imaging, we have examined the extracellular calcium-dependent modulation of cell volume. In response to a change in the extracellular physiological calcium concentration (1.8 to ≤1.6 mM) in an otherwise isosmotic condition, real-time AFM imaging revealed a significant and reversible increase in the volume of cells expressing gap-junctional proteins (connexins). Volume change did not occur in cells that were not expressing connexins. However, after the transient or stable transfection of connexin43, volume change did occur. The volume increase was accompanied by cytochalasin D-sensitive higher cell stiffness, which helped maintain cell integrity. These cellular physical changes were prevented by gap-junctional blockers, oleamide and β-glycyrrhetinic acid, or were reversed by returning extracellular calcium to the normal level. We conclude that nongap-junctional hemichannels regulate cell volume in response to the change in extracellular physiological calcium in an otherwise isosmotic situation.",

Receptor signaling was studied by measuring intracellular free calcium in response to different concentrations of extracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](o)) in the presence or absence of NPS-2143.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll ADH patients had lowered serum calcium ranging from 1.7 to 2.0 mm and inadequate intact PTH and urinary calcium excretion. In vitro testing of CaSR mutations from these patients revealed exaggerated [Ca(2+)](o)-induced cytosolic Ca(2+) responses with EC(50) values for [Ca(2+)](o) ranging from 1.56 to 3.15 mM, which was lower than for the wild-type receptor (4.27 mM). The calcilytic NPS-2143 diminished the responsiveness to [Ca(2+)](o) in the CaSR mutants T151R, E767Q, G830S, and A844T. The mutant P221L, however, was only responsive when coexpressed with the wild-type CaSR.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCalcilytics might offer medical treatment for patients with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia caused by calcilytic-sensitive CaSR mutants.",

During the continuous membrane electrical activity, which characterized the first phase of glucose evoked biphasic response, the [Ca2+]o decreased. In the second phase, the [Ca2+]o displayed an oscillatory behavior concomitantly with the membrane potential.",

            "This new concept, which substitutes the idea of one receptor/one GPCR conformation/one-uniform activation of signaling pathway(s), greatly complicates the scenario of GPCRs signalling, but opens new perspectives in the design of smart and tissue-specific drugs that avoid off-target actions or on-target effects on multiple tissues [269].",

            "As for other GPCRs, CaR activity can be regulated via phosphorylation by different protein kinases, such as PKC [76], which plays a significant role in the negative regulation of the CaR’s activity and the generation of CaR-induced intracellular Ca2+ oscillations.",

These receptors are characterized by a long extracellular amino-terminal domain called a Venus flytrap module (VFTM) containing the ligand binding pocket. To elucidate the molecular determinants implicated in Ca2+ recognition by the CaSR VFTM, we developed a homology model of the human CaSR VFTM from the x-ray structure of the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1), and a phylogenetic analysis of 14 class III GPCR VFTMs. We identified critical amino acids delineating a Ca2+ binding pocket predicted to be adjacent to, but distinct from, a cavity reminiscent of the binding site described for amino acids in mGluRs, GABA-B receptor, and GPRC6a. Most interestingly, these Ca2+-contacting residues are well conserved within class III GPCR VFTMs. Our model was validated by mutational and functional analysis, including the characterization of activating and inactivating mutations affecting a single amino acid, Glu-297, located within the proposed Ca2+ binding pocket of the CaSR and associated with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, respectively, genetic diseases characterized by perturbations in Ca2+ homeostasis. Altogether, these data define a Ca2+ binding pocket within the CaSR VFTM that may be conserved in several other class III GPCRs, thereby providing a molecular basis for extracellular Ca2+ sensing by these receptors.",

A chimeric hCaR with the sequence from residues 540–601 replaced by the corresponding sequence from the Fugu CaR remained fully functional. Another chimeric hCaR with the same region of sequence replaced by the corresponding sequence from metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1) still was activated by extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+] o ), but its function was severely compromised. Chimeric receptors with the hCaR VFT and mGluR1 seven-transmembrane domain plus C-tail domain retained good response to [Ca2+] o whether the Cys-rich domain was from hCaR or from mGluR1. Mutant hCaR with the Cys-rich domain deleted failed to respond to [Ca2+] o , although it was expressed at the cell surface and capable of dimerization. Our results indicate that the hCaR Cys-rich domain plays a critical role in signal transmission from VFT to seven-transmembrane domain.

This paradox might be explained if the local [Ca2+] at the cell membrane is very different from that in the rest of the cell. Soluble Ca2+ indicators, which indicate spatially averaged cytoplasmic [Ca2+], cannot resolve these localized, near-membrane [Ca2+] signals. FFP18, the newest Ca2+ indicator designed to selectively monitor near-membrane [Ca2+], has a lower Ca2+ affinity and is more water soluble than previously used membrane-associating Ca2+ indicators. Images of the intracellular distribution of FFP18 show that >65% is located on or near the plasma membrane. [Ca2+] transients recorded using FFP18 during membrane depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx show that near-membrane [Ca2+] rises faster and reaches micromolar levels at early times when the cytoplasmic [Ca2+], recorded using fura-2, has risen to only a few hundred nanomolar. High-speed series of digital images of [Ca2+] show that near-membrane [Ca2+], reported by FFP18, rises within 20 msec, peaks at 50-100 msec, and then declines. [Ca2+] reported by fura-2 rose slowly and continuously throughout the time images were acquired. The existence of these large, rapid increases in [Ca2+] directly beneath the surface membrane may explain how numerous (Ca2+)-sensitive membrane processes are activated at times when bulk cytoplasmic [Ca2+] changes are too small to activate them.",

            "abstract": "The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that signals in response to extracellular calcium and regulates parathyroid hormone secretion. The CaR is also expressed on normal mammary epithelial cells (MMECs), where it has been shown to inhibit secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and participate in the regulation of calcium and bone metabolism during lactation. In contrast to normal breast cells, the CaR has been reported to stimulate PTHrP production by breast cancer cells. In this study, we confirmed that the CaR inhibits PTHrP production by MMECs but stimulates PTHrP production by Comma-D cells (immortalized murine mammary cells) and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. We found that changes in intracellular cAMP, but not phospholipase C or MAPK signaling, correlated with the opposing effects of the CaR on PTHrP production. Pharmacologic stimulation of cAMP accumulation increased PTHrP production by normal and transformed breast cells. Inhibition of protein kinase A activity mimicked the effects of CaR activation on inhibiting PTHrP secretion by MMECs and blocked the effects of the CaR on stimulating PTHrP production in Comma-D and MCF-7 cells. We found that the CaR coupled to Gαi in MMECs but coupled to Gαs in Comma-D and MCF-7 cells. Thus, the opposing effects of the CaR on PTHrP production are because of alternate G-protein coupling of the receptor in normal versus transformed breast cells. Because PTHrP contributes to hypercalcemia and bone metastases, switching of G-protein usage by the CaR may contribute to the pathogenesis of breast cancer.",

In the present study, we aimed at investigating the mechanism of allosteric modulation in CaSR by testing dimers carrying mutations in the allosteric site of one or both of the subunits. To ensure measurements on a well-defined dimer composition, we applied a trans-activation system in which only the specific heterodimer of two loss-of-function mutants responded to agonist. Although one of these mutants was potentiated by a positive allosteric modulator, we showed that receptor activity was further potentiated in a trans-activation heterodimer containing a single allosteric site, however only when the allosteric site was located in the subunit responsible for G protein coupling. On the contrary, preventing activation in both subunits was necessary for obtaining full inhibition by a negative allosteric modulator. These findings correlate with the proposed activation mechanism of the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), in which only a single transmembrane domain is activated at a time. CaSR and mGluRs belong to the class C G protein-coupled receptors, and our findings thus suggest that the activation mechanism is common to this subfamily.",

However, during Ca2+ signaling events, Ca2+ moves in and out of the cell, causing changes not only in intracellular Ca2+, but also in local extracellular Ca2+. The fact that numerous cell types possess an extracellular Ca2+ “sensor” raises the question of whether these dynamic changes in external [Ca2+] may serve some sort of messenger function. We found that in intact gastric mucosa, the changes in extracellular [Ca2+] secondary to carbachol-induced increases in intracellular [Ca2+] were sufficient and necessary to elicit alkaline secretion and pepsinogen secretion, independent of intracellular [Ca2+] changes. These findings suggest that extracellular Ca2+ can act as a “third messenger” via Ca2+ sensor(s) to regulate specific subsets of tissue function previously assumed to be under the direct control of intracellular Ca2+.",

Internal and external factors that further modify K+ channel function permit fine-tuning of neuronal circuits. Humanether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG) K+ channels are unusually sensitive to external calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o). Small changes in [Ca2+]o shift the voltage dependence of channel activation to more positive membrane potentials, an effect that cannot be explained by nonspecific surface charge screening or channel pore block. The HERG–calcium concentration–response relationship spans the physiological range for [Ca2+]o. The modulatory actions of calcium are attributable to differences in the Ca2+affinity between rested and activated channels. Adjacent extracellular, negatively charged amino acids (E518 and E519) near the S4 voltage sensor influence both channel gating and Ca2+dependence. Neutralization of these charges had distinct effects on channel gating and calcium sensitivity. A change in the degree of energetic coupling between these amino acids on transition from closed to activated channel states reveals movement in this region during channel gating and defines a molecular mechanism for protein state-dependent ligand interactions. The results suggest a novel extracellular [Ca2+]o sensing mechanism coupled to allosteric changes in channel gating and a mechanism for fine-tuning cell repolarization.",

            "abstract": "Background: Extracellular Ca2+ alters mGluR1α activity but by an unknown mechanism. Results: Mutations in predicted Ca2+-binding sites modulated the potency of both orthosteric and allosteric modulators. Conclusion: Ca2+ binding exerts multiple types of effects on mGluR1α. Significance: Improved knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the actions of Ca2+ on mGluR1α activity could facilitate development of isoform-selective drugs and/or suggest ways to tune the actions of available drugs. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1α (mGluR1α), a member of the family C G protein-coupled receptors, is emerging as a potential drug target for various disorders, including chronic neuronal degenerative diseases. In addition to being activated by glutamate, mGluR1α is also modulated by extracellular Ca2+. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Moreover, it has long been challenging to develop receptor-specific agonists due to homologies within the mGluR family, and the Ca2+-binding site(s) on mGluR1α may provide an opportunity for receptor-selective targeting by therapeutics. In the present study, we show that our previously predicted Ca2+-binding site in the hinge region of mGluR1α is adjacent to the site where orthosteric agonists and antagonists bind on the extracellular domain of the receptor. Moreover, we found that extracellular Ca2+ enhanced mGluR1α-mediated intracellular Ca2+ responses evoked by the orthosteric agonist l-quisqualate. Conversely, extracellular Ca2+ diminished the inhibitory effect of the mGluR1α orthosteric antagonist (S)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine. In addition, selective positive (Ro 67-4853) and negative (7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester) allosteric modulators of mGluR1α potentiated and inhibited responses to extracellular Ca2+, respectively, in a manner similar to their effects on the response of mGluR1α to glutamate. Mutations at residues predicted to be involved in Ca2+ binding, including E325I, had significant effects on the modulation of responses to the orthosteric agonist l-quisqualate and the allosteric modulator Ro 67-4853 by extracellular Ca2+. These studies reveal that binding of extracellular Ca2+ to the predicted Ca2+-binding site in the extracellular domain of mGluR1α modulates not only glutamate-evoked signaling but also the actions of both orthosteric ligands and allosteric modulators on mGluR1α.",

            "abstract": "Background. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) represents an adaptive response to progressively impaired control of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D in chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is characterized by parathyroid hyperplasia and excessive synthesis and secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Parathyroid hyperplasia in uremic rats can be prevented by calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) activation with the calcimimetic cinacalcet (Sensipar®/Mimpara®); however, it is unknown, how long the effects of cinacalcet persist after withdrawal of treatment or if cinacalcet is efficacious in uremic rats with established sHPT. Methods. We sought to determine the effect of cinacalcet discontinuation in uremic rats and whether cinacalcet was capable of influencing parathyroid hyperplasia in animals with established sHPT. Results. Discontinuation of cinacalcet resulted in reversal of the beneficial effects on serum PTH and parathyroid hyperplasia. In rats with established sHPT, cinacalcet decreased serum PTH and mediated regression of parathyroid hyperplasia. The cinacalcet-mediated decrease in parathyroid gland size was accompanied by increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Prevention of cellular proliferation with cinacalcet occurred despite increased serum phosphorus and decreased serum calcium. Conclusions. The animal data provided suggest established parathyroid hyperplasia can be reversed by modulating CaSR activity with cinacalcet and that continued treatment may be necessary to maintain reductions in PTH.",

            "abstract": "Calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), expressed in parathyroid gland and kidney, is a critical regulator of extracellular calcium homeostasis. This G protein-coupled receptor exists at the plasma membrane as a homodimer, although it is unclear at which point in the biosynthetic pathway dimerization occurs. To address this issue, we have analyzed wild-type and mutant CASRs harboring R66H, R66C or N583X-inactivating mutations identified in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia/neonatal severe hyperparathyroid patients, which were transiently expressed in kidney cells. All mutants were deficient in cell signaling responses to extracellular CASR ligands relative to wild-type. All mutants, although as well expressed as wild-type, lacked mature glycosylation, indicating impaired trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Dimerized forms of wild-type, R66H and R66C mutants were present, but not of the N583X mutant. By immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of non-permeabilized cells, although cell surface expression was observed for the wild-type, little or none was seen for the mutants. In permeabilized cells, perinuclear staining was observed for both wild-type and mutants. By colocalization fluorescence confocal microscopy, the mutant CASRs were localized within the ER but not within the Golgi apparatus. By the use of photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy, it was demonstrated that the wild-type, R66H and R66C mutants were dimerized in the ER, whereas the N583X mutant was not. Hence, constitutive CASR dimerization occurs in the ER and is likely to be necessary, but is not sufficient, for exit of the receptor from the ER and trafficking to the cell surface.",

Furthermore, autophagy associated with [Ca2+]i. Autophagy has previously been demonstrated to participate in the hypertrophic process. The current study investigated whether suppression of CaSR affects the hypertrophic response via modulating autophagy. Isoproterenol (ISO) was used to induce cardiac hypertrophy in Wistar rats. Hypertrophic status was determined by echocardiographic assessment, hematoxylin and eosin, and Masson's staining. The protein expression levels of CaSR and autophagy level were observed. Changes of hypertrophy and autophagy indicators were observed following intravenous injection of a CaSR inhibitor. An ISO-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy model was established and used determine the involvement of GdCl3. [Ca2+]i was determined using Fluo-4/AM dye followed by confocal microscopy. The expression levels of various active proteins were analyzed by western blotting. The size of the heart, expression levels of CaSR and autophagy level were markedly increased in hypertrophic myocardium. In addition, the present study demonstrated that the indicators of hypertrophy and autophagy were effectively suppressed by CaSR inhibitor. Furthermore, similar effects were demonstrated in neonatal rat hypertrophic cardiomyocytes treated with ISO. It was also observed that CaSR regulates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway induced by ISO in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the AMPK inhibition significantly reduced the autophagy level following CaSR stimulation (P<0.05). The results of the present demonstrated that inhibition of CaSR may ameliorate cardiac hypertrophy induced by ISO and the effect may be associated with the inhibition of autophagy and suppression of the CaMKKβ-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway.",

            "abstract": "In many cases, the biologic responses of cells to extracellular signals and the specificity of the responses cannot be explained solely on the basis of the interactions of known signaling proteins. Recently, scaffolding and adaptor proteins have been identified that organize signaling proteins in cells and that contribute to the nature and specificity of signaling pathways. In an effort to identify proteins that might organize the signaling system(s) activated by the extracellular Ca2+ receptor (CaR), we used a bait construct representing the intracellular C terminus of the human CaR and the yeast two hybrid system to screen a human kidney cDNA library. We identified a clone representing the C-terminal 1042 amino acids (aa) of the cytoskeletal protein filamin (ABP-280). Analysis of truncation and deletion constructs of the CaR C terminus and the filamin cDNA clone demonstrated that the CaR and filamin interact via regions containing aa 907–997 of the CaR C terminus and aa 1566–1875 of filamin. Interaction of the two proteins in mammalian HEK-293 cells was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization of them using immunofluorescence microscopy. The functional importance of their interaction was documented by transiently expressing the CaR in M2 melanoma cells that lack filamin, or in A7 melanoma cells that stably express filamin, and demonstrating that the CaR activated ERK only in the presence of filamin. Co-expression of the CaR with a peptide derived from the region of the CaR C terminus that interacts with filamin reduced the ability of the CaR to activate p42ERK in a dose-dependent manner, but did not inhibit the ability of the ETA receptor to activate ERK. The fact that filamin interacts with the CaR and other cell signaling proteins including mitogen-activated protein kinases and small GTPases, indicates that it may act as a scaffolding protein to organize cell signaling systems involving the CaR.",

Dysregulation of CaSR expression or mutations in the CASR gene cause disorders of Ca(2+) homeostasis and contribute to the progression or severity of cancers and cardiovascular disease. This brief review highlights recent findings that define the CaSR life cycle, which controls the cellular abundance of CaSR and CaSR signaling. A novel mechanism, termed agonist-driven insertional signaling (ADIS), contributes to the unique hallmarks of CaSR signaling, including the high degree of cooperativity and the lack of functional desensitization. Agonist-mediated activation of plasma membrane-localized CaSR increases the rate of insertion of CaSR at the plasma membrane without altering the constitutive endocytosis rate, thereby acutely increasing the maximum signaling response. Prolonged CaSR signaling requires a large intracellular ADIS-mobilizable pool of CaSR, which is maintained by signaling-mediated increases in biosynthesis. This model provides a rational framework for characterizing the defects caused by CaSR mutations and the altered functional expression of wild-type CaSR in disease states. Mechanistic dissection of ADIS of CaSR should lead to optimized pharmacological approaches to normalize CaSR signaling in disorders of Ca(2+) homeostasis.",

Real time measurements of net water flux in the lumen of single gastric glands of the intact amphibian stomach were performed using ion-selective double-barreled microelectrodes. Water movement was measured by recording changes in the concentration of impermeant TEA+ ions ([TEA+]gl) with TEA+-sensitive microelectrodes inserted in the lumen of individual gastric glands. Glandular K+ (K+gl) and H+ (pHgl) were also measured by using K+- and H+-sensitive microelectrodes, respectively. Stimulation with histamine significantly decreased [TEA]gl, indicating net water flow toward the gland lumen. This response was inhibited by the H+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, SCH 28080. Histamine also elicited a significant and reversible increase in [K+]gl that was blocked by chromanol 293B, a blocker of KCQN1 K+ channels. Histamine failed to induce net water flow in the presence of chromanol 293B. In the “resting state,” stimulation of CaR with diverse agonists resulted in significant increase in [TEA]gl. CaR activation also significantly reduced histamine-induced water secretion and apical K+ transport. Our data validate the strong link between histamine-stimulated acid secretion and water transport. We also show that cAMP-dependent [K+]gl elevation prior to the onset of acid secretion generates the osmotic gradient initially driving water into the gastric glands and that CaR activation inhibits this process, probably through reduction of intracellular cAMP levels.",

            "abstract": "The G protein-coupled, extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) regulates parathyroid hormone secretion and parathyroid cellular proliferation as well as the functions of diverse other cell types. The CaR resides in caveolae-plasma membrane microdomains containing receptors and associated signaling molecules that are thought to serve as cellular “message centers.” An additional mechanism for coordinating cellular signaling is the presence of scaffold proteins that bind and organize components of signal transduction cascades. With the use of the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified filamin-A (an actin-cross-linking, putative scaffold protein that binds mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) components activated by the CaR) as an intracellular binding partner of the CaR's carboxyl (COOH)-terminal tail. A direct interaction of the two proteins was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay. Moreover, confocal microscopy combined with two color immunofluorescence showed co-localization of the CaR and filamin-A within parathyroid cells as well as HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the CaR. Deletion mapping localized the sites of interaction between the two proteins to a stretch of 60 amino acid residues within the distal portion of the CaR's COOH-terminal tail and domains 14 and 15 in filamin-A, respectively. Finally, introducing the portion of filamin-A interacting with the CaR into CaR-transfected HEK-293 cells using protein transduction with a His-tagged, Tat-filamin-A fusion protein nearly abolished CaR-mediated activation of ERK1/2 MAPK but had no effect on ERK1/2 activity stimulated by ADP. Therefore, the binding of the CaR's COOH-terminal tail to filamin-A may contribute to its localization in caveolae, link it to the actin-based cytoskeleton, and participate in CaR-mediated activation of MAPK.",

            "abstract": "The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), a member of G protein-coupled receptor family C, regulates systemic calcium homeostasis by activating Gq- and Gi-linked signaling in the parathyroid, kidney, and intestine. CaR is ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase dorfin and degraded via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (Huang, Y., Niwa, J., Sobue, G., and Breitwieser, G. E. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 11610–11617). Here we provide evidence for a conformational or functional checkpoint in CaR biogenesis using two complementary approaches. First we characterized the sensitivity of loss- or gain-of-function CaR mutants to proteasome inhibition by MG132. The stabilization of loss-of-function mutants and insensitivity of gain-of-function mutants to MG132 suggests that receptor sensitivity to calcium influences susceptibility to proteasomal degradation. Second, we used the allosteric activator NPS R-568 and antagonist NPS 2143 to promote the active and inactive conformations of wild type CaR, respectively. Overnight culture in NPS R-568 increased expression of CaR, whereas NPS 2143 had the opposite effect. NPS R-568 and NPS 2143 differentially regulated maturation and cell surface expression of wild type CaR, directly affecting maximal signaling responses. NPS R-568 rescued expression of loss-of-function CaR mutants, increasing plasma membrane expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to 5 mm Ca2+. Disorders of calcium homeostasis caused by CaR mutations may therefore result from altered receptor biogenesis independent of receptor function, i.e. a protein folding disorder. The allosteric modulators NPS R-568 and NPS 2143 not only alter CaR sensitivity to calcium and hence signaling but also modulate receptor expression.",

The expression of Ca-SR has been identified in both nonexcitable and excitable cells, including neurons and smooth muscle cells. Whether Ca-SR was expressed and functioning in cardiac myocytes remained unclear. In the present study, the transcripts of Ca-SR were identified in rat heart tissues using RT-PCR that was further confirmed by sequence analysis. Ca-SR proteins were detected in rat ventricular and atrial tissues as well as in isolated cardiac myocytes. Anti-(Ca-SR) Ig did not detect any specific bands after preadsorption with standard Ca-SR antigens. An immunohistochemistry study revealed the presence of Ca-SR in rat cardiac as well as other tissues. An increase in extracellular calcium or gadolinium induced a concentration-dependent sustained increase in [Ca2+]i in isolated ventricular myocytes from adult rats. Spermine (1-10 mm) also increased [Ca2+]i. Pre-treatment of cardiac myocytes with thapsigargin or U73122 abolished the extracellular calcium, gadolinium or spermine-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. The blockade of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger or voltage-dependent calcium channels did not alter the extracellular calcium-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Finally, extracellular calcium, gadolinium and spermine all increased intracellular inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) levels. Our results demonstrated that Ca-SR was expressed in cardiac tissue and cardiomyocytes and its function was regulated by extracellular calcium and spermine.",

The extracellular domain of cadherins contains characteristic repeats that regulate homophilic and heterophilic interactions during adhesion and cell sorting. Although cadherins may have originated to facilitate mechanical cell-cell adhesion, they have evolved to function in many other aspects of morphogenesis. These additional roles rely on cadherin interactions with a wide range of binding partners that modify their expression and adhesion activity by local regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and diverse signaling pathways. Here we examine how different members of the cadherin family act in different developmental contexts, and discuss the mechanisms involved.",

            "abstract": "Compelling evidence of a cell surface receptor sensitive to extracellular calcium was observed as early as the 1980s and was finally realized in 1993 when the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) was cloned from bovine parathyroid tissue. Initial studies relating to the CaR focused on its key role in extracellular calcium homeostasis, but as the amount of information about the receptor grew it became evident that it was involved in many biological processes unrelated to calcium homeostasis. The CaR responds to a diverse array of stimuli extending well beyond that merely of calcium, and these stimuli can lead to the initiation of a wide variety of intracellular signaling pathways that in turn are able to regulate a diverse range of biological processes. It has been through the examination of the molecular characteristics of the CaR that we now have an understanding of how this single receptor is able to convert extracellular messages into specific cellular responses. Recent CaR-related reviews have focused on specific aspects of the receptor, generally in the context of the CaR's role in physiology and pathophysiology. This review will provide a comprehensive exploration of the different aspects of the receptor, including its structure, stimuli, signalling, interacting protein partners, and tissue expression patterns, and will relate their impact on the functionality of the CaR from a molecular perspective.",

            "abstract": "The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G protein-coupled receptor. The CaR stimulation elicits phospholipase C-mediated inositol triphosphate formation, leading to an elevation in the level of intracellular calcium released from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Depletion of ER Ca(2+) leads to ER stress, which is thought to induce apoptosis. Intracellular calcium overload-induced apoptosis in cardiac myocytes during hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/Re) has been demonstrated. However, the links between CaR, ER stress and apoptosis during H/Re are unclear. This study hypothesized that the CaR could induce apoptosis in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes during H/Re via the ER stress pathway. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were subjected to 3 hr of hypoxia, followed by 6 hr of reoxygenation. CaR expression was elevated and the number of apoptotic cells was significantly increased, as shown by transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling, with exposure to CaCl(2), a CaR activator, during H/Re. The intracellular calcium concentration was significantly elevated and the Ca(2+) concentration in the ER was dramatically decreased during H/Re with CaCl(2); both intracellular and ER calcium concentrations were detected by laser confocal microscopy. Expression of GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78), the cleavage products of ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6), phospho-PERK [pancreatic ER kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase], the activated fragments of caspase-12, and phospho-JNK (c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase) were increased following exposure to CaCl(2) during H/Re. Our results confirmed that the activated CaR can induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis via ER stress-associated apoptotic pathways during H/Re.",

However, all cells that express the CaR are not necessarily involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis. The recent localisation of CaR expression on a variety of cell types more usually associated with non-Ca(2+)-homeostatic endocrine function may have serious repercussions for the interpretation of data in those systems which routinely culture cells under standard hypercalcaemic conditions.

How the pancreas regulates the ionic composition and the level of Ca2+ saturation in an alkaline environment such as the pancreatic juice is not known. Because of the tight cause-effect relationship between Ca2+ concentration and lithogenicity, and because hypercalcemia is proposed as an etiologic factor for several pancreatic diseases, we have investigated whether pancreatic tissues express a Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) similar to that recently identified in parathyroid tissue. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate the presence of a CaR-like molecule in rat pancreatic acinar cells, pancreatic ducts, and islets of Langerhans. Functional studies, in which intracellular free Ca2+concentration was measured in isolated acinar cells and interlobular ducts, show that both cell types are responsive to the CaR agonist gadolinium (Gd3+) and to changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentration. We also assessed the effects of CaR stimulation on physiological HCO3 −secretion from ducts by making measurements of intracellular pH. Luminal Gd3+ is a potent stimulus for HCO3 − secretion, being equally as effective as raising intracellular cAMP with forskolin. These results suggest that the CaR in the exocrine pancreas monitors the Ca2+ concentration in the pancreatic juice, and might therefore be involved in regulating the level of Ca2+ in the lumen, both under basal conditions and during hormonal stimulation. The failure of this mechanism might lead to pancreatic stone formation and even to pancreatitis.",

            "abstract": "A hallmark of chronic kidney disease is hyperphosphatemia due to renal phosphate retention. Prolonged parathyroid gland exposure to hyperphosphatemia leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism characterized by hyperplasia of the glands and excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which causes renal osteodystrophy. PTH secretion from the parathyroid glands is controlled by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) that senses extracellular calcium. High extracellular calcium activates the CaSR causing inhibition of PTH secretion through multiple signaling pathways. Cinacalcet is the first drug targeting the CaSR and can be used to effectively control and reduce PTH secretion in PTH-related diseases. Cinacalcet is a positive allosteric modulator of the CaSR and affects PTH secretion from parathyroid glands by shifting the calcium-PTH concentration-response curve to the left. One major disadvantage of cinacalcet is its hypocalcemic side effect, which may be caused by increased CaSR-mediated calcitonin secretion from the thyroid gland. However, multiple studies indicate that PTH and calcitonin secretion are stimulated by different signaling pathways, and therefore it might be possible to develop a CaSR activating drug that selectively activates signaling pathways that inhibit PTH secretion while having no effect on signaling pathways involved in calcitonin secretion. Such a drug would have the same therapeutic value as cinacalcet in lowering PTH secretion while eliminating the side effect of hypocalcemia by virtue of it not affecting calcitonin secretion. The present review will focus on recent advancements in understanding signaling and biased signaling of the CaSR, and how that may be utilized to discover new and smarter drugs targeting the CaSR.",

Unlike Cao2+, which is an orthosteric agonist, L-amino acids and cinacalcet are positive allosteric modulators. CaSR expression levels vary considerably between tissues, but the physiological significance of these differences in expression for the effects of its activators is unknown. To investigate the impact of receptor expression on CaSR-mediated signaling we used a tetracycline-inducible expression system and focused on intracellular Ca2+ (Cai2+) responses in single cells and considered both population and single-cell behavior. Increased receptor expression positively modulated CaSR-mediated Cai2+ mobilization in response to elevated Cao2+, the amino acid L-phenylalanine, or the calcimimetic cinacalcet. It lowered threshold concentrations for the initiation of Cai2+ oscillations and for their transformation to sustained Cai2+ elevations, and it increased the proportions of responding cells. It also positively modulated the frequency of Cai2+ oscillations with the order of effectiveness: cinacalcet equal to or greater than Cao2+ greater than L-phenylalanine. The results indicate that receptor expression modulates key characteristics of the Cai2+ response at the single-cell level as well as the amplitude of whole-tissue CaSR-mediated responses by recruiting quiescent cells into the active pool of responding cells. By lowering the threshold concentrations for Cao2+- and L-amino acid-induced responses below the physiological levels of these nutrients in plasma, mechanisms that up-regulate receptor expression can control tissue function in the absence of dynamic changes in ligand concentration.",

Many clinically relevant CaSR mutations are located in the heptahelical membrane spanning and extracellular loop regions of the receptor, where allosteric modulators are predicted to bind. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of such mutations on the pharmacoregulation of the CaSR by the positive and negative allosteric modulators, cinacalcet and NPS-2143, respectively. Both cinacalcet and NPS-2143 effectively rescued mutants whose cell surface expression was substantially impaired, suggesting that both classes of drug can stabilize a receptor conformation that is trafficked more effectively to the cell surface. In addition, functional impairments in almost all mutant CaSRs were rescued by either cinacalcet or NPS-2143 via restoration of intracellular signaling. There was a significantly greater ability of both compounds to modulate agonist-stimulated intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization than ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that the allosteric modulators engender bias in agonist-stimulated CaSR signaling to different pathways. Three mutations (G(670)R, P(748)R, and L(773)R) altered the binding affinity of allosteric modulators to the CaSR, and 3 mutations (V(817)I, L(773)R, and E(767)K) altered the cooperativity between the allosteric modulator and Ca(2+)(o). These findings have important implications for the treatment of diseases associated with CaSR mutations using allosteric CaSR modulators and for analyzing the effects of mutations on the function and pharmacoregulation of the CaSR.",

After rest periods of 3 minutes or longer, 10% of total dye-accessible calcium (300-500 microM) is depleted cumulatively from the extracellular space by four to eight beats at 2 Hz stimulation. During continued stimulation, or during quiescence following a depletion response, mean extracellular calcium concentrations return toward the prestimulatory level in the course of 2-4 minutes. A single stimulation placed 2-30 seconds subsequent to rapid pacing results in a potentiated beat with an accompanying net increment of mean extracellular calcium. Total dye-accessible calcium can increase by at least 4% at such a beat, and depletion responses can be repeated immediately thereafter. During a sequence of such responses, extracellular calcium lost cumulatively during three to five rapid beats is replenished, for the most part, by a single post-stimulatory beat. These results demonstrate that most of the \"activator pool\" of cellular calcium can turn over to the extracellular space during a single contraction cycle in rabbit myocardium, and suggest that, in mammalian myocardium, diastolic calcium efflux may be quantitatively negligible in relation to efflux during excitation-contraction coupling.",

We demonstrate that A beta(s) produce a CaR-mediated activation of a Ca(2+)-permeable, nonselective cation channel (NCC), probably via elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ (Cai), in cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons from normal rats and from wild type mice but not those from mice with targeted disruption of the CaR gene (CaR -/-). A beta(s) also activate NCC in CaR-transfected but not in nontransfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells.

Glu or Asp applications produced dose-dependent decreases in [Ca2+]o from a base line of 1.25 mM to as low as 0.08 mM and increases in [K+]o from 2.8 mM to as high as 13.3 mM. These ionic changes were accompanied by negative DC potential shifts of up to 15 mV. [K+]o changes were practically constant in all cortical layers, whereas [Ca2+]o changes were variable with depth, showing two localized marked maximums. One was observed in the superficial layers, 150-300 microns below cortical surface and the second at 1,100-1,300 microns, in a region corresponding roughly to layer V. Application of tetrodotoxin (TTX) onto the cortical surface abolished stimulus-evoked ionic changes, whereas amino acid-induced [Ca2+]o changes remained practically unaltered, and [K+]o changes were reduced by 20% on average. Selective degeneration of the pyramidal tract neurons was induced by performing chronic lesions of the pyramidal tract at the bulbar level. In these conditions, laminar profiles of amino acid-induced [Ca2+]o changes were considerably altered in the corresponding motor cortex. The maximum Ca2+ changes were then reduced by two-thirds, and the [Ca2+]o signals were practically constant throughout the cortex. Local cobalt (Co2+) or manganese (Mn2+) applications could abolish amino acid-evoked [Ca2+]o changes, whereas most of the [K+]o changes persisted. gamma-Aminobutyric acid applications could decrease [Ca2+]o signals to a large extent, whereas [K+]o changes were diminished by only 15-25% on average. These results show that the putative neurotransmitters Glu and Asp induce significant changes in [Ca2+]o and [K+]o in the rat cerebral cortex and indicate the possible origin of the ion fluxes in terms of neuronal elements and ionic channels: in particular, they indicate that the major part of the amino acid-induced [Ca2+]o maximum decreases can be ascribed to Ca2+ movements through channels located very likely on the pyramidal tract neurons in the motor cortex. They also indicate that significant reductions of the extracellular space volume occur during excitatory amino acid applications.",

            "abstract": "Homomeric acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) can be activated by extracellular H+ in the physiological pH range and may, therefore, contribute to neurotransmission and peripheral pain perception. ASIC1a and ASIC1b are alternative splice products of the ASIC1 gene. Here we show that both splice variants show steady-state inactivation when exposed to slightly decreased pH, limiting their operational range. Compared with ASIC1a, steady-state inactivation and pH activation of ASIC1b are shifted to more acidic values by 0.25 and 0.7 pH units, respectively, extending the dynamic range of ASIC1. Shifts of inactivation and activation are intimately linked; only two amino acids in the ectodomain, which are exchanged by alternative splicing, control both properties. Moreover, we show that extracellular, divalent cations like Ca2+ and Mg2+ as well as the polyvalent cation spermine shift the steady-state inactivation of ASIC1a and ASIC1b to more acidic values. This leads to a potentiation of the channel response and is due to a stabilization of the resting state. Our results indicate that ASIC1b is an effective sensor of transient H+ signals during slight acidosis and that, in addition to alternative splicing, interaction with di- and polyvalent cations extends the dynamic range of ASIC H+ sensors.",

            "abstract": "The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is activated by small changes in the ionic extracellular calcium concentration (Cao) within the physiological range, allowing the parathyroid gland to regulate serum Cao; however, the CaR is also distributed in a number of other tissues where it may sense other endogenous agonists and modulators. CaR agonists are polycationic molecules, and our previous studies suggest that charged residues in the extracellular domain of the CaR are critical for receptor activation through electrostatic interactions. Therefore, pH could also potentially modulate CaR activation by its polycationic agonists. Changes in the concentration of extracellular H+ substantially altered the activation of the CaR by Cao and other CaR agonists. The effects of external pH on the CaR's sensitivity to its agonists were observed for both acidic and basic deviations from physiological pH of 7.4, with increases in pH rendering the receptor more sensitive to activation by Cao and decreases in pH producing the converse effect. At pH values more acidic than 5.5, CaR sensitivity to its agonists showed some recovery. Changes in the intracellular pH could not account for the effects of external pH on CaR sensitivity to its agonists. Other G-protein-coupled receptors, which are endogenously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, showed little change in activity with alterations in external pH or effects opposite those found for the CaR. Extracellular pH directly alters the CaR in the case of Cao and Mgo activation; however, the charges on many organic and inorganic agonists are pH-dependent. Activating CaR mutations show reduced pHo modulation, suggesting a molecular mechanism for increased CaR activity at physiological pHo. Several CaR-expressing tissues, including regions of the stomach, the kidney, bone, and the brain, could potentially use the CaR as a sensor for pH and acid-base status.",

It is a member of the largest family of cell surface receptors, the G protein-coupled receptors, and it has been shown to be involved in Ca(2+)(o) homeostasis. Apart from its primary role in Ca(2+)(o) homeostasis, the CaR may be involved in phenomena that allow for the development of many types of benign or malignant tumors, from parathyroid adenomas to breast, prostate, and colon cancers. For example, whereas the CaR is expressed in both normal and malignant breast tissue, increased CaR levels have been reported in highly metastatic primary breast cancer cells and breast cancer cell lines, possibly contributing to their malignancy and associated alterations in their biological properties. In these settings the CaR exhibits oncogenic properties. Enhanced CaR expression and altered proliferation of prostate cancer cells in response to increased Ca(2+)(o) have also been described. In contrast, colon and parathyroid cancers often present with reduced or absent CaR expression, and activation of this receptor decreases cell proliferation, suggesting a role for the CaR as a tumor suppressor gene. Thus, the CaR may play an important role in the development of many types of neoplasia. Herein, we review the role of the CaR in various benign and malignant tumors in further detail, describing its contribution to parathyroid tumors, breast, prostate, and colon cancers, and we evaluate how pharmacological manipulations of this receptor may be of interest for the treatment of certain cancers in the future.",

Recently, there has been a focus on the use of allosteric modulators to restore the functional activity of mutant CASRs. In this study, the effect of allosteric modulators NPS R-568 and NPS 2143 on CASR mutants was studied in vitro.\n\n\nMETHODS\nDNA sequence analysis of the CASR gene was undertaken in autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia Japanese patients, and the functional consequences for the Gi-MAPK pathway and cell surface expression of CASR were determined. Furthermore, we studied the effect of NPS R-568 and NPS 2143 on the signal transduction activity and cell surface expression of each mutant CASR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 3 activating mutations (S122C, P569H, and I839T) and 2 inactivating mutations (A110T and R172G) in patients. The activating and inactivating mutations caused leftward and rightward shifts, respectively, in the dose-response curves of the signaling pathway. NPS R-568 rescued the signal transduction capacity of 2 inactivating mutants without increasing cell surface expression levels. NPS 2143 suppressed the enhanced activity of the activating mutants without altering cell surface expression levels, although A843E, which is a constitutively active mutant, was suppressed to a lesser degree.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have identified 4 novel mutations of CASR. Moreover, our results indicate that allosteric modulators can restore the activity of the loss- and gain-of-function mutant CASRs, identified in this study.",

The expression of CaR has been confirmed in various cell types, including cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, neurons and vascular endothelial cells. However, whether CaR is expressed and functions in cardiac fibroblasts has remained unknown. The present study investigated whether CaR played a role in cardiac fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion, both in cultured rat neonatal cardiac fibroblasts and in a model of cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol (ISO). Methods and Results: Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed the presence of CaR in cardiac fibroblasts. Calcium and calindol, a specific activator of CaR, elevated the intracellular calcium concentration in cardiac fibroblasts. Pretreatment of cardiac fibroblasts with calhex231, a specific inhibitor of CaR, U73122 and 2-APB attenuated the calindol- and extracellular calcium-induced increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). Cardiac fibroblast proliferation and migration were assessed by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), cell count and the cell scratch assay. ECM production was detected by expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 and -9 (MMP-3 and -9). Activation of CaR promoted cardiac fibroblast proliferation and migration and ECM secretion. More importantly, calhex231, suppressed cardiac fibroblast proliferation and migration and MMP-3 and -9 expression. To further investigate the effect of CaR on cardiac fibrosis, a model of ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy was established. Pretreatment with calhex231 prevented cardiac fibrosis and decreased the expression of MMP-3 and -9 expression. Conclusions: Our results are the first report that CaR plays an important role in Ca2+ signaling involved in cardiac fibrosis through the phospholipase C- inositol 3,4,5 phosphate (PLC-IP3) pathway.",

Estimates of the worldwide production of whey indicate that about 700,000 tonnes of true whey proteins are available as valuable food ingredients. Nutritional and functional characteristics of whey proteins are related to the structure and biological functions of these proteins. During recent decades, interest has grown in the nutritional efficacy of whey proteins in infant formula and in dietetic and health foods, using either native or predigested proteins. This paper focuses attention on the differences and similarities in composition of human and bovine milks with reference to infant formula. More desirable milk protein composition for consumption by humans is obtained by the addition of lactoferrin and more specific fractionations of proteins from bovine milk. Optimization of heating processes is important to minimize the destruction of milk components during fractionation and preservation processes. Some functional characteristics of whey proteins are discussed in relation to their properties for application in food products. Information obtained from functional characterization tests in model systems is more suitable to explain retroactively protein behavior in complex food systems than to predict functionality.",

In the early 2000s, research into taste reception was greatly developed with discovery of the receptors. However, the mechanism of salt taste reception is not fully elucidated yet and many questions still remain. At present, next-generation sequencing and genome-editing technologies are available which would become pivotal tools to elucidate the remaining issues. Here we review current mechanisms of salt taste reception in particular and characterize the properties of transmembrane channel-like 4 as a novel salt taste-related molecule that we found using these sophisticated tools.",

In addition to providing an apical entry pathway for transepithelial Na(+) reabsorption in tight epithelia such as the kidney distal tubule and collecting duct, ENaCs are also expressed in nonepithelial cells, where they may play different functional roles. The δ-subunit of ENaC was originally identified in humans and is able to form amiloride-sensitive Na(+) channels alone or in combination with β and γ, generally resembling the canonical kidney ENaC formed by α, β, and γ. However, δ differs from α in its tissue distribution and channel properties. Despite the low sequence conservation between α and δ (37% identity), their similar functional characteristics provide an excellent model for exploring structural correlates of specific ENaC biophysical and pharmacological properties. Moreover, the study of cellular mechanisms modulating the activity of different ENaC subunit combinations provides an opportunity to gain insight into the regulation of the channel. In this review, we examine the evolution of ENaC genes, channel subunit composition, the distinct functional and pharmacological features that δ confers to ENaC, and how this can be exploited to better understand this ion channel. Finally, we briefly consider possible functional roles of the ENaC δ-subunit.",

            "abstract": "In the tongue, distinct classes of taste receptor cells detect the five basic tastes; sweet, sour, bitter, sodium salt and umami. Among these qualities, bitter and sour stimuli are innately aversive, whereas sweet and umami are appetitive and generally attractive to animals. By contrast, salty taste is unique in that increasing salt concentration fundamentally transforms an innately appetitive stimulus into a powerfully aversive one. This appetitive–aversive balance helps to maintain appropriate salt consumption, and represents an important part of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. We have shown previously that the appetitive responses to NaCl are mediated by taste receptor cells expressing the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, but the cellular substrate for salt aversion was unknown. Here we examine the cellular and molecular basis for the rejection of high concentrations of salts. We show that high salt recruits the two primary aversive taste pathways by activating the sour- and bitter-taste-sensing cells. We also demonstrate that genetic silencing of these pathways abolishes behavioural aversion to concentrated salt, without impairing salt attraction. Notably, mice devoid of salt-aversion pathways show unimpeded, continuous attraction even to very high concentrations of NaCl. We propose that the ‘co-opting’ of sour and bitter neural pathways evolved as a means to ensure that high levels of salt reliably trigger robust behavioural rejection, thus preventing its potentially detrimental effects on health.",

Amiloride, caffeine and NaCl in H2O were also presented. It was found that NaCl-amiloride mixtures were most frequently described as salty, with the incidence of salty descriptions directly associated with NaCl concentration but not significantly associated with the presence or concentration of amiloride. Amiloride in H2O was called 'bitter', and the incidence of bitter descriptions was significantly associated with the presence of amiloride. The perceived temporal patterns varied with NaCl concentration but did not change with the presence of amiloride, except for an increase in perceived duration. No evidence was found for a dependence upon specific amiloride-sensitive mechanisms of human description of NaCl as salty or of gustatory temporal patterns evoked by NaCl.",

Here we show that ANO and TMC proteins share high sequence similarity and probably the same membrane topology, indicating that these proteins are evolutionarily related. We found many conserved amino acid residues between the two families of proteins, especially in regions spanning the transmembrane domains TM1, TM4-TM5, and TM6-TM7. These findings imply that these proteins form one large family, which we term ANO/TMC superfamily and that TMC proteins also function as channels for Cl- or other ions. The ANO/TMC superfamily proteins are present in almost all diverse groups of eukaryotic organisms, suggesting that the proteins function in important biological processes, such as ion homeostasis, in eukaryotic cells.",

The cellular mechanisms that mediate this phenomenon are not known. This \"anion paradox\" has been resolved by considering the field potential that is generated by restricted electrodiffusion of the anion through paracellular shunts between taste-bud cells. Neural responses to sodium chloride, sodium acetate, and sodium gluconate were studied while the field potential was voltage-clamped. Clamping at electronegative values eliminated the anion effect, whereas clamping at electropositive potentials exaggerated it. Thus, field potentials across the lingual epithelium modulate taste reception, indicating that the functional unit of taste reception includes the taste cell and its paracellular microenvironment.",

Whereas CALHM1 regulates mouse cortical neuron excitability, its roles in regulating type II cell excitability are unknown. In this study, we compared membrane conductances and action potentials in single identified TRPM5-GFP-expressing circumvallate papillae type II cells acutely isolated from wild-type (WT) and Calhm1 knockout (KO) mice. The activation kinetics of large voltage-gated outward currents were accelerated in cells from Calhm1 KO mice, and their associated nonselective tail currents, previously shown to be highly correlated with ATP release, were completely absent in Calhm1 KO cells, suggesting that CALHM1 contributes to all of these currents. Calhm1 deletion did not significantly alter resting membrane potential or input resistance, the amplitudes and kinetics of Na+ currents either estimated from action potentials or recorded from steady-state voltage pulses, or action potential threshold, overshoot peak, afterhyperpolarization, and firing frequency. However, Calhm1 deletion reduced the half-widths of action potentials and accelerated the deactivation kinetics of transient outward currents, suggesting that the CALHM1-associated conductance becomes activated during the repolarization phase of action potentials.NEW & NOTEWORTHY CALHM1 is an essential ion channel component of the ATP neurotransmitter release mechanism in type II taste bud cells. Its contribution to type II cell resting membrane properties and excitability is unknown. Nonselective voltage-gated currents, previously associated with ATP release, were absent in cells lacking CALHM1. Calhm1 deletion was without effects on resting membrane properties or voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels but contributed modestly to the kinetics of action potentials.",

This review focuses on new knowledge from these molecular approaches and attempts to place this in the context of previous questions and findings in the field. The individual taste cells within a taste bud are molecularly specialized for detection of one of the primary taste qualities: salt, sour, sweet, umami, and bitter. Transduction and transmitter release mechanisms differ substantially for taste cells transducing sour (Type III cells) compared with those transducing the qualities of sweet, umami, or bitter (Type II cells), although ultimately all transmission of taste relies on activation of purinergic P2X receptors on the afferent nerves. The ganglion cells providing innervation to the taste buds also appear divisible into functional and molecular subtypes, and each ganglion cell is primarily but not exclusively responsive to one taste quality.",

The presence of an epithelial cation channel that receives Na+ has previously been reported. However, no molecular entity involving Cl− receptors has been elucidated. We report the strong expression of transmembrane channel-like 4 (TMC4) in the circumvallate and foliate papillae projected to the glossopharyngeal nerve, mediating a high-concentration of NaCl. Electrophysiological analysis using HEK293T cells revealed that TMC4 was a voltage-dependent Cl− channel and the consequent currents were completely inhibited by NPPB, an anion channel blocker. TMC4 allowed permeation of organic anions including gluconate, but their current amplitudes at positive potentials were less than that of Cl−. Tmc4-deficient mice showed significantly weaker glossopharyngeal nerve response to high-concentration of NaCl than the wild-type littermates. These results indicated that TMC4 is a novel chloride channel that responds to high-concentration of NaCl.",

The antioxidant activity of these compounds has been examined by testing their peroxyl radical-trapping ability at physiological concentrations. Carnosine, homocarnosine, anserine, and other histidine derivatives all showed antioxidant activity. All of these compounds showing peroxyl radical-trapping activity were also electrochemically active as reducing agents in cyclic voltammetric measurements. Furthermore, carnosine inhibited the oxidative hydroxylation of deoxyguanosine induced by ascorbic acid and copper ions. Other roles of carnosine, such as chelation of metal ions, quenching of singlet oxygen, and binding of hydroperoxides, are also discussed. The data suggest a role for these histidine-related compounds as endogenous antioxidants in brain and muscle.",

Buffering capacities of inorganic phosphate, carnosine, and anserine in the pH range of 6.5-7.5 were high and relatively insensitive to changes in temperature within the range from 5 to 40°C. Histidine and balenine, however, represented rather low buffering capacities and large decreases in the capacity with increasing temperature. Several other non-physiological histidine containing dipeptides such as L-alanyl-L-histidine and L-seryl-L-histidine also showed high capacities and no temperature dependence. White muscle of skipjack tuna containing large amounts of histidine and anserine showed the highest muscle buffering capacity, followed by little-piked whale muscle containing high balenine. The buffering of these muscles represented a rather large temperature dependence above 20°C. Buffering capacities of several other fish muscles containing little amounts of histidine related dipeptides were low and showed almost no temperature dependence.",

            "abstract": "Goldfish reproduction is coordinated by pheromones that are released by ovulating females and detected by males. Two highly potent pheromones, a dihydroxyprogesterone and a prostaglandin, previously have been identified, and their effects on goldfish behavior have been studied in depth. We have cloned goldfish olfactory epithelium cDNAs belonging to two multigene G-protein coupled receptor families as a step toward elucidating the molecular basis of pheromone recognition. One gene family (GFA) consists of homologs of putative odorant receptors (approximately 320 residues) found in the olfactory epithelium of other fish and mammals. The other family (GFB) consists of homologs of putative pheromone receptors found in the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of mammals and also in the nose of pufferfish. GFB receptors (approximately 840 residues) are akin to the V2R family of VNO receptors, which possess a large extracellular N-terminal domain and are homologs of calcium-sensing and metabotropic glutamate receptors. In situ hybridization showed that the two families of goldfish receptors are differentially expressed in the olfactory epithelium. GFB mRNA is abundant in rather compact cells whose nuclei are near the apical surface. In contrast, GFA mRNA is found in elongated cells whose nuclei are positioned deeper in the epithelium. Our findings support the hypothesis that the separate olfactory organ and VNO of terrestrial vertebrates arose in evolution by the segregation of distinct classes of neurons that were differentially positioned in the olfactory epithelium of a precursor aquatic vertebrate.",

In the embryonic epidermis, Wg protein is secreted and taken up by neighboring cells, in which it is required for maintenance of engrailed transcription and accumulation of Armadillo protein. The dishevelled (dsh) gene mediates these signaling events as well as wg-dependent induction across tissue layers in the embryonic midgut. dsh is also required for the development processes in which wg functions in adult development. Overall, cells lacking dsh are unable to adopt fates specified by Wg. dsh functions cell autonomously, indicating that it is involved in the response of target cells to the Wg signal. dsh is expressed uniformly in the embryo and encodes a novel protein with no known catalytic motifs, although it shares a domain of homology with several junction-associated proteins. Our results demonstrate that dsh encodes a specific component of Wg signaling and illustrate that Wnt proteins may utilize a novel mechanism of extracellular signal transduction.",

            "abstract": "The rate of salt release in-mouth from salted potato crisps was evaluated. It was hypothesised that a slow steady release of sodium would occur on chewing and hydration; to test this a crisp was chewed and held in the oral cavity without swallowing for 60 s. Sodium release was measured over the entire holding period, after 20-30 s a peak in salivary sodium levels was recorded. A similar trend was observed with sensory perceived saltiness by trained panellists. The results suggest that a significant proportion of the crisp's salt flavouring is released in a pulse-type mechanism which would not be encountered when the crisp is exposed to normal eating patterns and would result in the consumption of a large proportion of unperceived sodium.",

In turn, ATP activates adjacent presynaptic (type III) cells to release serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE). The roles of these neurotransmitters in taste buds have not been fully elucidated. Here we tested whether ATP or 5-HT exert feedback onto receptor (type II) cells during taste stimulation. Our previous studies showed NE does not appear to act on adjacent taste bud cells, or at least on receptor cells. Our data show that 5-HT released from presynaptic (type III) cells provides negative paracrine feedback onto receptor cells by activating 5-HT1A receptors, inhibiting taste-evoked Ca2+ mobilization in receptor cells, and reducing ATP secretion. The findings also demonstrate that ATP exerts positive autocrine feedback onto receptor (type II) cells by activating P2Y1 receptors and enhancing ATP secretion. These results begin to sort out how purinergic and aminergic transmitters function within the taste bud to modulate gustatory signaling in these peripheral sensory organs.",

            "abstract": "The neocortical GABAergic network consists of diverse interneuron cell types that display distinct physiological properties and target their innervations to subcellular compartments of principal neurons. Inhibition directed toward the soma and proximal dendrites is crucial in regulating the output of pyramidal neurons, but the development of perisomatic innervation is poorly understood because of the lack of specific synaptic markers. In the primary visual cortex, for example, it is unknown whether, and to what extent, the formation and maturation of perisomatic synapses are intrinsic to cortical circuits or are regulated by sensory experience. Using bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice that label a defined class of perisomatic synapses with green fluorescent protein, here we show that perisomatic innervation developed during a protracted postnatal period after eye opening. Maturation of perisomatic innervation was significantly retarded by visual deprivation during the third, but not the fifth, postnatal week, implicating an important role for sensory input. To examine the role of cortical intrinsic mechanisms, we developed a method to visualize perisomatic synapses from single basket interneurons in cortical organotypic cultures. Characteristic perisomatic synapses formed through a stereotyped process, involving the extension of distinct terminal branches and proliferation of perisomatic boutons. Neuronal spiking in organotypic cultures was necessary for the proliferation of boutons and the extension, but not the maintenance, of terminal branches. Together, our results suggest that although the formation of perisomatic synapses is intrinsic to the cortex, visual experience can influence the maturation and pattern of perisomatic innervation during a postnatal critical period by modulating the level of neural activity within cortical circuits.",

            "abstract": "Pairs of taste cells were impaled with intracellular recording microelectrodes in intact taste buds in slices of Necturus lingual epithelium. Applying short pulses of 140 mM KCl or 200 mM CaCl2 solutions to the apical pore elicited receptor potentials in taste receptor cells. Chemostimulation of receptor cells elicited postsynaptic responses in basal cells in the taste bud. Postsynaptic responses in basal cells had a threshold for activation and did not saturate with increasing doses of chemical stimulus applied to the receptor cells. We directly depolarized individual receptor cells and tested whether this would evoke postsynaptic responses in basal cells. Depolarizing receptor cells to approximately 0 mV evoked small depolarizing responses in basal cells in 16% of the experiments. The properties of these responses were consistent with their being mediated by a chemical synapse. A comparison of the responses in basal cells evoked by depolarizing single receptor cells, with responses evoked by stimulating the entire receptor cell population with KCl suggests that there is extensive synaptic convergence from receptor cells onto each basal cell. We also tested whether electrical excitation of basal cells would elicit (retrograde) synaptic responses in receptor cells. Single depolarizing pulses (up to 1 sec duration) applied to basal cells through the intracellular recording microelectrode never evoked synaptic responses in receptor cells. However, when repetitive electrical stimuli were applied to basal cells (four to six 1 sec depolarizations to approximately 0 mV every 12 sec) we observed prolonged effects on receptor cells in 11 of 23 experiments. These effects included an increase in the amplitude of receptor potentials elicited by KCI (mean +/- SD = +19 +/- 5%), an increase in membrane input resistance of receptor cells (+27 +/- 11%), and a hyperpolarization of receptor cells (3–10 mV). In control experiments, repetitive stimulation of one receptor cell never elicited such effects in another receptor cell. We investigated the possibility that serotonin (5-HT), released from basal cells, mediated the above modulatory effects on receptor cells. Bath-applied 5-HT (100 microM) mimicked the effects produced by repetitive basal cell stimulation (KCI responses increased by 23 +/- 12%; input resistance increased by 24 +/- 11%; hyperpolarization of 5–15 mV; N = 14). We conclude that basal cells release 5-HT onto adjacent taste receptor cells and that this enhances the electrotonic propagation of receptor potentials from the apical (chemosensitive) tip to the basal (synaptic) processes of receptor cells. The net effect is that activation of basal cells effectively increases the chemosensitivity of taste receptor cells.",

The efficiency of mucus clearance in the airways, the cascade leading to tissue injury, and inflammation are modulated by autocrine/paracrine release of nucleotides and signaling by purinergic receptors. We assessed the role of purinergic receptors in innate host defense of the lung in vivo by infecting mice deficient in P2Y1, P2Y2, or both receptors with intratracheal instillation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After P. aeruginosa challenge, all double knockout (P2Y1/P2Y2-/-) mice succumbed within 30 h of challenge, whereas 85% of the wild-type mice survived. Thirty-three percent of wild-type mice survived beyond 96 h. Single knockout mice, P2Y1-/-, or P2Y2-/-, exhibited intermediate survivals. Twenty-four hours following intratracheal instillation of a sublethal dose of P. aeruginosa, the level of total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was 1.8-fold higher in double knockout than in wild-type mice (P < 0.04). Total cell count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids at 4 h and levels of IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 in lung homogenates at 24 h postchallenge were significantly reduced in P2Y1/P2Y2-/- mice relative to wild-type mice. These findings suggest that purinergic receptors exert a protective role against infection of the lungs by P. aeruginosa by decreasing protein leak and enhancing proinflammatory cytokine response.",

        "abstract": "The cloning of a G protein-coupled extracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(o)(2+))-sensing receptor (CaR) has elucidated the molecular basis for many of the previously recognized effects of Ca(o)(2+) on tissues that maintain systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, especially parathyroid chief cells and several cells in the kidney. The availability of the cloned CaR enabled the development of DNA and antibody probes for identifying the CaR's mRNA and protein, respectively, within these and other tissues. It also permitted the identification of human diseases resulting from inactivating or activating mutations of the CaR gene and the subsequent generation of mice with targeted disruption of the CaR gene. The characteristic alterations in parathyroid and renal function in these patients and in the mice with \"knockout\" of the CaR gene have provided valuable information on the CaR's physiological roles in these tissues participating in mineral ion homeostasis. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about how the CaR regulates other tissues involved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, particularly bone and intestine. Moreover, there is evidence that additional Ca(o)(2+) sensors may exist in bone cells that mediate some or even all of the known effects of Ca(o)(2+) on these cells. Even more remains to be learned about the CaR's function in the rapidly growing list of cells that express it but are uninvolved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) metabolism. Available data suggest that the receptor serves numerous roles outside of systemic mineral ion homeostasis, ranging from the regulation of hormonal secretion and the activities of various ion channels to the longer term control of gene expression, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and cellular proliferation. In some cases, the CaR on these \"nonhomeostatic\" cells responds to local changes in Ca(o)(2+) taking place within compartments of the extracellular fluid (ECF) that communicate with the outside environment (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract). In others, localized changes in Ca(o)(2+) within the ECF can originate from several mechanisms, including fluxes of calcium ions into or out of cellular or extracellular stores or across epithelium that absorb or secrete Ca(2+). In any event, the CaR and other receptors/sensors for Ca(o)(2+) and probably for other extracellular ions represent versatile regulators of numerous cellular functions and may serve as important therapeutic targets.",

These electrodes had tip diameters of 4-12 microns, electrical time constants of 2-5 ms, and electrochemical time constants of less than 30 ms. During individual beats a transient depletion of extracellular Ca (CaO) was recorded. This decrease of [Ca]O begins very early during the action potential, before significant tension development, and reaches a maximum much before the peak of developed tension (T). The depletion of CaO is blocked by CoCl2 or verapamil and enhanced by 10(-8) M isoproterenol or reduction of extracellular Na concentration to 35 mM. The magnitude of this early depletion of CaO increases in parallel with tension as a function of [Ca]O (8.46 +/- 0.98 microM at 0.2 mM CaO, 16.9 +/- 1.6 microM at 0.5 mM CaO, and 44.7 +/- 3.7 microM at 2.0 mM CaO). However the magnitude (in mV) of the recorded signal decreases with increasing [Ca]O and T, suggestive of saturation. The magnitude of this early transient CaO depletion also increases in parallel with the increase of T produced by initiating stimulation from rest (except for the first beat, which may be more dependent on stored Ca). It is probable that the depletions recorded represent Ca influx into cardiac cells from the extracellular space. The magnitude of Ca influx represented by the CaO depletions is difficult to quantitate but may be roughly in the range of Ca entry that would be required for direct activation of the myofilaments.",

In turn, ERKs phosphorylate and regulate key intracellular enzymes and transcription factors involved in the control of cellular proliferation. The tyrosine-kinase class of growth-factor receptors transmits signals to ERKs in a multistep process that involves Ras and a limited number of defined molecules. In contrast, ERK activation by G-protein-coupled receptors is poorly understood, as is the role of ras in this signalling pathway. We have explored in COS-7 cells the mechanism of ERKs activation by m1 and m2 muscarinic receptors, typical examples of receptors coupled through Gq proteins to induce phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and to G(i) proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, respectively. Here we present evidence that ERK activation is mediated by beta gamma subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins acting on a ras-dependent pathway.",

            "abstract": "Editorial In this issue of The Journal Moestrup et al. (1) report that polybasic drugs such as aprotinin, aminoglycosides, and poly-myxin B are taken up by the endocytic receptor, megalin/gp330. Antibiotics such as gentamycin and polymyxin B are well known to be both nephrotoxic and ototoxic, but the mechanisms by which these drugs become concentrated in lysosomes of the kidney and ear to produce tissue damage remain unknown. This carefully executed study demonstrates that they bind to mega-lin/gp330 both in vitro and in vivo and are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis in clathrin-coated pits. Thus, Moestrup et al. (1) provide a clear explanation of the molecular mechanisms by which the kidney and probably also the ear take up and concentrate these toxic, polybasic drugs. At the same time the authors have added another dimension, a pathologic dimension, to the story of megalin (gp330) by showing that it serves as a drug receptor. What is megalin/gp330? gp330 (megalin) is one of the most abundant membrane proteins in the renal proximal tubule. It was originally identified as the target antigen of Heymann nephritis, a rat model of membranous glomerulonephritis (2, 3). Its location in clathrin-coated pits suggested from the beginning that gp330 is an endocytic receptor (3, 4). In addition to its expression in glomerular and proximal tubule epithelia, this receptor is expressed in a number of epithelia that are heavily engaged in receptor-mediated endocytosis, including type II cells of the lung and epithelial cells of the inner ear, epididymis, mammary gland, thyroid, parathyroid, yolk sac, and retina (5). Interest in this molecule was greatly enhanced when Raychowd-hury et al. (6) obtained and sequenced a partial cDNA clone which clearly established that gp330 is a member of the LDL receptor gene family (7). The complete amino acid sequence was obtained only recently (8), and this receptor was found to possess all the structural motifs characteristic of the LDL receptor family, including ligand binding, growth factor and EGF repeats, YWTD spacer regions, and the consensus (FX)NPXY endocytic internalization signal. Structurally it is quite similar to the LDL receptor related protein/a2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP), another LDL receptor family member. Based on its large size (517,715 mol wt) which proved to be larger than originally anticipated the name \"megalin\" was introduced as an alternative to gp330 (8). Ligands that bind to megalin/gp330. In the meantime the search for its ligands has identified a surprisingly diverse group …",

Two highly potent pheromones, a dihydroxyprogesterone and a prostaglandin, previously have been identified, and their effects on goldfish behavior have been studied in depth. We have cloned goldfish olfactory epithelium cDNAs belonging to two multigene G-protein coupled receptor families as a step toward elucidating the molecular basis of pheromone recognition. One gene family (GFA) consists of homologs of putative odorant receptors (approximately 320 residues) found in the olfactory epithelium of other fish and mammals. The other family (GFB) consists of homologs of putative pheromone receptors found in the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of mammals and also in the nose of pufferfish. GFB receptors (approximately 840 residues) are akin to the V2R family of VNO receptors, which possess a large extracellular N-terminal domain and are homologs of calcium-sensing and metabotropic glutamate receptors. In situ hybridization showed that the two families of goldfish receptors are differentially expressed in the olfactory epithelium. GFB mRNA is abundant in rather compact cells whose nuclei are near the apical surface. In contrast, GFA mRNA is found in elongated cells whose nuclei are positioned deeper in the epithelium. Our findings support the hypothesis that the separate olfactory organ and VNO of terrestrial vertebrates arose in evolution by the segregation of distinct classes of neurons that were differentially positioned in the olfactory epithelium of a precursor aquatic vertebrate.",

Increments in Cao result in acute and sustained increases in the intracellular calcium level (Cai), postulated to involve both a release of calcium from intracellular stores and a subsequent increase in calcium influx through nonspecific cation channels. The sustained rise in Cai appears to be necessary for keratinocyte differentiation. To understand the mechanism by which keratinocytes respond to Cao, we measured the acute effects of Cao on Cai and calcium influx in keratinocytes at various stages of differentiation. We then demonstrated the existence of the calcium receptor (CaR) in keratinocytes and determined the effect of calcium-induced differentiation on its mRNA levels. Finally, we examined the role of Cai in regulating both the initial rise in Cai after the switch to higher Cao and the activity of the nonspecific cation channel through which calcium influx occurs. Our data indicate that the acute Cai response to Cao is lost as the cells differentiate and increase their basal Cai. These data correlated with the decrease in CaR mRNA levels in cells grown in low calcium. However, calcium influx as measured by 45Ca uptake increased with differentiation in 1.2mM calcium, consistent with the increase in CaR mRNA in these cells as well as the calcium-induced opening of the nonspecific cation channels. We conclude that the keratinocyte contains a CaR that regulates both the initial release of Cai from intracellular stores and the subsequent increase in calcium flux through nonspecific calcium channels. A rising level of Cai may turn off the release of calcium from intracellular stores while potentiating the influx through the nonspecific cation channels. Differentiation of keratinocytes appears to increase the CaR, which may facilitate the maintenance of the high Cai required for differentiation.",

In a previous study, it has been shown that endothelin-1 (ET-1) signaling through heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors stimulates MAPK activity in primary cultures of astrocytes (Cazaubon, S., Parker, P. J., Strosberg, A.D., and Couraud, P.O. (1993) Biochem. J. 293, 381-386). To clarify the molecular mechanism responsible for this response, involvement of the adapter proteins, Shc and Grb2, has now been investigated. It is shown here that in these cells, ET-1 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, resulting in its stable association with Grb2 but not with Grb3-3, a Grb2 isoform with partially deleted SH2 domain. These results demonstrate that tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc specifically interacts with the SH2 domain of Grb2. This response was rapid and transient, showing a maximum at 10 min and declining at 60 min. Interestingly, direct activation of G proteins by fluoroaluminate mimics the ET-1 effect. In addition, a shift to a higher apparent molecular mass of Raf-1 kinase, likely reflecting its hyperphosphorylation, was also detected in ET-1-treated cells. These data strongly suggest that ET-1-induced MAPK activation is a G protein-coupled pathway that involves Shc, Grb2, and probably Raf-1. In conclusion, the Shc-Grb2 complex may be involved in the activation of the MAPK pathway, not only by several receptor tyrosine kinases but also by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, such as ET-1 receptors.",

            "abstract": "We characterized the in vivo, cellular and molecular pathophysiology of a case of neonatal hyperparathyroidism (NHPT) resulting from a de novo, heterozygous missense mutation in the gene for the extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+(o))-sensing receptor (CaR). The female neonate presented with moderately severe hypercalcemia, markedly undermineralized bones, and multiple metaphyseal fractures. Subtotal parathyroidectomy was performed at 6 wk; hypercalcemia recurred rapidly but the bone disease improved gradually with reversion to an asymptomatic state resembling familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FBHH). Dispersed parathyroid cells from the resected tissue showed a set-point (the level of Ca2+(o) half maximally inhibiting PTH secretion) substantially higher than for normal human parathyroid cells (approximately 1.8 vs. approximately 1.0 mM, respectively); a similar increase in set-point was observed in vivo. The proband's CaR gene showed a missense mutation (R185Q) at codon 185, while her normocalcemic parents were homozygous for wild type (WT) CaR sequence. Transient expression of the mutant R185Q CaR in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells revealed a substantially attenuated Ca2+(o)-evoked accumulation of total inositol phosphates (IP), while cotransfection of normal and mutant receptors showed an EC50 (the level of Ca2+(o) eliciting a half-maximal increase in IPs) 37% higher than for WT CaR alone (6.3+/-0.4 vs. 4.6+/-0.3 mM Ca2+(o), respectively). Thus this de novo, heterozygous CaR mutation may exert a dominant negative action on the normal CaR, producing NHPT and more severe hypercalcemia than typically seen with FBHH. Moreover, normal maternal calcium homeostasis promoted additional secondary hyperparathyroidism in the fetus, contributing to the severity of the NHPT in this case with FBHH.",

This “Ca receptor” (CaR) serves as the primary physiological regulator of parathyroid hormone secretion. Alterations in the CaR have been proposed to underlie the increases in Ca set-point seen in primary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid adenoma. We have isolated human CaR cDNAs from an adenomatous parathyroid gland. The cloned receptor, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, responds to extracellular application of physiologically relevant concentrations of Ca and other CaR agonists. The rank order of potency of CaR agonists displayed by the native receptor (Gd > neomycin B > Ca > Mg) is maintained by the expressed receptor. The nucleotide sequence of the human CaR cDNA predicts a protein of 1078 amino acids with high sequence similarity to a bovine CaR, and displays seven putative membrane-spanning regions common to G protein-coupled receptors. The deduced protein sequence shows potential sites for N-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation by protein kinase C and has a low level of sequence similarity to the metabotropic glutamate receptors. Comparison of the cDNA sequence to that of the normal human CaR gene showed no alteration in the coding region sequence of the CaR in this particular instance of parathyroid adenoma. Human cDNA clones with differing 5′-untranslated regions were isolated, suggesting alternative splicing of the parathyroid CaR mRNA. A rare variant cDNA clone representing a 10 amino acid insertion into the extracellular domain was also isolated. Northern blot analysis of normal and adenomatous parathyroid gland mRNA identified a predominant transcript of 5.4 kilobases, and less abundant transcripts of 10, 4.8 and 4.2 kilobases in RNA from the adenoma. While there is no evidence for alteration of the primary amino acid sequence of the CaR in this adenoma, modulation of CaR biosynthesis through alternative RNA processing may play a role in set-point alterations.",

Chiefly responsible for the advances is the proposition by Peart (1) that Ca plays a central role in controlling renin secretion as it does in smooth muscle contraction and relaxation. This has led to the view, based mainly on indirect evidence, that cytosolic Ca is an intracellular signal which regulates renin secretion through the baroreceptor, macula densa, and neurohormonal pathways. The specific proposal is that factors which physiologically stimulate renin secretion do so by lowering cytosolic Ca, and those which inhibit secretion do so by raising Ca (2). Thus, for example, hemodynamic factors such as renal perfusion pressure and intrarenal tissue pressure, which control renin secretion through the baroreceptor pathway, regulate Ca flux in the juxtaglomerular (JG) cells (2). Increased NaCl load at the macula densa increases adenosine production at the macula densa, and this adenosine ...",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of renal Mg handling has been expanded in recent years with the use of electron probe, ultramicroanalysis, and fluorescent dye techniques to determine total Mg and free Mg2+ in individual tubule segments and cells, respectively. Recent studies have shown that [Mg2+]i is a highly mobile cation that may be altered by a number of influences including hormones. It is likely that the hormonal changes in [Mg2+]i, reported here and elsewhere, are involved in intracellular metabolism and regulation rather than transepithelial transport. The role of intracellular Mg2+ in control of cell function is poorly understood. However, it is evident that [Mg2+]i may be rapidly charged through a number of different influences that may have important effects on cell function. These kinds of data have enlarged our understanding of Mg conservation by the renal tubule but have posed many questions for further study. Magnesium is handled in different ways along the nephron. About 80% of the total plasma Mg (1.5-2.0 mM) is ultrafilterable across the glomerular membrane. Of the ultrafilterable Mg (1.2-1.6 mM), only 20-25% is reabsorbed by the proximal tubule, including the convoluted and straight portions. This is in contrast to Na and Ca reabsorption, which amounts to approximately 70 and 60%, respectively, in the proximal nephron. Accordingly, the fractional delivery of Mg to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is much greater than that of Na or Ca. It is now evident from micropuncture studies that proportionally greater amounts of Mg (50-60%) are reabsorbed in the loop compared with Na (20-25%) or Ca (30-35%). Because the terminal nephron segments, including the DCT and collecting tubule, reabsorb only a small portion of the filtered Mg (approximately 5%), the loop of Henle plays a major role in the determination of Mg reabsorption, and it is in this segment that the major regulatory factors act to maintain Mg balance. Magnesium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb takes place in the cortical segments, at least in the mouse and rat. Evidence summarized here suggests that Mg is passively reabsorbed via the paracellular pathway in the cTAL of the loop of Henle. Several factors affect Mg reabsorption in the loop of Henle. Hypermagnesemia and hypercalcemia inhibit reabsorption leading to increased urinary excretion of Mg and Ca. These effects have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (113, 149). Magnesium depletion, for instance through dietary Mg deprivation, enhances Mg reabsorption in the loop of Henle before the fall in plasma Mg concentration and filtered Mg load.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Seven years after total parathyroidectomy he remained hypocalcaemic, with biochemical evidence of hypoparathyroidism (enhanced renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate, low nephrogenic cyclic AMP excretion, and reduced serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the presence of normal renal function and normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels). Iv infusions of calcium were given before and 6 years after total parathyroidectomy. The renal tubular reabsorption of calcium was compared in these two situations. No difference was found. Before and after parathyroidectomy there was enhanced renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. It is concluded that the enhanced renal tubular reabsorption of calcium in FHH is independent of parathyroid hormone. Total parathyroidectomy corrects the hypercalcaemia in FHH by a reduction in the input of calcium into the extra-cellular fluid from gut and or bone perhaps as a result of reduced renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol.",

A rat cell line of C-cell origin (rMTC 44-2) secretes calcitonin and neurotensin in response to small increases in external Ca2+. To better understand the mechanism of extracellular Ca2+ sensing in this cell type, we studied single fura-2-loaded rMTC 44-2 cells perfused with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ and K+. In the basal state (Ca2+ = 0.5 mM), cytosolic Ca2+ levels were 53 nM, with 27% of the cells having spikes or oscillations. With elevation of the external Ca2+ to between 0.5 and 4 mM, 84% of the cells showed a rapid (less than 5 s) rise in cytosolic Ca2+ to values 2- to 10-fold higher than basal levels. Most of the responding cells exhibited complex patterns of cytosolic Ca2+ fluctuations, including oscillations with frequencies varying from less than 1/min to as many as 6/min. When averaged over time, the cytosolic Ca2+ of individual cells showed a dose-dependent response with changes in external Ca2+, resembling the relationship between extracellular Ca2+ and calcitonin secretion. With continued or repeated stimulation, the spike amplitude often declined. These cytosolic Ca2+ responses were attenuated in the presence of the Ca(2+)-channel blockers cadmium and nifedipine. Cytosolic Ca2+ responses to perfusion with elevated K+ (20 mM) were similar in waveform to those seen with Ca2+ stimulation. Most cells displayed cytosolic Ca2+ changes in response to both ionic secretagogues when stimulated with external Ca2+ or K+.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Upon agonist binding and receptor activation, a series of reactions participate in the turn off or desensitization of GPRs. Many GPRs are phosphorylated by protein kinases and consequently uncoupled from G proteins. In addition, many GPRs are sequestered from the cell surface and become inaccessible to their activating ligands. Both receptor:G protein uncoupling and receptor sequestration may involve the participation of arrestins or other proteins. A model for receptor regulation has been developed from studies of the beta-adrenergic receptor. However, recent studies suggest that other GPRs important in the cardiovascular system, such as the muscarinic cholinergic receptors that regulate heart rate, might be regulated by mechanisms other than those that regulate the beta-adrenergic receptors. This review summarizes our current understanding of the processes involved in the desensitization of GPRs.",

We hypothesized that chondrocytes detect changes in the extracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]o) and modify their function. The effects of changing [Ca2+]o on the expression of matrix proteins were quantified by staining of cartilage nodules with alcian green and assessing RNA levels of cartilage-specific genes in chondrogenic RCJ3.1C5.18 (C5.18) cells. Alcian green staining in these cells decreased with increasing [Ca2+]o in a dose-dependent and reversible manner (ID50, approximately 2 mM Ca2+). RNA levels for aggrecan and type II collagen decreased with increasing [Ca2+]o (ID50, approximately 2.0 and 4.1 mM Ca2+, respectively). RNA levels for type X collagen and alkaline phosphatase were also reduced by high [Ca2+]o with ID50 values of approximately 2.9 and 1.6 mM Ca2+, respectively. These responses were rapid, in that increasing [Ca2+]o from 1.0 to more than 6 mM suppressed aggrecan RNA levels by about 50%, and lowering [Ca2+]o from 2.9 to 1.0 mM increased aggrecan RNA levels by about 300% within 4 h. As Ca2+ receptors (CaRs) mediate extracellular Ca2+ sensing in parathyroid and kidney, we assessed the expression of CaRs in these cells. C5.18 cells stained positively for CaR protein with an anti-CaR antiserum and for CaR RNA by in situ hybridization. An approximately 150-kDa protein was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CaR antiserum. CaR antisense oligonucleotides suppressed the expression of CaR protein and enhanced RNA levels of aggrecan in C5.18 cells. These data support the idea that CaRs are expressed in this cell system and may be involved in regulating chondrogenic gene expression.",

The functional significance of dimerization of this receptor was suggested by our earlier observations that CaRs carrying certain point mutations exert dominant negative effects on the function of the coexpressed wild-type receptor both in vivo and when cotransfected in human embryonic kidney cells. In this study, we explored the functional consequences of CaR dimerization. Coexpression in human embryonic kidney cells of specific pairs of mutant CaRs, each with reduced or absent activity because of distinct loss-of-function mutations, results in the formation of heterodimers and partially reconstitutes extracellular calcium-dependent signaling. Moreover, our results suggest that the CaR has at least two functionally separable domains. However, the presence of an abnormal domain in each mutant monomer substantially impairs the function of the CaR heterodimer, resulting in the reconstituted CaRs having characteristics distinct from those of the wild-type CaR. Our study suggests that intermolecular interactions within the dimeric CaR are important for the receptor's function.",

The rise in HC-3 secretion was slightly greater than that in H+, resulting in a decrease in net acidity. Fundic mucosa isolated from frogs was used to study the mechanisms of the stimulatory actions. An increase in Ca++ concentration in the nutrient (serosal) bathing solution from 1.8 to 7.2 mM stimulated H+ transport in this preparation. The effect of raising Ca++ concentration was inhibited by the histamine H2 receptor antagonist Metiamide and by increasing nutrient Mg++. Stimulation of H+ transport, sensitive to Metiamide, was also observed with the calcium ionophore A23187 (4 micrograms/ml, nutrient side). The results indicate that at the mucosal level, Ca++ stimulates H+ transport by release of histamine from mucosal stores with properties similar to those of mast cells. Transport of HCO-3 in isolated mucosae was studied after inhibition of H+ transport my metiamide. An increase in nutrient Ca++ concentration stimulated the HCO-3 transport but the calcium ionophore had no effect. This action of Ca++ was abolished by atropine (10(-6) M) and by raising nutrient Mg++, suggesting that it reflects release of acetylcholine from intramucosal nervous tissue. Thus Ca++ stimulated gastric transport of both H+ and HCO-3 in vivo and in vitro but evidence for a direct action on the transporting (parietal and epithelial) cells was not obtained.",

            "abstract": "Calcium sensing receptors are part of a growing G protein-coupled receptor family, which includes metabotropic glutamate, γ-aminoisobutyric acid, and pheromone receptors. The distinctive structural features of this family include large extracellular domains that bind agonist and large intracellular, carboxyl-terminal domains of as yet undefined function(s). We have explored the contribution(s) of the carboxyl terminus of the human calcium sensing receptor (CaR) by assessing extracellular Ca2+-mediated changes in intracellular Ca2+ in individual HEK-293 cells transfected with CaR clones. In-frame fusion of EGFP to the carboxyl terminus of CaR had no effect on either the dose response for extracellular Ca2+ activation or CaR desensitization. Carboxyl-terminal truncations, fused in-frame with EGFP (CaRΔ1024-EGFP, CaRΔ908-EGFP, CaRΔ886-EGFP, and CaRΔ868-EGFP), were assessed for alterations in Ca2+-dependent activation or desensitization. Significant effects on the dose-response relation for extracellular Ca2+ were observed only for the CaRΔ868 truncation, which exhibited a decreased affinity for extracellular Ca2+ and a decrease in the apparent cooperativity for Ca2+-dependent activation. The alterations in extracellular Ca2+ affinity and cooperativity observed with CaRΔ868 were recapitulated by a point mutation, T876D, in the full-length CaR-EGFP background. All truncations with wild type dose-response relations exhibited desensitization time courses that were comparable to the full-length CaR, whereas the CaRΔ868 receptor desensitized completely after two exposures to 10 mmCa2+. Interestingly, the CaR point mutation T876D exhibited desensitization comparable to wild type CaR, suggesting that this mutation specifically modifies CaR cooperativity. In conclusion, these studies suggest that amino acid residues between 868 and 886 are critical to the apparent cooperativity of Ca2+-mediated activation of G proteins and to CaR desensitization.",

            "abstract": "Receptors coupled to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) are integral membrane proteins involved in the transmission of signals from the extracellular environment to the cytoplasm. The best known family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), currently comprising more than 1000 members, exhibits a common structural motif consisting of seven membrane-spanning regions (1) (Fig. 1). A diverse array of external stimuli including neurotransmitters, hormones, phospholipids, photons, odorants, certain taste ligands, and growth factors can activate specific members of this receptor family and promote interaction between the receptor and the G protein on the intracellular side of the membrane. This causes the exchange of GDP for GTP bound to the G protein a subunit and apparently the dissociation of the bg heterodimers. In turn, GTP-bound G protein a subunits or bg complexes initiate intracellular signaling responses by acting on effector molecules such as adenylate cyclases or phospholipases or directly regulating ion channel or kinase function (Fig. 1, and see below). Sixteen distinct mammalian G protein a subunits have been molecularly cloned and are divided into four families based upon sequence similarity: as, ai, aq, and a12. Similarly, eleven G protein g subunits and five G protein b subunits have been identified. Thus, GPCRs are likely to represent the most diverse signal transduction systems in eukaryotic cells. The biochemical and biological consequences of such diversity in subunit composition and coupling specificity for each receptor have just begun to be elucidated. In this review, we will briefly describe the role of G proteins and their coupled receptors in normal growth control and tumorigenesis and then focus on current efforts to elucidate the signaling pathways connecting this class of cell surface receptors to nuclear events regulating gene expression.",

The CaR plays a central role in mediating, on one hand, the inhibitory effect of Ca2+(0) on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and, on the other, the stimulatory action of Ca2+(0) on calcitonin secretion, which provide for a sophisticated, bi-directional regulation of the secretion of calciotropic hormones mediated by the same receptor. Indeed Ca2+(0) itself can be viewed as a calciotropic 'hormone' acting, along with PTH and calcinotin (CT), on its target tissues involved in mineral ion homeostasis, particularly the kidney. In the kidney, Ca2+zero, acting via the CaR, controls renal handling of divalent mineral ions in the cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL) and perhaps also in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). In CTAL the CaR not only affects renal calcium handling indirectly by modulating the secretion of PTH but also directly at the level of the tubule, where it is localized on the same basolateal surface of the cells where the PTH receptor is located. Moreover, renal CaRs likely subserve important functions involved in integrating mineral ion metabolism with the homeostasis of water and, perhaps, monovalent cations (e.g., elevating Ca2+(0) produces a CaR-mediated inhibition of NaCl reabsorption in the CTAL). More recent data, however, accumulated since the cloning of the CaR, have suggested additional roles of the receptor in cells uninvolved in mineral ion metabolism. Examples include the brain, intestine and skin, where the receptor may regulate, respectively, the activities of ion channels and probably other neuronal functions, proliferation of the cells of the colonic crypts and differentiation of keratinocytes, presumably in response to local changes in Ca2+(0). It is also possible that the the CaR responds to other endogenous agonists, either polyvalent agonists, such as Mg2+(0) or organic polycations, including spermine or even protamine. Finally additional studies are needed to determine whether there are additional members of a putative family of structurally-related ion-sensing GPCRs, such as that apparently present in osteoblasts that sense Ca2+(0) and, perhaps, in other cell types that recognize additional ions [e.g., Cd2+(0) in dermal fibroblasts (Smith et al., 1989)].",

The amino acid sequence predicted from this cDNA is 81% homologous to the murine 5-HT3 receptor subunits cloned from NCB20 and N1E-115 cells. The splice variants code for two proteins differing by a deletion of six amino acids located in the large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains M3 and M4. For characterization, the cloned 5-HT3 cDNA was expressed in HEK 293 cells, and the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the recombinant ion/channel/receptor complex were investigated by patch clamping. Our data reveal that the cloned cDNAs code for guinea pig 5-HT3 receptors, which functionally assemble as homo-oligomers. The kinetic behavior of the ion channel and its sensitivity to several agonists and antagonists were markedly different from those of the cloned 5-HT3 receptors from mouse and human under similar experimental conditions. The agonists used were 5-hydroxytryptamine, 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, 1-phenylbiguanide (PBG), m-chlorophenylbiguanide, and the antagonists tropisetron and metoclopramide. In addition, 5-HT, PBG, and tropisetron were investigated through radioligand binding to isolated membranes. Compared with the human and murine 5-HT3 receptors, the guinea pig receptor showed prolonged desensitization kinetics. In addition, the guinea pig 5-HT3 receptor did not respond to the selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist PBG. Construction of chimeric receptors between guinea pig and human 5-HT3 receptor sequences localized the differences in desensitization kinetics to the carboxyl-terminal domain and the ligand binding site to the amino-terminal domain of the receptor protein. Molecular determinants of the PBG binding site of the human 5-HT3 receptor were localized to a 28-amino-acid spanning region adjacent to the M1 region.",

Although cloned over a decade ago, little is known about their properties because wild-type ORs do not efficiently reach the cell surface following heterologous expression. Receptor-receptor interactions strongly influence surface trafficking of other GPCRs, and we examined whether a similar mechanism might be involved in OR surface expression. Olfactory neurons are known to express beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs), and we found that coexpression with beta(2)-ARs, but not any other AR subtypes, dramatically increased mouse 71 (M71) OR surface expression in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. A persistent physical interaction between M71 ORs and beta(2)-ARs was shown by coimmunoprecipitation and by cointernalization of the two receptors in response to their specific ligands. Also, coexpression of wild-type M71 ORs with beta(2)-ARs resulted in cAMP responses to the M71 ligand acetophenone. Finally, in situ hybridization studies showed extensive colocalization of M71 OR and beta(2)-AR expression in mouse olfactory epithelium. These data demonstrate the successful heterologous surface expression of a functional wild-type OR and reveal that persistent physical association with other GPCRs can control OR surface expression.",

            "abstract": "A cDNA clone encoding the high affinity Ca2+-binding protein (HACBP) of rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum was isolated and sequenced. The cDNA encoded a protein of 418 amino acids, but a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein indicates that a 17-residue NH2-terminal signal sequence was removed during synthesis. This was confirmed by studies of in vitro translation of mRNA encoding the protein. Structural predictions did not reveal any potential transmembrane segments in the protein. The COOH-terminal sequence of the high affinity Ca2+-binding protein, Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, is the same as that proposed to be an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (Munro, S., and Pelham, H. R. B. (1987) Cell 48, 899-907). All of these characteristics suggest that the protein is localized in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The mature protein of Mr 46,567 contains 109 acidic and 52 basic amino acids. Structural predictions suggest that the first half of the molecule forms a globular domain of 8 anti-parallel beta-strands with a helix-turn-helix motif at the extreme NH2 terminus. The next one-third of the sequence is proline-rich. This segment can be subdivided into a charged region which contains a 17-amino acid repeat, followed by a proline, serine, and threonine-rich segment extending from Pro-246 to Thr-316. Thirty-seven acidic residues are clustered within 56 amino acids at the COOH terminus of the protein. Although the protein binds 1 mol of Ca2+/mol with high affinity, no \"EF-hand\" consensus sequence was observed in the protein. The acidic COOH terminus, however, could account for the low affinity, high capacity Ca2+ binding observed in the protein. In agreement with other involved laboratories, we have chosen the name calreticulin for the protein.",

Here we report experiments on the role of the glycosylation in rhodopsin folding and function. Nonglycosylated opsin was prepared by expression of a wild-type bovine opsin gene in COS-1 cells in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation. The non-glycosylated opsin folded correctly as shown by its normal palmitoylation, transport to the cell surface, and the formation of the characteristic rhodopsin chromophore (lambda max, 500 nm) with 11-cis-retinal. However, the nonglycosylated rhodopsin showed strikingly low light-dependent activation of GT at concentration levels comparable with those of glycosylated rhodopsin. Amino acid replacements at positions 2 and 15 and the cognate tripeptide consensus sequence [Asn-2-->Gln, Gly-3-->Cys(Pro), Thr-4-->Lys, Asn-15-->Ala(Cys, Glu, Lys, Gln, Arg), Lys-16-->Cys(Arg), Thr-17-->Met(Val)] showed that the substitutions at Asn-2, Gly-3, and Thr-4 had no significant effect on the folding, cellular transport, and/or function of rhodopsin, whereas those at Asn-15 and Lys-16 caused poor folding and were defective in transport to the cell surface. Further, mutant pigments with amino acid replacements at Asn-15 and Thr-17 activated GT very poorly. We conclude that Asn-15 glycosylation is important in signal transduction.",

Since the 1970s, an array of public health interventions and national dietary guidelines has sought to reduce sodium intake. However, the U.S. population still consumes more sodium than is recommended, placing individuals at risk for diseases related to elevated blood pressure. Strategies to Reduce Sodium Intake in the United States evaluates and makes recommendations about strategies that could be implemented to reduce dietary sodium intake to levels recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The book reviews past and ongoing efforts to reduce the sodium content of the food supply and to motivate consumers to change behavior. Based on past lessons learned, the book makes recommendations for future initiatives. It is an excellent resource for federal and state public health officials, the processed food and food service industries, health care professionals, consumer advocacy groups, and academic researchers.",

In each study binary combinations of three or four concentrations of one bitter compound with four concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 M) of one salt were rated for bitterness and saltiness using the method of magnitude estimation. In most cases, perceived bitterness was suppressed by salts, although the degree of suppression varied. In general, bitterness suppression was not accompanied by an equivalent reciprocal suppression of saltiness. Only MgSO4 and amiloride had suppressing effects on the saltiness of NaCl at the intermediate concentrations and no bitter compound affected the saltiness at the high concentrations of NaCl. Since salt suppressed the bitterness of urea effectively, a detailed analysis of suppression of the bitterness of urea by different salts was conducted. Those studies indicated that the key component in this effect was the sodium or lithium ion for two reasons: first, all three sodium salts and the lithium salt had a suppressive effect on bitterness, whereas KCl did not; secondly, the effect of a salt on suppression of the bitterness of urea was independent of its perceived saltiness; that is, NaCl, Na-acetate (which is perceived as less salty than NaCl), and Na-gluconate (which is perceived as less salty than Na-acetate) reduced bitterness comparably. These results suggest that there is a major peripheral component to the suppression of the bitterness of urea, and perhaps other bitter tasting compounds, by sodium.",

Most natural cheese varieties, apart from the low pH, fresh, short shelf life, acid-curd types, such as Fromage frais, Quark (and related types), contain added salt (NaCl). Salt in cheese results mainly from the direct addition of salt, but it may also be added indirectly by way of dressings or condiments, such as cream dressing in cottage cheese. The sodium content of pasteurized processed cheeses (including cheese spreads) and substitute/imitation cheese analogues is generally much higher than that of natural cheeses. The contribution of cheese to dietary sodium depends on types and quantities consumed, with a high per capita consumption of fresh acid curd cheeses as in Germany contributing much less than a high consumption of high salt varieties, such as Feta or Blue cheese. Salting of cheese and the role of salt on the biochemistry, microbiology and sensory quality of cheese has been extensively researched and reviewed. In contrast, little information is available on the role of salt or more specifically, sodium, in dairy spreads, including pasteurised processed cheese products or milk fat spreads. This chapter discusses the functions of salt in cheese products and dairy spreads and the means by which the sodium levels of these products may be reduced.",

The labeled-line (sparse coding) view differs from the across-neuron pattern (ensemble) counterpoint in proposing that activity in a given class of neurons is necessary and sufficient to generate a specific taste perception. This article critically reviews molecular, electro-physiological, and behavioral findings that bear on the issue. In the peripheral gustatory system, the authors conclude that most qualities appear to be signaled by labeled lines; however, elements of both types of coding characterize signaling of sodium salts. Given the heterogeneity of neuronal tuning functions in the brain, the central coding mechanism is less clear. Both sparse coding and neuronal ensemble models remain viable possibilities. Furthermore, temporal patterns of discharge could contribute additional information. Ultimately, until specific classes of neurons can be selectively manipulated and perceptual consequences assessed, it will be difficult to go beyond mere correlation and conclusively discern the validity of these coding models.",

            "abstract": "Although domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) possess an otherwise functional sense of taste, they, unlike most mammals, do not prefer and may be unable to detect the sweetness of sugars. One possible explanation for this behavior is that cats lack the sensory system to taste sugars and therefore are indifferent to them. Drawing on work in mice, demonstrating that alleles of sweet-receptor genes predict low sugar intake, we examined the possibility that genes involved in the initial transduction of sweet perception might account for the indifference to sweet-tasting foods by cats. We characterized the sweet-receptor genes of domestic cats as well as those of other members of the Felidae family of obligate carnivores, tiger and cheetah. Because the mammalian sweet-taste receptor is formed by the dimerization of two proteins (T1R2 and T1R3; gene symbols Tas1r2 and Tas1r3), we identified and sequenced both genes in the cat by screening a feline genomic BAC library and by performing PCR with degenerate primers on cat genomic DNA. Gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR of taste tissue, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. The cat Tas1r3 gene shows high sequence similarity with functional Tas1r3 genes of other species. Message from Tas1r3 was detected by RT-PCR of taste tissue. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that Tas1r3 is expressed, as expected, in taste buds. However, the cat Tas1r2 gene shows a 247-base pair microdeletion in exon 3 and stop codons in exons 4 and 6. There was no evidence of detectable mRNA from cat Tas1r2 by RT-PCR or in situ hybridization, and no evidence of protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Tas1r2 in tiger and cheetah and in six healthy adult domestic cats all show the similar deletion and stop codons. We conclude that cat Tas1r3 is an apparently functional and expressed receptor but that cat Tas1r2 is an unexpressed pseudogene. A functional sweet-taste receptor heteromer cannot form, and thus the cat lacks the receptor likely necessary for detection of sweet stimuli. This molecular change was very likely an important event in the evolution of the cat's carnivorous behavior.",

            "abstract": "Taste reception is fundamental to diet selection in many animals. The genetic basis underlying the evolution and diversity of taste reception, however, is not well understood. Recent discoveries of T1R sweet/umami receptor genes and T2R bitter receptor genes in humans and mice provided an opportunity to address this question. Here, we report the identification of 20 putatively functional T1R genes and 167 T2R genes from the genome sequences of nine vertebrates, including three fishes, one amphibian, one bird, and four mammals. Our comparative genomic analysis shows that orthologous T1R sequences are relatively conserved in evolution and that the T1R gene repertoire remains virtually constant in size across most vertebrates, except for the loss of the T1R2 sweet receptor gene in the sweet-insensitive chicken and the absence of all T1R genes in the tongueless western clawed frog. In contrast, orthologous T2R sequences are more variable, and the T2R repertoire diverges tremendously among species, from only three functional genes in the chicken to 49 in the frog. These evolutionary patterns suggest the relative constancy in the number and type of sweet and umami tastants encountered by various vertebrates or low binding specificities of T1Rs but a large variation in the number and type of bitter compounds detected by different species. Although the rate of gene duplication is much lower in T1Rs than in T2Rs, signals of positive selection are detected during the functional divergences of paralogous T1Rs, as was previously found among paralogous T2Rs. Thus, functional divergence and specialization of taste receptors generally occurred via adaptive evolution.",

H values range from 0.0 for narrow tuning to 1.0 for broad tuning. Based on the responses of depolarizing receptor potentials of 26 rat taste cells to the four basic taste stimuli, taste cells were classified into nine NaCl-best, four Q-HCl (quinine-HCl)-best, 10 HCl-best and three sucrose-best cells. NaCl-best cells were narrowly tuned to the four basic taste stimuli, but the other three stimuli-best cells were broadly tuned to the stimuli. In all, 85% of the taste cells responded to more than one of four basic taste stimuli. The mean H values for NaCl-best, Q-HCl-best, HCl-best and sucrose-best cells were 0.285, 0.832, 0.781 and 0.796 respectively. The mean H value for all 26 taste cells was 0.621. This was larger than H in rat gustatory fibers. Transformation of large H values in taste cells into small H values in taste fibers may be due to a non-random interaction between taste cells and taste fibers during the synaptic formation. Broad tuning properties of rat taste cells suggest that the across-taste cell response pattern may play an important role in taste quality coding mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "To investigate the dynamic aspects of gustatory activity, we recorded the responses of small ensembles of cortical neurons to tastants administered to awake rats. Multiple trials of each tastant were delivered during recordings made in oral somatosensory (SI) and gustatory cortex (GC). When integrated tastant responses (firing rates averaged across 2.5 sec) were compared with water responses, 14.4% (13/90) of the GC neurons responded in a taste-specific manner. When time was considered as a source of information, however, the incidence of taste-specific firing increased: as many as 41% (37/90) of the recorded GC neurons exhibited taste-specific patterns of response. For 17% of the neurons identified as responding with taste-specific patterns, the stimulus that caused the most significant response was a function of the time since stimulus delivery. That is, a single neuron might respond most strongly to one tastant in the first 500 msec of a response and then respond most strongly to another tastant later in the response. Further analysis of the time courses of GC and SI cortical neural responses revealed that modulations of GC firing rate arose from three separable processes: early somatosensory input (less than ∼0.2 sec post-stimulus), later chemosensory input (∼0.2–1 sec), and delayed somatosensory input related to orofacial responses (more than ∼1.0 sec). These data demonstrate that sensory information is available in the time course of GC responses and suggest the viability of views of gustatory processing that treat the temporal structure of cortical responses as an integral part of the neural code.",

No differences were found between strains B and D in acuity threshold or aversion threshold. The B mice had a lower threshold for preference and drank more from the higher concentrations when the six solutions were simul- taneously presented. The F, hybrids responded like the B mice. The preference and avoidance thresholds are shown in Figure 1. Note that in comparison with the two other genotypes the area of preference for the D mice is restricted both with respect to range of concentrations (horizontal dimension) and to intensity of preference when it occurs (vertical dimension). This pattern sug- gests the complete dominance of the B strain's prefer- ence for saccharin. The hypothesis was further sup- ported by the response to saccharin of both strains and their hybrid during food deprivation s . Pelz et al. 9 also found large differences between inbred strains and feral mice in their preference for saccharin, and although they reported no data from crosses beyond the F,, their results are compatible with the hypothesis of single-locus regulation of preference for saccharin at moderate concentrations.

Two putative taste receptors for glutamate have been identified, a truncated form of mGluR4 (taste-mGluR4) and the presumed heterodimer T1R1 + T1R3. Both receptors respond to glutamate when expressed in heterologous cells, but the G protein involved is not known. Galpha-Gustducin mediates the transduction of several bitter and sweet compounds; however, its role in umami has not been determined. We used standard two-bottle preference tests on alpha-gustducin knockout (KO) and wildtype (WT) mice to compare preferences for ascending concentrations of MSG and MSG + 5'-inosine monophosphate (IMP). A Latin Square was used to assign the order of tastants presented to each mouse. Statistical comparisons between KO and WT mice revealed that whereas WT mice preferred solutions of MSG and MSG + IMP over water, KO mice showed little preference for these stimuli. Denatonium and sucrose served as control stimuli and, as shown previously, WT mice prefered sucrose and avoided denatonium significantly more than did KO mice. Naive mice were also tested, and while prior exposure to taste stimuli influenced the magnitude of the preferences, experience did not change the overall pattern of intake. These data suggest that alpha-gustducin plays a role in glutamate taste.",

Compared to many other fermented foods it has a relatively high pH and fat content, a solid consistency and a higher buffering capacity. Together these features probably afford improved protection of biological activity during manufacture, storage and gastrointestinal transit. However, it is desirable that probiotics and biogenics are technologically compatible with the cheese manufacturing process. Therefore, some important characteristics of probiotic strains and biogenics need to be assessed when considering cheese as the delivery matrix. Additionally, it is important that the delivery and generation of bioactive materials in cheeses does not disturb the cheese ecosystem by interfering with cheese maturation and/or flavour development. To date, many probiotic cheeses have been made without changing the manufacturing process by using probiotics as adjuncts with the starter cultures. Additionally, spray-dried skim milk powders containing probiotic Lactobacillus cultures have been developed which can be added as direct vat inoculants for cheddar cheese manufacture. Moreover, cheese itself is recognised as a natural source of bioactive peptides which originate from the proteolytic action of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on milk proteins during cheese manufacture and/or maturation.",

In developed countries, demand for livestock products is stagnating, while many production systems are increasing their efficiency and environmental sustainability. Historical changes in the demand for livestock products have been largely driven by human population growth, income growth and urbanization and the production response in different livestock systems has been associated with science and technology as well as increases in animal numbers. In the future, production will increasingly be affected by competition for natural resources, particularly land and water, competition between food and feed and by the need to operate in a carbon-constrained economy. Developments in breeding, nutrition and animal health will continue to contribute to increasing potential production and further efficiency and genetic gains. Livestock production is likely to be increasingly affected by carbon constraints and environmental and animal welfare legislation. Demand for livestock products in the future could be heavily moderated by socio-economic factors such as human health concerns and changing socio-cultural values. There is considerable uncertainty as to how these factors will play out in different regions of the world in the coming decades.",

            "abstract": "This paper gives an overview of the availability, nutritive quality, and possible strategies to improve the utilization of rice straw as a feed ingredient for ruminants. Approximately 80% of the rice in the world is grown by small-scale farmers in developing countries, including South East Asia. The large amount of rice straw as a by-product of the rice production is mainly used as a source of feed for ruminant livestock. Rice straw is rich in polysaccharides and has a high lignin and silica content, limiting voluntary intake and reducing degradability by ruminal microorganisms. Several methods to improve the utilization of rice straw by ruminants have been investigated in the past. However, some physical treatments are not practical because of the requirement for machinery or treatments are not economical feasible for the farmers. Chemical treatments, such as NaOH, NH3 or urea, currently seem to be more practical for on-farm use. Alternative treatments to improve the nutritive value of rice straw are the use of ligninolytic fungi (white-rot fungi), with their extracellular ligninolytic enzymes, or specific enzymes degrading cellulose and/or hemicellulose. The use of fungi or enzyme treatments is expected to be a more practical and environmental-friendly approach for enhancing the nutritive value of rice straw and can be cost-effective in the future. Using fungi and enzymes might be combined with the more classical chemical or physical treatments. However, available data on using fungi and enzymes for improving the quality of rice straw are relatively scarce.",

            "abstract": "Ethiopia is one of the least developed countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with nearly 100 million people, of which 80.5% of the rural population is relied on agriculture for their livelihoods.1,2 In the country, one-third of rural households cannot produce adequate food to meet their subsistence needs as they cultivate less than half hectares of land per capita.3 Ethiopia is vulnerable to the twin threats of natural resource degradation and poverty owing to high population growth, dependent on rain fed agriculture, and negative impacts of climate changes.4 Although anthropogenic and natural shocks resulted in adverse effects on food production, the government has made considerable efforts to produce adequate food for the growing population. As population rises, demand for food, energy and income increases.5 Increasing population coupled with land degradation aggravates challenges of crop production.6 Overpopulation resulted in land resource scarcity, fragmentation of farm plots, and ecological degradation such as increasing emissions, soil erosion, deforestation, and the overuse of natural resources.7–9 Producing adequate food for a rapidly growing population is a prime challenge for development.10 Despite economic development improved in Ethiopia,11,12 the country has suffered with multifaceted challenges including land scarcity, malnutrition, recurrent drought and lack of agricultural technologies.13–15 The existing agricultural land is unable to feed the growing population and thus many Ethiopians remain trapped in vicious circle of poverty, disease and hunger.7 Rising in food prices, unemployment, lack of pasture for livestock, and intensive removal of natural vegetation aggravates food shortages. Further land redistribution is not anticipated in the near future, because landholdings are already small and subjected to more divisions and fragmentations. Parents redistribute their land to their children when the children establish their own family16 and have an impact on food shortages and household incomes.17 consequently, arable land per capita declines while land degradation increases through overuse of land resources. Lands access to irrigation schemes, adjacent to urban centres, access to roads and other basic services have high rental values.18 Population pressure is the most fundamental driving force for land conversions.19,20 Even though rural development policies adopted intensification and commercialization strategies, land expansions overshadow intensification. In line with agricultural extensification, pasturelands and the natural vegetation are converted to farmlands and commercial investments in some parts of Ethiopia.21 On the other hand, the current regime has started to tailor fertilizer distribution based on soil maps so that farmers apply a custom-based fertilizer to mitigate the depletion of soil nutrients based on sitespecific soil amendments. This type of agricultural intensification is implemented by means of internally adopted and externally imported technologies. Despite apparent yield improvements has been reported, evidences on the adoption of new technologies particularly animal breeds and crop varieties are not overwhelming.22–25 This paper presents agricultural implications of population dynamics based on the current evidences of knowledge on agriculture and population. The review helps to understand the link between agricultural growth and population dynamics in Ethiopia. Development theories and empirical literatures are crucial evidences to conceptualize the link between agriculture and population growth.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to review the nutrient requirements and feed resource availability for cattle in the tropical Africa. Cattle require consistent source of protein, energy, minerals, vitamins and water to maintain productivity and health. The nutrient requirements of cattle can be broken down into maintenance, lactation, growth and reproduction requirements. Forages have the ability to supply all the energy needed to maintain highly-productive cattle throughout the growing season, but only managed intensively. Legume-grass pasture will easily have protein content greater than 18% during the vegetative stage, as plants mature, the nutrient values lowers. Cattle require 3 to 30 gallons of water per day, at the rate of one gallon of water per 45 kg body weight during wet season and two gallons of water per 45 kg body weight during hot weather. Supplementation of low quality roughage is done by feeding limiting nutrients in the form of concentrates (energy and protein), minerals, non-protein nitrogenous (NPN) substances (urea and poultry litter) or green forages. However, in Nigeria, forage quality and availability vary greatly from season to season which however, affect the output of the animals. The nutritive value of pastures fall rapidly with maturity and, during the dry season, the available feed is lignified. Likewise, protein, vitamins and mineral elements are limited in grassland pastures during the dry season. Crop residues, by-products and browse plants remained the most outstanding feed supplements for cattle and other livestock in Nigeria.",

Notably, methane production in ruminants causes energy loss for the animal and emitted methane contributes significantly to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The present study focuses on selectively inhibiting of the methanogens using 2–bromoethanesulfonate (BES) and its effect on ruminal fermentation in an anaerobic rumen bioreactor model system. It was found that BES inhibited methane production (99.7%) and that addition of BES decreased the total VFA productivity from 3 g/L/day to 1.3 g/L/day. Our study also found that addition of BES not only inhibited the methanogens, but also had an impact on the non-methanogenic bacteria as well, resulting in a decrease in the acetic acid productivity from 1.8 g/L/day, in a reactor without BES to 0.8 g/L/day in reactor with BES added. Endoglucanase assay revealed that addition of BES further inhibits cellulolytic microbes, resulting in a decrease in endoglucanase concentration in the reactor supplemented with BES. A notable increase in hydrogen partial pressure was seen in the reactor with BES (from 1.7% to 29.8%).",

Sixteen herbaceous species were evaluated for crude protein (CP), Neutral detergent fiber (NDF), Acid detergent fiber (ADF), Acid detergent lignin (ADL) and ash. The average CP content during the main rainy season was 8.8% with the highest value of 10.6%. During dry season the CP content of samples was generally below 6%. CP content was also varied significantly among individual species. Commelina africana accounted for the highest CP content, while Heteropogon contortus exhibited the lowest CP content. At the early stage of growth of plants, a low accumulation of NDF, ADF and ADL was recorded. Digitaria naghellensis accounted for the highest NDF, while Commelina africana had the highest ADL content. The ash content was lowered for most of the species with increased stage of maturity. The level of CP, NDF, ADF, ADL and ash in the species were greatly influenced by the study site. CP was negatively correlated with NDF, ADF, and ADL. It is suggested that the forages may be utilized at a proper stage to provide optimum nutrients for animals in the study area.",

Rice straw was divided into moist straw, soaked straw for 24 h without pasteurization and soaked for 24 h and pasteurized at 100 °C/1 h, and all of them were inoculated with different microbial inoculants.ResultsMoistened rice straw inoculated with Azotobacter chroococcum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae recorded the highest significant reduction in organic matter percent, 74.21%. The highest significant reductions in crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber percent were recorded in moistened rice straw inoculated with Azospirillum brasilense and Saccharomyces cerevisiae which gave 27.54, 55.39 and 42.47%, respectively. The highest significant increase in crude protein percent, 13.71%, was recorded in rice straw soaked for 24 h and inoculated with Azospirillum brasilense and Bacillus megaterium. The combined interaction between microbial treatments and physical pretreatments of rice straw gave a significant decrease in organic matter, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber %, as well as a significant increase in crude protein % compared to control. Addition of nitrogen fixers to rice straw improved its nitrogen contents.ConclusionsThis study showed the possibility of improving the nutritional value of rice straw using microbial inoculants and some physical treatments to produce safe and cheap animal feeds.",

            "abstract": "Abstract: There is a current need to increase global livestock production in line with consumers’ preferences for more sustainable and ‘natural’ products. Organic farming is considered among the potential production systems and market strategies that could be employed to cope with this change. Animal nutrition is key, as it greatly influences feed efficiency, animal health, and sustainability. Under situations where animal health care is technically more challenging, due to limitations in the use of veterinary drugs (such as in organic farming), the importance of feed is even higher. However, the there is a lack of commercially available permitted feed ingredients and the range of feed additives on the market is limited. This is partially due to the fact that organic regulations are mainly followed to ensure that pure organic methods are used, instead of trying attain the core goal of complying with organic principles and contributing to the sustainability of the sector. For example, improved animal health and animal welfare through the use of non-organically certified feed additives is needed. This lack of availability, along with difficulties for the feed industry to become organic, affects the development of sustainability in the livestock sector (which should be the final objective of organic farming) in both already organic livestock/feed companies and those still producing under the conventional system. In this context, the presented work may be interesting to producers and policymakers, as it is aimed at providing a critical view of the relationship between the market and the needs of the livestock sector, the sustainability challenge, and organic farming regulations as applied to animal nutrition.",

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of supplementing roughage (rice straw) and concentrate with inoculants containing four fungal strains (Pleurotus ostreatus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trichoderma reesei and Trichoderma viride) and four bacterial strains (Paenibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus circulans and Bacillus subtilis), given separately or as a mixture, as a source of exogenous cellulolytic enzymes, on basic rumen parameters in vitro, including digestibility and methane production. A batch culture trial was used to select the best supplements, and a long-term rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) was used to evaluate the effects of P. chrysosporium, B. subtilis, and a 1 : 1 mixture of these two on dietary component digestibility and fermentation parameters. In the batch culture evaluation, there were significant increases in the organic matter (OM) digestibility, the total gas production expressed as ml/g of dry matter, the OM, the neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and the acid detergent fibre (ADF) of the supplemented rations, as compared to the control, excluding the rations supplemented with T. viride and B. circulans. In the RUSITEC, the ration supplemented with mixed inoculants showed significantly higher digestibility of crude protein, ether extract, NDF and ADF than did the ration supplemented with the P. chrysosporium and B. subtilis inoculants. It can be concluded that the simultaneous use of fungal and bacterial exogenous cellulases on rice straw roughage improves its digestibility, without negative effects on other rumen parameters.",

Receptors lacking GluR2 exhibit inward rectification and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) due to polyamine (PA)-dependent block and unblock, respectively. In this study, we tested whether rectification and PPF in immature, but not mature, pyramidal neurons depend not only on the absence of functional GluR2 but also on the level of endogenous PAs. Whole cell recordings were obtained from layer V pyramidal neurons of P12-P14 or P16-P20 rats in the presence or absence of spermine in the pipette (50 microM). Isolated minimal excitatory synaptic responses were obtained, and paired (20 Hz) stimuli were used to investigate the rectification index (RI) and paired-pulse ratio (PPR). Spermine and its synthetic enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), expression was examined using immunostaining and Western blot, respectively. At the immature stage (<P15) inclusion of intracellular spermine increased rectification and PPF for evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) but had little or no effect on either measure in more mature (P16-P20) pyramidal neurons. Depletion of PAs reduced rectification suggesting that endogenous PAs play a critical role in functional regulation of AMPARs. Spermine immunoreactivity and ODC expression in immature rat neocortex (<P15) were greater than more mature tissue by approximately 20 and 60%, respectively. These results provide further support for the idea that excitatory synapses on immature neocortical pyramidal neurons ubiquitously contain AMPA receptors lacking the GluR2 subunit and that the level of endogenous PAs plays an important role in modulating AMPAR-dependent neurotransmission.",

Polyamines are endogenous polyvalent cations that can act as agonists for the CaR, as shown by our current studies of human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells transfected with the human CaR. Cellular parameters altered by polyamines included cytosolic free Ca2+(Cai), inositol phosphate production, and the activity of a nonselective cation channel. Spermine stimulated Cai transients in CaR-transfected HEK cells, with a concentration producing a half-maximal response (EC50) of ∼500 μM in the presence of 0.5 mM Ca2+, whereas sustained increases in Cai had an EC50 of ∼200 μM. The order of potency was spermine > spermidine >> putrescine. Elevation of Cao shifted the EC50 for spermine sharply to the left, with substantial stimulation below 100 μM. Addition of subthreshold concentrations of spermine increased the sensitivity of CaR-expressing HEK cells to Cao. Parathyroid hormone secretion from bovine parathyroid cells was inhibited by 50% in the presence of 200 μM spermine, a response similar to that elicited by 2.0 mM Cao. These data suggest that polyamines could be effective agonists for the CaR, and several tissues, including the brain, may use the CaR as a target for the actions of spermine and other endogenous polycationic agonists.",

            "abstract": "Calcitonin (CT) secretion by parafollicular cells of the thyroid (C cells) is regulated by small changes in the concentration of extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]e). Elevation of [Ca2+]e elicits a rise in the C cell cytoplasmic calcium concentration and stimulates CT release. The molecular entity through which C cells detect changes in [Ca2+]e and modulate hormone secretion is unknown. Recently, an extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) complementary DNA was isolated from bovine parathyroid gland. To assess whether parathyroid cells and C cells use similar mechanisms to detect changes in ambient Ca2+, rat, human, and sheep C cells were examined for expression of the parathyroid CaR or a related receptor isoform. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis identified CaR transcripts in rat and human thyroid gland. Northern blot analysis demonstrated CaR messenger RNA (mRNA) in rat thyroid gland, a human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) isolate, and a highly enriched preparation of sheep C cells. Rat MTC 44-2 cells, a cell line responsive to changes in [Ca2+]e, express abundant levels of CaR mRNA. Human TT cells, a C cell line lacking the extracellular calcium-sensing function, have undetectable levels of CaR mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Western blot analysis, using antiserum specific to the parathyroid CaR, detected CaR protein in rMTC 44-2, but not TT cells. Immunostaining of both dispersed sheep C cells and rat thyroid gland sections identified C cell-specific expression of the CaR protein, and in situ hybridization analysis confirmed the C cell-specific expression of CaR mRNA in the intact rat thyroid. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the rMTC 44-2 CaR transcripts was found to encode the same CaR protein as that expressed in the parathyroid and kidney. The results demonstrate that C cells express the same extracellular calcium-sensing receptor that is found in parathyroid and kidney, and the presence of this receptor protein in C cell lines correlates with the extracellular calcium-sensing function. This CaR is likely to represent the primary molecular entity through which C cells detect changes in [Ca2+]e and control CT release, suggesting that activation of the same receptor can either stimulate or inhibit hormone secretion in different cell types.",

The CaR is expressed on the chief cells of the parathyroid gland and is responsible for controlling the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH acts on several organs including the bone, kidney, and intestine to tightly regulate the concentration of serum calcium. Substances other than calcium that activate the CaR are referred to as calcimimetics. Calcimimetics that bind to the CaR as agonists are referred to as type I. Type II calcimimetics bind to a site that is distinct from the physiological ligand and function as positive allosteric modulators of the CaR. Type II calcimimetics amplify the sensitivity of the CaR to serum calcium and are thus able to lower the concentration of serum PTH. Calcimimetics are being pursued as therapeutics for the treatment of disorders that are characterized by elevated levels of PTH such as primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism (primary HPT and secondary HPT). In this review, we provide an overview of key results in the discovery of cinacalcet HCl (Sensipar in the US, Mimpara in Europe). In addition, other recently disclosed type II calcimimetics are discussed.",

In a large placebo-controlled trial in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, strontium ranelate reduced vertebral fracture risk by 33% over 4 years, confirming the role of strontium ranelate as an effective long-term treatment in osteoporosis.IntroductionOsteoporotic vertebral fractures are associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and loss of quality-of-life (QoL). Strontium ranelate (2 g/day) was shown to prevent bone loss, increase bone strength, and reduce vertebral and peripheral fractures. The preplanned aim of this study was to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of strontium ranelate.MethodsA total of 1,649 postmenopausal osteoporotic women were randomized to strontium ranelate or placebo for 4 years, followed by a 1-year treatment-switch period for half of the patients. Primary efficacy criterion was incidence of patients with new vertebral fractures over 4 years. Lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) and QoL were also evaluated.ResultsOver 4 years, risk of vertebral fracture was reduced by 33% with strontium ranelate (risk reduction = 0.67, p < 0.001). Among patients with two or more prevalent vertebral fractures, risk reduction was 36% (p < 0.001). QoL, assessed by the QUALIOST®, was significantly better (p = 0.025), and patients without back pain were greater (p = 0.005) with strontium ranelate than placebo over 4 years. Lumbar BMD increased over 5 years in patients who continued with strontium ranelate, while it decreased in patients who switched to placebo. Emergent adverse events were similar between groups.ConclusionIn this 4- and 5-year study, strontium ranelate is an effective and safe treatment for long-term treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.",

In the present studies, we document that the CaR is activated not only by extracellular calcium ions but also by amino acids, establishing its capacity to sense nutrients of two totally different classes. l-Amino acids, especially aromatic amino acids, including l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan, stereoselectively mobilized Ca(2+) ions in the presence of the CaR agonists, Ca(2+)(o), gadolinium (Gd(3+)(o)), and spermine in fura-2-loaded human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells stably transfected with the human CaR. l-amino acid-dependent effects were observed above, but not below, a threshold level of Ca(2+)(o) of approximately 1.0 mM. l-Amino acids, particularly aromatic amino acids, also stereoselectively enhanced the sensitivity of the CaR to its agonists, Ca(2+)(o) and spermine. Branched-chain amino acids were almost inactive, and charged amino acids, including arginine and lysine, were much less effective than aromatic and other amino acids. l-amino acid mixtures emulating the amino acid composition of fasting human plasma reproduced the effects of high concentrations of individual l-amino acids on Ca(2+) mobilization and enhanced the sensitivity of the CaR to Ca(2+)(o). The data presented herein identify the CaR as a molecular target for aromatic and other l-amino acids. Thus, the CaR can integrate signals arising from distinct classes of nutrients: mineral ions and amino acids. The actions of l-amino acids on the CaR may provide explanations for several long recognized but poorly understood actions of dietary protein on calcium metabolism.",

            "abstract": "To define the primary effects of aluminum on bone in the mammalian species, we examined the dose/time-dependent actions of aluminum in normal beagles. Administration of low dose aluminum (0.75 mg/kg) significantly elevated the serum aluminum (151.7 +/- 19.9 micrograms/liter) compared with that in controls (4.2 +/- 1.35 micrograms/liter) but did not alter the calcium, creatinine, or parathyroid hormone. After 8 wk of therapy, bone biopsies displayed reduced bone resorption (2.6 +/- 0.63 vs. 4.5 +/- 0.39%) and osteoblast covered bone surfaces (2.02 +/- 0.51 vs. 7.64 +/- 1.86%), which was indicative of low turnover. In contrast, prolonged treatment resulted in increased bone volume and trabecular number (38.9 +/- 1.35 vs. 25.2 +/- 2.56% and 3.56 +/- 0.23 vs. 2.88 +/- 0.11/mm) which was consistent with uncoupled bone formation. Administration of higher doses of aluminum (1.20 mg/kg) increased the serum aluminum further (1242.3 +/- 259.8 micrograms/liter) but did not affect calcium, creatinine, or parathyroid hormone. However, after 8 wk of treatment, bone biopsies displayed changes similar to those after long-term, low-dose therapy. In this regard, an increased trabecular number (3.41 +/- 0.18/mm) and bone volume (36.5 +/- 2.38%) again provided evidence of uncoupled bone formation. In contrast, in this instance poorly mineralized woven bone contributed to the enhanced bone volume. High-dose treatment for 16 wk further enhanced bone volume (50.4 +/- 4.61%) and trabecular number (3.90 +/- 0.5/mm). These observations illustrate that aluminum may stimulate uncoupled bone formation and induce a positive bone balance. This enhancement of bone histogenesis contrasts with the effects of pharmacologic agents that alter the function of existing bone remodeling units.",

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer almost exclusively metastasizes to skeletal sites, indicating that the bone provides a favorable microenvironment for its localization and progression. A natural yet understudied factor in bone that could facilitate tumor localization is elevated extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o). The present study found that elevated [Ca2+]o (2.5 mmol/L) enhanced proliferation of skeletal metastatic prostate cell lines (PC-3 and C4-2B), but not the nonskeletal metastatic, epithelial-derived prostate cell line LNCaP. The proliferative effect of elevated [Ca2+]o was associated with higher expression of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor that is the predominant cell-surface sensor for [Ca2+]o. Knockdown of the CaSR via RNA interference reduced cell proliferation in vitro and metastatic progression in vivo. CaSR signaling in PC-3 cells was evaluated by measuring the elevated [Ca2+]o-dependent inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation, induced by either prostaglandin E2 or forskolin. Elevated [Ca2+]o stabilized expression of cyclin D1, a protein required for cell cycle transition. Furthermore, elevated [Ca2+]o triggered activation of the Akt signaling pathway and enhanced PC-3 cell attachment. Both pertussis toxin (a G-protein inhibitor) and LY294002 (an inhibitor of Akt signaling) reduced cell attachment. These data suggest that elevated [Ca2+]o following increased bone remodeling could facilitate metastatic localization of prostate cancer via the CaSR and the Akt signaling pathway. Taken together, [Ca2+]o is a candidate mediator of prostate cancer bone metastasis.",

Allosteric modulation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) by calcimimetics inhibits VC in animal models of advanced CKD. Here, we investigated the expression of the CaR in the vasculature and tested the ability of calcimimetics to prevent vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification in vitro.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nImmunohistochemical staining demonstrated that CaR protein is present in VSMC in normal, non-calcified human arteries. In contrast, low levels of CaR immunoreactivity were detected in atherosclerotic, calcified arteries. Immunfluorescence and immunoblotting revealed that CaR protein was also expressed by human and bovine VSMC in vitro. Acute stimulation of VSMC with increased Ca2+ stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, suggesting that the VSMC CaR is functional. VSMC CaR expression decreased when these cells deposited a mineralized matrix or following 24 h incubation in mineralization medium with increased (i.e. 1.8 or 2.5 mM) Ca2+. Culturing VSMC in mineralization medium containing 1.8 and 2.5 mM Ca2+ or with the membrane-impermeant CaR agonist Gd3+ enhanced mineral deposition compared with that observed in 1.2 mM Ca2+. Over-expression of dominant-negative (R185Q) CaR enhanced, whereas the calcimimetic R-568 attenuated, VSMC mineral deposition.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results demonstrate that: (i) VSMCs express a functional CaR; (ii) a reduction in CaR expression is associated with increased mineralization in vivo and in vitro; (iii) calcimimetics decrease mineral deposition by VSMC. These data suggest that calcimimetics may inhibit the development of VC in CKD patients.",

            "abstract": "Plasma calcium concentration is maintained within a narrow range (8.5-10.5 mg/dL) by the coordinated action of parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25(OH)2D3, calcitonin, and ionized calcium (iCa2+) itself. The kidney plays a key role in this process by the fine regulation of calcium excretion. More than 95% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed along the renal tubules. In the proximal tubules, 60% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed by passive mechanisms. In the thick ascending limb, 15% of calcium is reabsorbed by paracellular diffusion through paracellin-1 (claudin-16). The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) in the basolateral membrane of the thick ascending limb senses the change in iCa2+ and inhibits calcium reabsorption independent to PTH and 1,25(OH)2D3. The fine regulation of calcium excretion occurs in the distal convoluted tubules and connecting tubules despite the fact that only 10-15% of filtered calcium is reabsorbed there. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) and 6 (TRPV6) in the apical membrane act as the main portal of entry, calbindin-D28K delivers Ca2+ in the cytoplasm, and then Na2+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase in the basolateral membrane serve as an exit. In the cortical collecting duct, TRPV6 is expressed, but the role might be negligible. In addition to PTH and 1,25(OH)2D3, acid-base disturbance, diuretics, and estrogen affect on these calcium channels. Recently, klotho and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) are suggested as new players in the calcium metabolism. Klotho is exclusively expressed in the kidney and co-localized with TRPV5, NCX1, and calbindin-D28K. Klotho increases calcium reabsorption through trafficking of TRPV5 to the plasma membrane, and also converts FGF receptor to the specific FGF23 receptor. FGF23:klotho complex bound to FGF receptor inhibits 1α-hydroxylase of vitamin D, and contributes to calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion in the kidney.",

As such, alternative therapeutic approaches to managing excess PTH secretion are needed. Calcimimetic agents directly inhibit PTH secretion by activating the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid glands, but clinical experience with them is limited. Fifty-two hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism were given single orally administered doses of the calcimimetic agent AMG 073 ranging from 5 to 100 mg, or placebo. Plasma PTH levels decreased 2 h after 25-, 50-, 75-, or 100-mg doses, falling by a maximum of 43 +/- 29%, 40 +/- 36%, 54 +/- 28%, or 55 +/- 39%, respectively. Plasma PTH levels decreased in all patients given doses of > or =25 mg but did not change in those who received placebo. In patients treated with daily doses of 25 or 50 mg of AMG 073 for 8 d, plasma PTH levels declined for the first 3 to 4 d and remained below baseline values after 8 d of treatment. Serum calcium concentrations also decreased by 5 to 10% from pretreatment levels in patients given 50 mg of AMG 073 for 8 d, but values were unchanged in those who received lower doses. Serum phosphorus levels and values for the calcium-phosphorus ion product both decreased after treatment with AMG 073. Thus, 8 d of treatment with AMG 073 effectively lowers plasma PTH levels and improves several disturbances in mineral metabolism that have been associated with soft tissue and vascular calcification and with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with end-stage renal disease.",

SHPT is a progressive disease often requiring long-term therapy to control parathyroid hormone (PTH) and mineral imbalances. Vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders, used as traditional therapies to lower PTH and phosphorus, may provide inadequate long-term control for many dialysis patients. Cinacalcet, by simultaneously lowering PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and calcium-phosphorus levels, may maintain PTH and mineral balance in these individuals. However, as with traditional therapies, long-term data are limited. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENT: Dialysis subjects from at least one of five lead-in studies (double-blind placebo-controlled, including one extension trial) completing up to 52 wk of either cinacalcet or placebo were eligible for this open-label extension study, including an 8-wk dose titration (initiated at 30 mg/d), followed by 24-wk maintenance and up to 132 wk of follow-up. Final efficacy analysis was at week 180.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThree hundred thirty-four of 589 enrolled subjects received cinacalcet from the beginning of the lead-in study. Weekly median PTH values were < or =300 pg/ml (weeks 16 through 180) and median CaxP values were < or =55 mg(2)/dl(2) (weeks 4 through 180). Similar results were exhibited in the 255 subjects who initially received placebo. Among the patients exposed to cinacalcet from the beginning of the lead-in study, 3% of subjects exhibited treatment-related serious adverse events.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCinacalcet effectively maintained PTH, Ca and P reductions in dialysis subjects for up to 180 wk.",

The CaR is one of these broad-spectrum amino acid sensors that, along with several other members of the subgroup, also responds to extracellular Ca2+. In this mini-review, we consider evidence that the CaR is a sensor of aromatic amino acids, that it has broad-spectrum amino acid sensing properties, that it provides an amino acid binding site in its extracellular N-terminal Venus Fly Trap domain, and that amino acids have a physiological impact on systems in which the CaR is expressed.",

Some cells, such as osteoblasts in bone, retain responsiveness to extracellular calcium in CASR-deficient mice, consistent with the existence of another calcium-sensing receptor. We examined the calcium-sensing properties of GPRC6A, a newly identified member of this family. Alignment of GPRC6A with CASR revealed conservation of both calcium and calcimimetic binding sites. In addition, calcium, magnesium, strontium, aluminum, gadolinium, and the calcimimetic NPS 568 resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of GPRC6A overexpressed in human embryonic kidney cells 293 cells. Also, osteocalcin, a calcium-binding protein highly expressed in bone, dose-dependently stimulated GPRC6A activity in the presence of calcium but inhibited the calcium-dependent activation of CASR. Coexpression of β-arrestins 1 and 2, regulators of G-protein signaling RGS2 or RGS4, the RhoA inhibitor C3 toxin, the dominant negative Gαq-(305-359) minigene, and pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibited activation of GPRC6A by extracellular cations. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses showed that mouse GPRC6A is widely expressed in mouse tissues, including bone, calvaria, and the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1. These data suggest that in addition to sensing amino acids, GPRC6A is a cation-, calcimimetic-, and osteocalcin-sensing receptor and a candidate for mediating extracellular calcium-sensing responses in osteoblasts and possibly other tissues.",

In AtT-20 cells, Ca2+ and Ba2+, two CaSR agonists, induced a potent stimulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion. In the presence of 1.8 mM Ca2+, (+/-)NPS 568 led to a dose dependent secretion of ACTH with an EC50 of 0.3 microM and a maximal effect comparable to Ca2+. The similar potency of the calcimimetic on IP and ACTH responses and the sensitivity of these responses to extracellular Ca2+ indicate that the Ca2+-sensing receptor expressed in AtT-20 cells is implicated in ACTH release. These data further characterize the pharmacology of the Ca2+-sensing receptor and argue for a role for extracellular Ca2+ and CaSRs in controlling ACTH secretion, a hormone implicated in several types of stress.",

We recently identified another G protein-coupled receptor (BoPCaRI) from bovine parathyroid that responds to changes in extracellular Ca2+ within the millimolar range and provides a key mechanism for regulating the secretion of parathyroid hormone. Using an homology-based strategy, we now report the isolation of a cDNA encoding an extracellular Ca2+/polyvalent cation-sensing receptor (RaKCaR) from rat kidney. The predicted RaKCaR protein shares 92% identity with BoPCaR1 receptor and features a seven membrane-spanning domain, characteristic of the G protein-coupled receptors, which is preceded by a large hydrophilic extracellular NH2 terminus believed to be involved in cation binding. RaKCaR cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes responded to extracellular Ca2+, Mg2+, Gd3+, and neomycin with characteristic activation of inositol phospholipid-dependent, intracellular Ca(2+)-induced Cl- currents. In rat kidney, Northern analysis revealed RaKCaR transcripts of 4 and 7 kb, and in situ hybridization showed localization primarily in outer medulla and cortical medullary rays. Our results provide important insights into the molecular structure of an extracellular Ca2+/polyvalent cation-sensing receptor in rat kidney and provide another basis on which to understand the role of extracellular divalent cations in regulating kidney function in mineral metabolism.",

            "abstract": "Ca2+-sensing receptors (CaSRs) represent a class of receptors that respond to changes in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) and activate multiple signaling pathways. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of the role of Ca2+ in regulating CaSRs is the lack of adequate information about their Ca2+-binding locations, which is largely hindered by the lack of a solved three-dimensional structure and rapid off rates due to low Ca2+-binding affinities. In this paper, we have reported the identification of three potential Ca2+-binding sites in a modeled CaSR structure using computational algorithms based on the geometric description and surface electrostatic potentials. Mutation of the predicted ligand residues in the full-length CaSR caused abnormal responses to [Ca2+]o, similar to those observed with naturally occurring activating or inactivating mutations of the CaR, supporting the essential role of these predicted Ca2+-binding sites in the sensing capability of the CaSR. In addition, to probe the intrinsic Ca2+-binding properties of the predicted sequences, we engineered two predicted continuous Ca2+-binding sequences individually into a scaffold protein provided by a non-Ca2+-binding protein, CD2. We report herein the estimation of the metal-binding affinities of these predicted sites in the CaSR by monitoring aromatic-sensitized Tb3+ fluorescence energy transfer. Removing the predicted Ca2+-binding ligands resulted in the loss of or significantly weakened cation binding. The potential Ca2+-binding residues were shown to be involved in Ca2+/Ln3+ binding by high resolution NMR and site-directed mutagenesis, further validating our prediction of Ca2+-binding sites within the extracellular domain of the CaSR.",

AMG 073 represents a new class of compounds for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism known as calcimimetics, which reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) synthesis and secretion by increasing the sensitivity of the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) to extracellular calcium. The current study evaluates the efficacy and safety of AMG 073 when added to conventional treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Seventy-one hemodialysis patients with uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism, despite standard therapy with calcium, phosphate binders, and active vitamin D sterols, were treated in this 18-wk, dose-titration study with single daily oral doses of AMG 073/placebo up to 100 mg. Changes in plasma PTH, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and calcium x phosphorus levels were compared between AMG 073 and placebo groups. Mean PTH decreased by 33% in the AMG 073 patients compared with an increase of 3% in placebo patients (P = 0.001). A significantly greater proportion of AMG 073 patients (44%) had a mean PTH < or = 250 pg/ml compared with placebo patients (20%; P = 0.029). Also, a significantly greater proportion of AMG 073 patients (53%) had a decrease in PTH > or =30% compared with placebo patients (23%; P = 0.009). Calcium x phosphorus levels decreased by 7.9% in AMG 073 patients compared with an increase of 11.3% in placebo patients (P = 0.013). Adverse event rates were low and mostly mild to moderate in severity; however, the incidence of vomiting was higher in AMG 073 patients. In this study, the calcimimetic AMG 073 at doses up to 100 mg for 18 wk provided a safe and effective means to attain significant reductions in PTH and calcium x phosphorus levels in ESRD patients. AMG 073 represents a novel and promising therapy to improve the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism.",

Each treatment period lasted 6 months. Serum phosphorus was maintained in the range 1.5-2.0 mmol/l. During Al(OH)3 treatment bone mineral content (BMC) decreased by 11% per half-year (mean), but only by 3% per half-year during CaCO3 treatment (P less than 0.05). Comparing the CaCO3 and Al(OH)3 periods the following differences were found: serum calcium increased during CaCO3 treatment, PTH(1-84) decreased (79% of initial values during CaCO3 versus 196% during Al(OH)3, mean area under curve, P less than 0.05), osteocalcin decreased (89% versus 117%, P less than 0.01), alkaline phosphatase decreased (92% versus 116%, P less than 0.05), and aluminium decreased (56% versus 189%, P less than 0.05). 1,25(OH)2D3 remained unchanged in both periods. No increase in soft-tissue calcification was demonstrated on X-ray of the shoulders in any of the periods. Thus, CaCO3 treatment seems to slow down loss of bone mineral content, and using CaCO3 as phosphate binder may have a more beneficial effect on the progression of uraemic bone disease than Al(OH)3 due to the reduction of hyperparathyroidism and bone turnover.",

An increase in [Ca2+]o stimulates phospholipase C-mediated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and causes sinusoidal oscillations in [Ca2+]i. Conversely, aromatic amino acid-induced CaR activation does not stimulate phospholipase C but engages an unidentified signaling mechanism that promotes transient oscillations in [Ca2+]i. We show here that the [Ca2+]i oscillations stimulated by aromatic amino acids were selectively abolished by TRPC1 down-regulation using either a pool of small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) or two different individual siRNAs that targeted different coding regions of TRPC1. Furthermore, [Ca2+]i oscillations stimulated by aromatic amino acids were also abolished by inhibition of TRPC1 function with an antibody that binds the pore region of the channel. We also show that aromatic amino acid-stimulated [Ca2+]i oscillations can be prevented by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors or siRNA-mediated PKCα down-regulation and impaired by either calmodulin antagonists or by the expression of a dominant-negative calmodulin mutant. We propose a model for the generation of CaR-mediated transient [Ca2+]i oscillations that integrates its stimulation by aromatic amino acids with TRPC1 regulation by PKC and calmodulin.",

Since high Ca2+o is known to affect various physiological processes in lens epithelium both in health and in disease states (e.g., the formation of cataracts in hypocalcemic states), we investigated the expression and function of the CaR in these cells. By RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry the CaR is expressed in human lens epithelial cells in culture. In addition, the open state probability of a Ca(2+)-activated potassium (K+) channel with a conductance of 82 +/- 3 pS is significantly increased by elevating Ca2+o to 3.0 mM or by application of 100 microM neomycin, both effective CaR agonists. Therefore, our data suggest that human lens-epithelial cells express the CaR, which may be functionally linked to Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels and, perhaps, to other ion channels involved in ionic homeostasis in the lens.",

The extracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(o)/nutrient)-sensing receptor is expressed on both luminal and basolateral membranes of colonocytes, and, in other cell systems, this receptor has been shown to respond to polyamines. Thus, the Ca(2+)-sensing receptor could provide a mechanism for modulation of colonocyte function by dietary and systemic extracellular polyamines. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of polyamines, particularly spermine, and extracellular Ca(2+) on second messenger generation by, and on function of, rat distal colonic crypts.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCalcium-sensing receptor activation was assessed in colonic epithelial cells and intact crypts freshly isolated from distal colon by monitoring intracellular IP(3) and Ca(2+) accumulation using radioimmunoassay and Fluo-3 fluorometry, respectively. Interactions of extracellular Ca(2+) and spermine on regulation of both basal and forskolin-stimulated fluid transport were measured in crypts microperfused in vitro.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPolyamine (spermine > spermidine > putrescine)-mediated enhancement of intracellular D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) and Ca(2+) accumulation required extracellular Ca(2+), and the EC(50) for extracellular Ca(2+)-mediated activation of the calcium-sensing receptor was reduced by polyamines. Extracellular spermine modulated both basal and forskolin-stimulated fluid secretion in perfused colonic crypts, and the EC(50) for spermine-induced reduction in forskolin-stimulated fluid secretion was inversely dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(o)).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe interactions of extracellular Ca(2+) and polyamines on second messenger accumulation and fluid secretion support a role for the luminal and basolateral calcium-sensing receptors in mediating some of the effects of polyamines on distal colonic epithelial cells.",

In this study, we have investigated which of these disulfide linkages are essential for dimerization of the CaR and whether they are required for these functional interactions. Our results confirm the key roles of Cys129 and Cys131 in CaR dimerization. However, utilizing cross-linking of the CaR or immunoprecipitation of a non-FLAG-tagged CaR with a FLAG-tagged CaR using anti-FLAG antibody, we demonstrate that CaRs with or without these two cysteines form dimers on the cell surface to a similar extent. In addition, reconstitution of CaR-mediated signaling by cotransfection of two individually inactive mutant CaRs is nearly identical in the presence or absence of both Cys129 and Cys131, showing that covalent linkage of CaR dimers is not needed for functional interactions between CaR monomers. These findings suggest that the CaR has at least two distinct types of motifs mediating dimerization and functional interactions, i.e. covalent interactions involving intermolecular disulfide bonds and noncovalent, possibly hydrophobic, interactions.",

            "abstract": "In hypocalcaemia, elevated parathyroid hormone transitorily down-regulates the kidney vitamin D receptor, which returns to normal levels with the rise in serum extracellular calcium [Ca2+]e. In this study, we investigated the mechanism that underlies VDR increase in kidney in association with elevated [Ca2+]e. Examination of MAP kinase signals in a proximal tubule human kidney (HK-2G) epithelial cell line showed that treatment of [Ca2+]e in the culture medium elevated phosphorylation of both ERK and p38 MAPKs. Blockade of p38 phosphorylation with SB203580 or SB202190 in turn abolished [Ca2+]e-mediated VDR protein increase, while treatment with PD98059 and U0126, specifically blocked ERK phosphorylation, but had no effect on VDR stimulation by [Ca2+]e. Furthermore, SB203580 treatment potently repressed [Ca2+]e-mediated activation of VDR promoter. We also demonstrate that si-RNA knock down of p38α completely diminished high [Ca2+]e-mediated VDR induction. Direct CaSR involvement was demonstrated by using an si-RNA of CaSR that impeded [Ca2+]e-mediated induction of VDR. In conclusion, a high extracellular [Ca2+]e concentration in the physiological range is capable of directly increasing renal proximal VDR expression, and the induction mechanism requires activation of the CaSR and signal mediation by the p38α MAP kinase pathway.",

The Ca2+o-sensing receptor (CaR) originally cloned from bovine parathyroid is also present in multiple nephron segments involved in Ca2+o homeostasis as well as in other sites that are not, such as brain, lung, large and small intestine. The physiological relevance of the CaR has been established by identifying hyper- and hypocalcemic disorders resulting from CaR mutations: familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism result from inactivating CaR mutations, while an autosomal dominant form ofhypocalcemia is caused by activating mutations. In addition to sensing Ca2+o and Mg2+o abnormally (the latter suggesting the CaR acts as an Mg2+o-sensing receptor), persons with FHH have alterations in their handling of water, supporting a role for the CaR in integrating mineral ion and water metabolism. Drugs that activate the CaR ('calcimimetics') are currently undergoing clinical trials and will permit pharmacological manipulation of the receptor when it functions abnormally (e.g., in primary hyperparathyroidism).",

        "abstract": "Some foods are known to have flavours that cannot be explained by the five basic tastes alone, such as continuity, mouthfulness and thick flavour. It was demonstrated that these sensations are evoked by the addition of kokumi substances, flavour modifiers that have no taste themselves. However, their mode of action has been poorly understood. During a study on the perception of amino acids and peptides, it was found that glutathione (GSH) was one of the agonists of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). We have hypothesized that CaSR is involved in the perception of kokumi substances. We found that all CaSR agonists tested act as kokumi substances and that a positive correlation exists between the CaSR activity of γ-glutamyl peptides and kokumi intensity. Furthermore, the kokumi intensities of GSH and γ-Glu-Val-Gly, a potent kokumi peptide, were significantly reduced by the CaSR-specific antagonist, NPS-2143. These results suggest that CaSR is involved in the perception of kokumi substances. A potent kokumi peptide, γ-Glu-Val-Gly, enhanced sweetness, saltiness and umami when added to 3.3% sucrose, 0.9% NaCl and 0.5% MSG solutions, respectively. In addition, γ-Glu-Val-Gly enhanced the intensity of continuity, mouthfulness and thick flavour when added to chicken soup and reduced-fat cream. These results suggest that γ-Glu-Val-Gly is a potent kokumi peptide and would be useful for improving the flavour of food.",

            "abstract": "Recently, we reported that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a receptor for kokumi substances, which enhance the intensities of salty, sweet and umami tastes. Furthermore, we found that several γ-glutamyl peptides, which are CaSR agonists, are kokumi substances. In this study, we elucidated the receptor cells for kokumi substances, and their physiological properties. For this purpose, we used Calcium Green-1 loaded mouse taste cells in lingual tissue slices and confocal microscopy. Kokumi substances, applied focally around taste pores, induced an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a subset of taste cells. These responses were inhibited by pretreatment with the CaSR inhibitor, NPS2143. However, the kokumi substance-induced responses did not require extracellular Ca2+. CaSR-expressing taste cells are a different subset of cells from the T1R3-expressing umami or sweet taste receptor cells. These observations indicate that CaSR-expressing taste cells are the primary detectors of kokumi substances, and that they are an independent population from the influenced basic taste receptor cells, at least in the case of sweet and umami.",

Voltage-clamp and current-clamp data were obtained from a circumscribed region of the anterior rat lingual epithelium while simultaneously monitoring the afferent, stimulus-evoked, neural response from the same receptive field. 2. Chorda tympani (CT) responses at constant Na(+)-salt concentration were enhanced by submucosa negative voltage clamp and suppressed by positive voltage clamp. The complete CT response profile, including the time course of adaptation, was not uniquely determined by NaCl concentration alone. The response could be reproduced at different NaCl concentrations by applying a compensating voltage. 3. The form of the concentration and voltage dependence of the CT response indicates that the complete stimulus energy is the Na+ electrochemical potential difference across receptor cell apical membranes, and not Na+ concentration alone. This is the underlying principal behind the equivalence of chemical and electric taste for Na+ salts. 4. CT responses to sodium gluconate (25 and 200 mM) and 25 mM NaCl produced amiloride-insensitive components (AIC) of low magnitude. NaCl at 200 mM produced a significantly larger AIC. The AIC was voltage-clamp independent. The relative magnitude of the AIC was positively correlated with the transepithelial conductance of each salt. This suggests that the large AIC for 200 mM NaCl results from its relatively high permeability through the paracellular pathway. 5. Analysis of the CT response under voltage clamp revealed two anion effects on Na(+)-salt taste, both of which act through the paracellular shunt. 1) Anions modify the transepithelial potential (TP) across tight junctions and thereby modulate the cell receptor potential. This anion effect can be eliminated by voltage clamping the TP. 2) Sufficiently mobile anions facilitate electroneutral diffusion of Na+ salts through tight junctions. This effect is observed especially when Cl- is the anion and when the stimulus concentration favors NaCl influx, allowing Na+ to stimulate receptor cells from the submucosal side. Because the submucosal intercellular spaces are nearly isopotential regions, this effect is insensitive to voltage clamp of the TP. The large AIC associated with this anion effect is due to the low permeability of amiloride.",

For functional studies, an isolated lingual epithelium containing a single fungiform papilla was mounted with apical and basolateral sides isolated and perfused with nominally CO(2)/HCO(3)(-)-free physiological media (pH 7.4). The TRCs were monitored for changes in intracellular pH (pH(i)) and Na(+) ([Na(+)](i)) using fluorescence ratio imaging. At constant external pH, 1) removal of basolateral Na(+) reversibly decreased pH(i) and [Na(+)](i); 2) HOE642, a specific blocker, and amiloride, a nonspecific blocker of basolateral NHE-1, attenuated the decrease in pH(i) and [Na(+)](i); 3) exposure of TRCs to basolateral NH(4)Cl or sodium acetate pulses induced transient decreases in pH(i) that recovered spontaneously to baseline; 4) pH(i) recovery was inhibited by basolateral amiloride, 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)-amiloride (MIA), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), HOE642, and by Na(+) removal; 5) HOE642, MIA, EIPA, and amiloride inhibited pH(i) recovery with K(i) values of 0.23, 0.46, 0.84, and 29 microM, respectively; and 6) a decrease in apical or basolateral pH acidified TRC pH(i) and inhibited spontaneous pH(i) recovery.

            "abstract": "Taste buds were isolated from the fungiform papilla of the rat tongue and the receptor cells (TRCs) were patch clamped. Seals were obtained on the basolateral membrane of 281 TRCs, protruding from the intact taste buds or isolated by micro-dissection. In whole-cell configuration 72% of the cells had a TTX blockable transient Na inward current (mean peak amplitude 0.74 nA). All cells had outward K currents. Their activation was slower than for the Na current and a slow inactivation was also noticeable. The K currents were blocked by tetraethylammonium, Ba, and 4-aminopyridine, and were absent when the pipette contained Cs instead of K. With 100 mM Ba or 100 mM Ca in the bath, two types of inward current were observed. An L-type Ca current (ICaL) activated at - 20 mV had a mean peak amplitude of 440 pA and inactivated very slowly. At 3 mM Ca the activation threshold of ICaL was near -40 mV. A transient T-type current (ICaT) activated at -50 mV had an average peak amplitude of 53 pA and inactivated with a time constant of 36 ms at -30 mV. ICaL was blocked more efficiently by Cd and D600 than ICaT. ICaT was blocked by 0.2 mM Ni and half blocked by 200 microM amiloride. In whole-cell voltage clamp, Na-saccharin caused (in 34% of 55 cells tested) a decrease in outward K currents by 21%, which may be expected to depolarize the TRCs. Also, Na-saccharin caused some taste cells to fire action potentials (on-cell, 7 out of 24 cells; whole-cell, 2 out of 38 cells responding to saccharin) of amplitudes sufficient to activate ICaL. Thus the action potentials will cause Ca inflow, which may trigger release of transmitter.",

Experiments visualize carboxyseminaphthorhodofluor-1 (SNARF-1; a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye) in the extracellular fluid to measure extracellular pH within an intact epithelium. Lucifer yellow (LY; a pH-insensitive dye) is used to control for fidelity of the optical path. Light scatter from colonic tissue caused SNARF-1 or LY fluorescence to decrease 3% per micrometer focal distance into tissue at both 640- and 580-nm emission wavelengths. However, dual emission ratios of LY fluorescence were constant as a function of focal distance into tissue or in the presence of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). SCFA, known to cause changes in extracellular pH, cause maximal changes in crypt luminal pH at 10 microns from the crypt base. Maximal changes of pH in lamina propria occur higher along the crypt-to-surface axis than maximal changes in luminal pH. Lateral intercellular spaces between colonocytes are a separate microdomain in which pH is constant in absence vs. presence of SCFA and along the base-to-apex axis of colonocytes.",

These small-diameter neurons transduce signals of a chemical, mechanical, or thermal nature into action potentials and transmit this information to the central nervous system, ultimately eliciting a perception of pain or discomfort. Little is known about the proteins that detect noxious stimuli, especially those of a physical nature. Here we review recent advances in the molecular characterization of the capsaicin (vanilloid) receptor, an excitatory ion channel expressed by nociceptors, which contributes to the detection and integration of pain-producing chemical and thermal stimuli. The analysis of vanilloid receptor gene knockout mice confirms the involvement of this channel in pain sensation, as well as in hypersensitivity to noxious stimuli following tissue injury. At the same time, these studies demonstrate the existence of redundant mechanisms for the sensation of heat-evoked pain.",

Capsaicin selectively suppressed the responses to NaCl of the CT nerve fibers (N-fibers) that are sodium-specific (insensitive or poorly sensitive to potassium). Among the more broadly responsive, cation-sensitive fibers (E-fibers) there are two subtypes, both of which responded to capsaicin but in different ways ('enhanced' type and 'suppressed' type). In both N- and E-fibers, 5% ethanol (the vehicle for capsaicin) slightly reduced the response to 100 mM NaCl. The suppressive effect of capsaicin on the response of the N-type fibers to 100 mM NaCl was significantly stronger than the effect of 5% ethanol. The suppression lasted for at least 20 s after the simultaneous application of 100 p.p.m. capsaicin-100 nM NaCl. These results indicate that 100 p.p.m. capsaicin can modify the response of CT fibers to NaCl. The observed effect of capsaicin on gustatory fibers could be the net result of opposite suppressive and enhancing processes in the taste buds cells and excited intra- or extragemmal trigeminal nerve endings.",

Recent research has revealed that a remarkable diversity of cellular mechanisms are involved in taste stimulus reception. These mechanisms range from G protein-and second messenger-linked receptor systems to stimulus-gated and stimulus-admitting ion channels. Contrary to widely held ideas, new data show that some taste stimuli interact with receptive sites that are localized on both the apical and basolateral membranes of taste cells. Studies of taste system development in several species indicate that the transduction pathways for some stimuli are modulated significantly during the early postnatal period. In addition, recent investigations of adult peripheral gustatory system plasticity strongly suggest that the function of the Na+ sensing system can be modulated by circulating hormones, growth factors, or cytokines.",

The response of VR1 to capsaicin or noxious heat is dynamically potentiated by extracellular protons within a pH range encountered during tissue acidosis, such as that associated with arthritis, infarction, tumor growth, and other forms of injury. A molecular determinant for this important physiological activity was localized to an extracellular Glu residue (E600) in the region linking the fifth transmembrane domain with the putative pore-forming region of the channel. We suggest that this residue serves as a key regulatory site of the receptor by setting sensitivity to other noxious stimuli in response to changes in extracellular proton concentration. We also demonstrate that protons, vanilloids, and heat promote channel opening through distinct pathways, because mutations at a second site (E648) selectively abrogate proton-evoked channel activation without diminishing responses to other noxious stimuli. Our findings provide molecular evidence for stimulus-specific steps in VR1 activation and offer strategies for the development of novel analgesic agents.",

The cellular mechanisms that mediate this phenomenon are not known. This \"anion paradox\" has been resolved by considering the field potential that is generated by restricted electrodiffusion of the anion through paracellular shunts between taste-bud cells. Neural responses to sodium chloride, sodium acetate, and sodium gluconate were studied while the field potential was voltage-clamped. Clamping at electronegative values eliminated the anion effect, whereas clamping at electropositive potentials exaggerated it. Thus, field potentials across the lingual epithelium modulate taste reception, indicating that the functional unit of taste reception includes the taste cell and its paracellular microenvironment.",

The electronic tongue response data were then analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant factor analysis (DFA) method. It was found that the umami response value of the electronic tongue and the flavor enhancer concentration showed a semi‐logarithmic function. Moreover, the PCA and DFA could successfully distinguish the variety and concentration of flavor enhancer. The umami intensities were also assessed by human sensory and showed consistency with those of electronic tongue tests. This implies the electronic tongue has a great potential as an alternative for biological tongue on sensing intensity of flavor enhancer.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms underlying gustatory detection of dietary sodium is important for the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Here, we show that Angiotensin II (AngII), a major mediator of body fluid and sodium homeostasis, modulates salty and sweet taste sensitivities, and that this modulation critically influences ingestive behaviors in mice. Gustatory nerve recording demonstrated that AngII suppressed amiloride-sensitive taste responses to NaCl. Surprisingly, AngII also enhanced nerve responses to sweeteners, but had no effect on responses to KCl, sour, bitter, or umami tastants. These effects of AngII on nerve responses were blocked by the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist CV11974. In behavioral tests, CV11974 treatment reduced the stimulated high licking rate to NaCl and sweeteners in water-restricted mice with elevated plasma AngII levels. In taste cells AT1 proteins were coexpressed with αENaC (epithelial sodium channel α-subunit, an amiloride-sensitive salt taste receptor) or T1r3 (a sweet taste receptor component). These results suggest that the taste organ is a peripheral target of AngII. The specific reduction of amiloride-sensitive salt taste sensitivity by AngII may contribute to increased sodium intake. Furthermore, AngII may contribute to increased energy intake by enhancing sweet responses. The linkage between salty and sweet preferences via AngII signaling may optimize sodium and calorie intakes.",

We recently demonstrated that depletion-induced salt appetite was attenuated by selective blockade of peripheral ANG II synthesis with an intravenous dose of converting enzyme inhibitor [captopril (Cap)] that does not block the synthesis of ANG II inside the blood brain barrier. We now show that intravenous ANG II at 30 ng/min rapidly reestablishes salt appetite in Cap-blocked rats. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of unblocked, sodium-depleted rats was normal, but Cap-blocked, depleted rats had low MAP. An intravenous infusion of ANG II in Cap-blocked rats brought MAP into the normal range and elicited water and salt drinking within 90 min. Phenylephrine also normalized MAP but failed to elicit fluid intake in Cap-blocked, sodium-deficient rats. Sodium and water balances tended to be more positive during ANG II than during phenylephrine infusions. Thus circulating ANG II may stimulate both thirst and salt appetite by a direct action on the brain and not by causing natriuresis or by raising the blood pressure.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundCongenital aniridia caused by heterozygousity at the PAX6 locus is associated with ocular surface disease including keratopathy. It is not clear whether the keratopathy is a direct result of reduced PAX6 gene dosage in the cornea itself, or due to recurrent corneal trauma secondary to defects such as dry eye caused by loss of PAX6 in other tissues. We investigated the hypothesis that reducing Pax6 gene dosage leads to corneal wound-healing defects. and assayed the immediate molecular responses to wounding in wild-type and mutant corneal epithelial cells.ResultsPax6+/- mouse corneal epithelia exhibited a 2-hour delay in their response to wounding, but subsequently the cells migrated normally to repair the wound. Both Pax6+/+ and Pax6+/- epithelia activated immediate wound-induced waves of intracellular calcium signaling. However, the intensity and speed of propagation of the calcium wave, mediated by release from intracellular stores, was reduced in Pax6+/- cells. Initiation and propagation of the calcium wave could be largely decoupled, and both phases of the calcium wave responses were required for wound healing. Wounded cells phosphorylated the extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2). ERK1/2 activation was shown to be required for rapid initiation of wound healing, but had only a minor effect on the rate of cell migration in a healing epithelial sheet. Addition of exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF) to wounded Pax6+/- cells restored the calcium wave, increased ERK1/2 activation and restored the immediate healing response to wild-type levels.ConclusionThe study links Pax6 deficiency to a previously overlooked wound-healing delay. It demonstrates that defective calcium signaling in Pax6+/- cells underlies this delay, and shows that it can be pharmacologically corrected. ERK1/2 phosphorylation is required for the rapid initiation of wound healing. A model is presented whereby minor abrasions, which are quickly healed in normal corneas, transiently persist in aniridic patients, compromising the corneal stroma.",

We have employed RT-PCR to identify the AC isoforms present in taste cells and found that AC 4, 6, and 8 are expressed as mRNAs in taste tissue. These proteins are also expressed in a subset of taste cells as revealed by immunohistochemistry. Alterations of cAMP concentrations are associated with transduction of taste stimuli of several classes. The involvement of particular ACs in this modulation has not been investigated. We demonstrate that glutamate, which is a potent stimulus eliciting a taste quality termed umami, causes a decrease in cAMP in forskolin-treated taste cells. The potentiation of this response by inosine monophosphate, the lack of response to d-glutamate, and the lack of response to umami stimuli in nonsensory lingual epithelium all suggest that the cAMP modulation represents umami taste transduction. Because cAMP downregulation via ACs can be mediated through Galpha(i) proteins, we examined the colocalization of the detected ACs with Galpha(i) proteins and found that 66% of AC8 immunopositive taste cells are also positive for gustducin, a taste-specific Galpha(i) protein. Whether AC8 is directly involved in signal transduction of umami taste remains to be established.",

It is unclear for example, if activation of type II cells leads to direct activation of the gustatory nerves, or whether the information is relayed through type III cells. To determine how WGA produced in T1r3-expressing taste cells is transported into gustatory neurons, transgenic mice expressing WGA-IRES-GFP driven by the T1r3 promoter were generated.ResultsImmunohistochemistry showed co-expression of WGA, GFP and endogenous T1r3 in the taste bud cells of transgenic mice: the only taste cells immunoreactive for WGA were the T1r3-expressing cells. The WGA antibody also stained intragemmal nerves. WGA, but not GFP immunoreactivity was found in the geniculate and petrosal ganglia of transgenic mice, indicating that WGA was transported across synapses. WGA immunoreactivity was also found in the trigeminal ganglion, suggesting that T1r3-expressing cells make synapses with trigeminal neurons. In the medulla, WGA was detected in the nucleus of the solitary tract but also in the nucleus ambiguus, the vestibular nucleus, the trigeminal nucleus and in the gigantocellular reticular nucleus. WGA was not detected in the parabrachial nucleus, or the gustatory cortex.ConclusionThese results show the usefulness of genetically encoded WGA as a tracer for the first and second order neurons that innervate a subset of taste cells, but not for higher order neurons, and demonstrate that the main route of output from type II taste cells is the gustatory neuron, not the type III cells.",

In contrast, the IXth nerve innervating the posterior part of the tongue has almost exclusively the AI type. This relative abundance of the AS and AI types of fibers was not altered by cross-regeneration of the two gustatory nerves into the reverse tongue regions.

An administration of leptin into lean mice suppressed responses of peripheral taste nerves (chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal) to sweet substances (sucrose and saccharin) without affecting responses to sour, salty, and bitter substances. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of activities of taste receptor cells isolated from circumvallate papillae (innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve) demonstrated that leptin activated outward K(+) currents, which resulted in hyperpolarization of taste cells. The db/db mouse with impaired leptin receptors showed no such leptin suppression. Taste tissue (circumvallate papilla) of lean mice expressed leptin-receptor mRNA and some of the taste cells exhibited immunoreactivities to antibodies of the leptin receptor. Taken together, these observations suggest that the taste organ is a peripheral target for leptin, and that leptin may be a sweet-sensing modulator (suppressor) that may take part in regulation of food intake. Defects in this leptin suppression system in db/db mice may lead to their enhanced peripheral neural responses and enhanced behavioral preferences for sweet substances.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism of increased adrenal sensitivity to angiotensin II during the aldosterone response to sodium restriction was investigated in the rat. Sodium restriction for 36 hr markedly increased the aldosterone-stimulating effect of low-dose (1 ng/min) infusion of angiotensin II and caused enhanced binding of (125)I-labeled angiotensin II to the zona glomerulosa in vivo. Conversely, in vivo binding of (125)I-labeled angiotensin II was significantly decreased after 36 hr of high-sodium intake. In isolated glomerulosa cells, the increased binding of angiotensin II after sodium restriction was shown to result from a significant increase in receptor affinity (+80%) and a smaller increase in receptor concentration (+25%). The corresponding aldosterone responses in dispersed cells showed an increase in sensitivity to angiotensin II, commensurate with the increased receptor affinity. More prolonged sodium restriction (4 days) caused a further increase in angiotensin receptor concentration (+70%) and maximal aldosterone response (+50%), whereas the binding affinity of adrenal receptors and the sensitivity of the in vitro aldosterone response had returned to normal. During sodium loading for 36 hr and 4 days, the converse effects on adrenal angiotensin II receptors and aldosterone production were observed. Also, in contrast to the consistent increase in angiotensin II receptors in the adrenal glands of sodium-restricted animals, the angiotensin II binding capacity of uterine smooth muscle was decreased by 40% after 7 days of sodium restriction.The rapid regulation of receptor affinity and concentration during changes in sodium intake provides a basis for the dynamic modulation of aldosterone responses by dietary sodium content. During sodium restriction, the sequential changes in receptor affinity and concentration account for the enhanced binding and steroidogenic actions of angiotensin II in vivo and in vitro. These receptor changes, and the converse effects of sodium loading, serve as a local regulatory mechanism in the physiological control of adrenal sensitivity and aldosterone secretion. The opposite finding in smooth muscle-that sodium restriction decreases the concentration of angiotensin II receptors-is consistent with the divergent effects of changing sodium balance upon vascular and adrenal responses to angiotensin II.",

In vivo microperfusion was performed in rat PCT with measurements of bicarbonate absorption and of tubular fluid cAMP delivery, as a reflection of intracellular cAMP. Intravenous angiotensin II potently increased S1 PCT bicarbonate absorption (348 +/- 11 to 588 +/- 8 peq/min.min, P less than 0.001) and decreased tubular fluid cAMP (18 +/- 2 to 12 +/- 2 fmol/mm.min, P less than 0.05). Parathyroid hormone had the expected opposite effects, which were additive to those of angiotensin II. Over a wide range of hormonal activities, there was an excellent inverse relationship between hormonally modulated bicarbonate absorption and cAMP delivery. Pertussis toxin pretreatment significantly attenuated (by 35-45%) the angiotensin-induced increase in bicarbonate absorption and decrease in cAMP delivery, indicating Gi-protein intermediation. Luminal dibutyryl cAMP abolished the transport response to angiotensin II. In conclusion, these in vivo results suggest angiotensin II stimulates bicarbonate absorption in the S1 PCT by a G1-mediated depression in intracellular cAMP.",

However, the regional hemodynamic mechanisms underlying the hypotensive effect of AT1 receptor antagonists in 2K1C rats under dynamic conditions have not been documented. Therefore, in the present study we determined the hemodynamic profile of the AT1 receptor antagonist CV-11974 in conscious 2K1C rats and sham-operated control rats. Approximately 4 weeks after clipping, rats underwent a further two-stage operation for implantation of Doppler flow probes on the contralateral (left) renal artery, superior mesenteric artery, and distal aorta as well as for the implantation of intravascular catheters. At least 24 hours after the last operation continuous recordings were made of mean arterial pressure; heart rate; and renal, mesenteric, and hindquarters flows and conductances (Doppler shift/mean arterial pressure) in response to three doses of CV-11974 (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/kg i.v.). CV-11974 caused a small hypotensive effect (decrease of approximately 15 mm Hg) in the sham group, but regional flows and vascular conductances did not change. By contrast, in 2K1C rats CV-11974 caused dose-dependent hypotension that was maximal (-19 +/- 6, -41 +/- 4, and -51 +/- 8 mm Hg, respectively) after 6 hours. These changes were associated with generalized vasodilatation (increased conductance) in all three vascular beds, although there were subtle differences with the different CV-11974 doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. One group ingested daily 95 mL of the sour milk for 8 wk, and the other group ingested the same amount of artificially acidified milk as a placebo for 8 wk. In the sour-milk group, systolic blood pressure decreased significantly 4 and 8 wk after ingestion, by 9.4 +/- 3.6 mm Hg (mean+/- SE, P < 0.05) and 14.1 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (P < 0.01), respectively. The diastolic blood pressure also decreased significantly, by 6.9 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P < 0.01), by 8 wk after ingestion of the sour milk began. No significant changes in blood pressure were observed in the placebo group. The decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the sour-milk group tended to be greater than in the placebo group. No marked changes were observed in other indexes, including pulse rate, body weight, and blood serum variables in both groups.",

            "abstract": "Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.",

In view of the increasing evidence that angiotensin II, which can be generated by endothelial cells, has actions outside the traditional renin-angiotensin system, we tested the effect of angiotensin II on bone resorption Angiotensin II showed no effect either on osteoclast formation or on bone resorption by isolated osteoclasts. However, in co-cultures of osteoclasts with calvarial or MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, and in osteoclastic cultures co-cultured with other bone cells obtained by prolonged sedimentation, angiotensin II stimulated bone resorption to a similar degree to that observed with 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3. Stimulation of resorption was noted at concentrations of 10(-7) M and above. We found that angiotensin I also stimulated bone resorption in co-cultures of osteoclasts with osteoblastic cells, and that this action was inhibited by inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. These results identify angiotensin I and II as potent stimulators of osteoclastic bone resorption, and raise the possibility that bone might contain a tissue-renin-angiotensin system that might play a role in the regulation of bone resorption.",

            "abstract": "Biologically active peptides derived from milk proteins are inactive within the sequence of the precursor proteins but can be released by enzymatic proteolysis. Based on structure-activity studies, peptides with a defined bioactivity show common structural features. Moreover, many milk protein-derived peptides reveal multifunctional bioactivities. Bioactive peptide fragments originating from milk proteins should be taken into account as potential modulators of various regulatory processes in the body. Opioid peptides are opioid receptor ligands with agonistic or antagonistic activities. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides can exert an antihypertensive effect. Immunomodulating casein peptides have been found to stimulate the proliferation of human lymphocytes and the phagocytic activities of macrophages. Antimicrobial peptides have been shown to kill sensitive microorganisms. Antithrombotic peptides inhibit the fibrinogen binding to a specific receptor region on the platelet surface and also inhibit aggregation of platelets. Casein phosphopeptides can form soluble organophosphate salts and may function as carriers for different minerals, especially calcium. In relation to their mode of action, bioactive peptides may reach target sites (e.g., receptors, enzymes) at the luminal side of the intestinal tract or after absorption, in peripheral organs. The physiological significance of bioactive peptides as exogenous regulatory substances is not yet fully understood. Nevertheless, several bioactive peptides derived from milk proteins have been shown to exert beneficial physiological effects. Milk-derived peptides were already produced on an industrial scale and as a consequence these peptides have been considered for application both as dietary supplements in \"functional foods\" and as drugs.",

        "abstract": "High dietary sodium intake is a risk factor for hypertension, and heart rate variability (HRV) is decreased in hypertension. Effects of dietary sodium intake on HRV of normotensive persons have not, however, been investigated to date. The present study examined effects of low and high sodium diets on blood pressure, heart rate, and HRV in 36 healthy, normotensive women, ages 40-70. Each was placed on a low sodium diet for 6 days followed by a high sodium diet for 6 days. The high salt diet increased mean systolic blood pressure, decreased heart rate, and increased high frequency HRV (HF). Cardiac vagal tone, estimated at baseline from heart period and a time domain estimate of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, was higher in salt-sensitive than salt-insensitive subjects. The finding of increased vagal tone in normotensive persons on high salt intake indicates that dietary sodium status should be considered in behavioral studies of HRV.",

            "abstract": "The effect of different mental states on autonomic modulation of the cardiovascular system was assessed in healthy, normotensive men (n = 18) and women (n = 12). Heart rate variability (HRV), systolic blood pressure variability (BPV) and arterial baroreflex function were assessed during 4 tests at rest ((10 min + 5 min recovery) x 4): (1) Control (spontaneous breathing, (SB) (2) Mental distraction (SB + word puzzle) (3) Conscious control of breathing (paced at SB rate) and (4) Mental stress (SB + computer quiz). There were no significant gender differences in the responses to the interventions in terms of arterial (spontaneous) baroreflex (SPBX) control of HR, and indices of time and frequency domains of HRV and BPV, with the exception of the sympathetic indicator of HRV (low frequency power/total power; P < 0.01) which was lower in women during control and mental stress tests. Conscious control of breathing at SB did not alter HRV, BPV or SPBX in either men or women. Mental distraction and mental stress led to decreases in indices of time and frequency domains of HRV and BPV in all subjects, as well as increases in HR during distraction and in systolic BP during stress. These findings suggest that in studies of cardiovascular control: (1) Paced breathing at SB can be used for individuals with irregular breathing patterns (2) The extent of mental stress achieved is intervention-specific and for the most part, independent of gender and (3) Resting assessment of HRV, BPV and SPBX can be made by having subjects sit quietly without interventions in a controlled laboratory setting.",

HRV indices, determined in either the time or frequency domain, are closely related and reflect parasympathetic, mixed sympathetic, and parasympathetic and circadian rhythms. In population studies, decreased HRV has had predictive value for mortality among healthy adults. It is a well-established risk factor for arrhythmic events and mortality among post-myocardial-infarction patients but has only moderate sensitivity and specificity. Decreased HRV has had mixed predictive success in congestive heart failure. Reduced HRV identifies diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy. HRV in combination with other risk stratifiers, e.g. ejection fraction, can identify cardiac patients at especially high risk of mortality. Many but not all interventions associated with increased HRV are also associated with better survival rates.",

Human taste perception may be categorized according to four well-known and widely accepted descriptors, sweet, bitter, salty and sour (corresponding to particular taste qualities or modalities), and two more controversial qualities: fat and amino acid taste. The ability to identify sweet-tasting foodstuffs is particularly important as it provides us and other vertebrates with a means to seek out needed carbohydrates with high nutritive value. The perception of bitter, on the other hand, is essential for its protective value, enabling humans to avoid potentially deadly plant alkaloids and other environmental toxins. The focus of this review is on recent advances in our understanding of the transduction elements and signaling mechanisms underlying bitter and sweet taste transduction (see Figure 1). The sensations of bitter and sweet tastes are initiated by the interaction of sapid molecules ('tastants') with G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the apical membranes of taste receptor cells (TRCs). TRCs are specialized epithelial cells with many neuronal properties including the ability to depolarize and form synapses. TRCs are typically clustered in groups of ~100 within taste buds. The apical surface of TRCs, which makes contact with the oral cavity, is rich in convoluted microvilli containing GPCRs, ion channels and other transduction elements. The basolateral aspect of TRCs contains ion channels and synapses with afferent taste nerves.",

In mice, genetic deletion of the glucagon receptor (Gcgr) results in increased levels of the insulinotropic hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which may contribute to the alterations in glucose homeostasis observed in Gcgr-/- mice. Here, we assessed the contribution of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling to the phenotype of Gcgr-/- mice by generating Gcgr-/-Glp1r-/- mice. Although insulin sensitivity was similar in all genotypes, fasting glucose was increased in Gcgr-/-Glp1r-/- mice. Elimination of the Glp1r normalized gastric emptying and impaired intraperitoneal glucose tolerance in Gcgr-/- mice. Unexpectedly, deletion of Glp1r in Gcgr-/- mice did not alter the improved oral glucose tolerance and increased insulin secretion characteristic of that genotype. Although Gcgr-/-Glp1r-/- islets exhibited increased sensitivity to the incretin glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), mice lacking both Glp1r and the GIP receptor (Gipr) maintained preservation of the enteroinsular axis following reduction of Gcgr signaling. Moreover, Gcgr-/-Glp1r-/- islets expressed increased levels of the cholecystokinin A receptor (Cckar) and G protein-coupled receptor 119 (Gpr119) mRNA transcripts, and Gcgr-/-Glp1r-/- mice exhibited increased sensitivity to exogenous CCK and the GPR119 agonist AR231453. Our data reveal extensive functional plasticity in the enteroinsular axis via induction of compensatory mechanisms that control nutrient-dependent regulation of insulin secretion.",

After stimulation by intraduodenal infusion of HCl, plasma CCK concentrations, measured with an antiserum specific for the sulfated, bioactive sequence of CCK, increased from 1.4 +/- 0.7 to 42.7 +/- 11.7 pM in portal plasma and from 0.5 +/- 0.3 to 12.3 +/- 1.5 pM in peripheral plasma. The concentrations measured with an antiserum specific for the NH2-terminal sequence 5-10 of CCK-33 were considerably higher, increasing from 64 +/- 17 to 139 +/- 14 pM in portal plasma and from 69 +/- 7 to 102 +/- 9 pM in peripheral plasma. Chromatography suggested that the NH2-terminal immunoreactivity consisted of large CCK fragments devoid of the bioactive COOH-terminal octapeptide, i.e., desocta and/or desnona CCK-58, CCK-39, and CCK-33. The bioactive forms in both portal and peripheral plasma comprised CCK-58-, CCK-33-, CCK-22-, CCK-12-, and CCK-8-like forms. Generally, the CCK-22-like component predominanated, but although CCK-8 was more abundant than CCK-33 in portal plasma, these forms occurred in equal amounts in peripheral plasma. Large amounts of NH2-terminal immunoreactivity were also found in the venous effluent of the isolated perfused duodenum after stimulation with gastrin-releasing peptide; the venous perfusate contained mainly CCK-22- and CCK-8-like material, which together constituted greater than 80% of the bioactive CCK components. Both duodenal and jejunal mucosa contained components resembling NH2-terminal fragments as well as large amounts of intact CCK-58 and CCK-33.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "Cheese yield is the most important technological parameter in the dairy industry in many countries. The aim of this study was to infer (co)variance components for cheese yields (CY) and nutrient recoveries in curd (REC) predicted using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of samples collected during milk recording on Holstein, Brown Swiss, and Simmental dairy cows. A total of 311,354 FTIR spectra representing the test-day records of 29,208 dairy cows (Holstein, Brown Swiss, and Simmental) from 654 herds, collected over a 3-yr period, were available for the study. The traits of interest for each cow consisted of 3 cheese yield traits (%CY: fresh curd, curd total solids, and curd water as a percent of the weight of the processed milk), 4 curd nutrient recovery traits (REC: fat, protein, total solids, and the energy of the curd as a percent of the same nutrient in the processed milk), and 3 daily cheese production traits (daily fresh curd, total solids, and the water of the curd per cow). Calibration equations (freely available upon request to the corresponding author) were used to predict individual test-day observations for these traits. The (co)variance components were estimated for the CY, REC, milk production, and milk composition traits via a set of 4-trait analyses within each breed. All analyses were performed using REML and linear animal models. The heritabilities of the %CY were always higher for Holstein and Brown Swiss cows (0.22 to 0.33) compared with Simmental cows (0.14 to 0.18). In general, the fresh cheese yield (%CYCURD) showed genetic variation and heritability estimates that were slightly higher than those of its components, %CYSOLIDS and %CYWATER. The parameter RECPROTEIN was the most heritable trait in all the 3 breeds, with values ranging from 0.32 to 0.41. Our estimation of the genetic relationships of the CY and REC with milk production and composition revealed that the current selection strategies used in dairy cattle are expected to exert only limited effects on the REC traits. Instead, breeders may be able to exploit genetic variations in the %CY, particularly RECFAT and RECPROTEIN. This last component is not explained by the milk protein content, suggesting that its direct selection could be beneficial for cheese production aptitude. Collectively, our findings indicate that breeding strategies aimed at enhancing CY and REC could be easily and rapidly implemented for dairy cattle populations in which FTIR spectra are routinely acquired from individual milk samples.",

            "abstract": "Cheese yield is an important technological trait in the dairy industry. The aim of this study was to infer the genetic parameters of some cheese yield-related traits predicted using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectral analysis and compare the results with those obtained using an individual model cheese-producing procedure. A total of 1,264 model cheeses were produced using 1,500-mL milk samples collected from individual Brown Swiss cows, and individual measurements were taken for 10 traits: 3 cheese yield traits (fresh curd, curd total solids, and curd water as a percent of the weight of the processed milk), 4 milk nutrient recovery traits (fat, protein, total solids, and energy of the curd as a percent of the same nutrient in the processed milk), and 3 daily cheese production traits per cow (fresh curd, total solids, and water weight of the curd). Each unprocessed milk sample was analyzed using a MilkoScan FT6000 (Foss, Hillerød, Denmark) over the spectral range, from 5,000 to 900 wavenumber × cm(-1). The FTIR spectrum-based prediction models for the previously mentioned traits were developed using modified partial least-square regression. Cross-validation of the whole data set yielded coefficients of determination between the predicted and measured values in cross-validation of 0.65 to 0.95 for all traits, except for the recovery of fat (0.41). A 3-fold external validation was also used, in which the available data were partitioned into 2 subsets: a training set (one-third of the herds) and a testing set (two-thirds). The training set was used to develop calibration equations, whereas the testing subsets were used for external validation of the calibration equations and to estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations of the measured and FTIR-predicted phenotypes. The coefficients of determination between the predicted and measured values in cross-validation results obtained from the training sets were very similar to those obtained from the whole data set, but the coefficient of determination of validation values for the external validation sets were much lower for all traits (0.30 to 0.73), and particularly for fat recovery (0.05 to 0.18), for the training sets compared with the full data set. For each testing subset, the (co)variance components for the measured and FTIR-predicted phenotypes were estimated using bivariate Bayesian analyses and linear models. The intraherd heritabilities for the predicted traits obtained from our internal cross-validation using the whole data set ranged from 0.085 for daily yield of curd solids to 0.576 for protein recovery, and were similar to those obtained from the measured traits (0.079 to 0.586, respectively). The heritabilities estimated from the testing data set used for external validation were more variable but similar (on average) to the corresponding values obtained from the whole data set. Moreover, the genetic correlations between the predicted and measured traits were high in general (0.791 to 0.996), and they were always higher than the corresponding phenotypic correlations (0.383 to 0.995), especially for the external validation subset. In conclusion, we herein report that application of the cross-validation technique to the whole data set tended to overestimate the predictive ability of FTIR spectra, give more precise phenotypic predictions than the calibrations obtained using smaller data sets, and yield genetic correlations similar to those obtained from the measured traits. Collectively, our findings indicate that FTIR predictions have the potential to be used as indicator traits for the rapid and inexpensive selection of dairy populations for improvement of cheese yield, milk nutrient recovery in curd, and daily cheese production per cow.",

However, interest by the local dairy industry in differentiated milk products is increasing. Therefore, farmers may be interested in selecting their animals based on the fat composition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of genetic selection to improve the nutritional quality of bovine milk fat. The heritabilities and correlations among milk yield, fat, protein, and major FA contents in milk were estimated. Heritabilities for FA in milk and fat ranged from 5 to 38%. The genetic correlations estimated among FA reflected the common origin of several groups of FA. Given these results, an index including FA contents with the similar metabolic process of production in the mammary gland could be used, for example, to increase the monounsaturated and conjugated fatty acids in milk. Moreover, the genetic correlations between the percentage of fat and the content of C14:0, C12:0, C16:0, and C18:0 in fat were -0.06, 0.55, 0.60, and 0.84, respectively. This result demonstrates that an increase in fat content is not directly correlated with undesirable changes in FA profile in milk for human health. Based on the obtained genetic parameters, a future selection program to improve the FA composition of milk fat could be initiated.",

            "abstract": "The usual practice today is that milk component phenotypes are predicted using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and they are then, together with pedigree information, used in BLUP for calculation of individual estimated breeding values. Here, this is referred to as the indirect prediction (IP) approach. An alternative approach-a direct prediction (DP) method-is proposed, where genetic analyses are directly conducted on the milk FTIR spectral variables. Breeding values of all derived milk traits (protein, fat, fatty acid composition, and coagulation properties, among others) can then be predicted as traits correlated only to the genetic information of the spectra. For the DP, no need exists to predict the phenotypes before calculating breeding values for each of the traits-the genetic analysis is done once for the spectra, and is applicable to all traits derived from the spectra. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of DP and IP of milk composition and quality traits on prediction error variance (PEV) and genetic gain. A data set containing 27,927 milk FTIR spectral observations and milk composition phenotypes (fat, lactose, and protein) belonging to 14,869 goats of 271 herds was used for training and evaluating models. Partial least squares regression was used for calibrating prediction models for fat, protein, and lactose percentages. Restricted maximum likelihood was used to estimate variance components of the spectral variables after principal components analysis was applied to reduce the spectral dimension. Estimated breeding values were predicted for fat, lactose, and protein percentages using DP and IP methods. The DP approach reduced the mean PEV by 3.73, 4.07, and 7.04% for fat, lactose, and protein percentages, respectively, compared with the IP method. Given the reduction in PEV, relative genetic gains were 2.99, 2.78, and 4.85% for fat, lactose, and protein percentages, respectively. We concluded that more accurate estimated breeding values could be found using genetic components of milk FTIR spectra compared with single-trait animal model analyses on phenotypes predicted from the spectra separately. The potential and application is not only limited to milk FTIR spectra, but could also be extended to any spectroscopy techniques implemented in other species and for other traits.",

            "abstract": "Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is a suitable method to determine bovine milk fat composition. However, the determination of fat composition by gas chromatography, required for calibration of the infrared prediction model, is expensive and labor intensive. It has recently been shown that the number of calibration samples is strongly related to the model's validation r(2) (i.e., accuracy of prediction). However, the effect of the number of calibration samples used, and therefore validation r(2), on the estimated genetic parameters of data predicted using the model needs to be established. To this end, 235 calibration data subsets of different sizes were sampled: n=100, n=250, n=500, and n=1,000 calibration samples. Subsequently, these data subsets were used to calibrate fat composition prediction models for 2 specific fatty acids: C16:0 and C18u (where u=unsaturated). Next, genetic parameters were estimated on predicted fat composition data for these fatty acids. Strong relationships between the number of calibration samples and validation r(2), as well as strong genetic correlations were found. However, the use of n=100 calibration samples resulted in a broad range of validation r(2) values and genetic correlations. Subsequent increases of the number of calibration samples resulted in narrowing patterns for validation r(2) as well as genetic correlations. The use of n=1,000 calibration samples resulted in estimated genetic correlations varying within a range of 0.10 around the average, which seems acceptable. Genetic analyses for the human health-related fatty acids C14:0, C16:0, and C18u, and the ratio of saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids showed that replacing observations on fat composition determined by gas chromatography by predictions based on infrared spectra reduced the potential genetic gain to 98, 86, 96, and 99% for the 4 fatty acid traits, respectively, in dairy breeding schemes where progeny testing is practiced. We conclude that a relatively large number of calibration samples is required to be able to obtain genetic correlations that lie within a limited range. Considering that the routine recording of infrared spectra is relatively cheap and straightforward, we concluded that this methodology provides an excellent means for the dairy industry to genetically alter milk fat composition.",

However, measuring individual protein composition is expensive and time consuming. In this study, we investigated whether protein composition can be predicted based on inexpensive and routinely measured milk Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. Based on 900 calibration and 900 validation samples that had both capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-determined protein composition and FTIR spectra available, low to moderate validation R(2) were reached (from 0.18 for α(S1)-casein to 0.56 for β-lactoglobulin). The potential usefulness of this model on the phenotypic level was investigated by means of achieved selection differentials for 25% of the best animals. For α-lactalbumin (R(2)=0.20), the selection differential amounted to 0.18 g/100g and for casein index (R(2)=0.50) to 1.24 g/100g. We concluded that predictions of protein composition were not accurate enough to enable selection of individual animals. However, for specific purposes when, for example, groups of animals that meet a certain threshold are to be selected, the presented model could be useful in practice on the phenotypic level. The potential usefulness of this model on the genetic level was investigated by means of genetic correlations between CZE-determined and FTIR-predicted protein composition traits. The genetic correlations ranged from 0.62 (β-casein) to 0.97 (whey). Thus, predictions of protein composition, when used as input to estimate breeding values, provide an excellent means for genetic improvement of protein composition. In addition, estimated repeatabilities based on 3 repeated observations of predicted protein composition showed that a considerable amount of prediction error can be removed using repeated observations.",

            "abstract": "Trentingrana (or Grana Trentino) is a Protected Designation of Origin hard cheese produced in the eastern Italian Alps by small cooperative dairy factories. To obtain the certification of quality, wheels are evaluated at 9±1 mo of ripening and those classified as first quality are revaluated at 18±1 mo. Traditionally, the assessment is based on 2 sensory features: namely, the external aspect of the wheel and the internal texture; the latter is evaluated through the sound produced by beating the wheel with a special hammer. Traits considered in the study were the percentage of first-quality wheels of total wheels examined at 9±1 (QW(9 mo)) and 18±1 (QW(18 mo)) mo of ripening, and their combination [i.e., the percentage of first-quality wheels at 18±1 mo of ripening of the number of wheels evaluated at 9±1 mo (QW(tot))]. The experimental unit was the batch of 2 mo of production of each of 10 cooperative dairy factories from 2002 to 2008. Data were analyzed with a model that included fixed effects of dairy factory, year and season of production, and interactions between dairy factory and year, and dairy factory and season. The coefficients of determination of the models were 0.57, 0.68, and 0.67 for QW(9mo), QW(18 mo), and QW(tot), respectively. All factors significantly influenced the traits, with dairy factory being the most important source of variation, followed by season and year of production. Remarkable differences were found between the best and the worst dairy factory for QW(9 mo) (11.5%), QW(18 mo) (21.1%), and QW(tot) (25.6%). The first 4 yr of production had a negative effect on the percentage of wheels labeled as first quality and QW(tot) decreased from 74 to 64%; nevertheless, a complete recovery was detected in the following years. The season of production strongly influenced the studied traits with the best results in spring and summer, and the worst in autumn and winter. Compared with average, the 3 best dairy factories were smaller, with smaller associated farms, and showed lower variation across years and seasons of production. Results support the relevance of routinely assessing and monitoring the quality of Trentingrana cheese.",

Sixty-four grazing cows [32 Holstein (H) and 32 Montbéliarde (M) cows] in the declining phase of lactation (157 d in milk) were allocated to 1 of 2 equivalent groups milked once daily (ODM) or twice daily (TDM) for 7 wk. The full-fat raw milk collected during 24 h from the 4 groups of cows (M-TDM, M-ODM, H-TDM, and H-ODM) was pooled and processed into Cantal cheese 4 times during the last 4 wk of the experimental period. In all, 16 cheeses were made (2 milking frequencies x 2 breeds x 4 replicates) and analyzed after a ripening period of 15 and 28 wk. The results showed that for both breeds, the pooled milk content of fat, whey protein, casein, total protein, and phosphorus as well as rennet clotting time and curd firming time were significantly higher with ODM cows, whereas the casein-to-total protein ratio was lower, and lactose, urea, calcium, and free fatty acids contents of milk remained unchanged. The acidification and draining kinetics of the cheese as well as cheese yields and the chemical and rheological properties of the ripened cheese were not significantly modified by milking frequency. For both breeds, the cheeses derived from ODM cows had a slightly yellower coloration but the other sensory attributes, except for pepper odor, were not significantly affected by milking frequency, thereby demonstrating that ODM does not have an adverse effect on the sensory properties of Cantal cheese. Compared with that of Holstein cows, milk from Montbéliarde cows resulted in a higher cheese yield (+1.250 kg/100 kg of milk) and ripened cheeses with lower pH, dry matter, calcium, sodium chloride, and water-soluble nitrogen concentrations. These cheeses had also a less firm and more elastic texture, a more acidic taste, and a yogurt/whey aroma.",

Numerous sensors that gather this information are either currently available or in development. Nevertheless, there is still a need to adapt these sensors to special requirements of on-farm utilization such as robustness, calibration and maintenance, costs, operating cycle duration, and high sensitivity and specificity. This paper provides an overview of available sensors, ongoing research, and areas of application for analysis of milk constituents. Currently, the recognition of abnormal milk and the control of udder health is achieved mainly by recording electrical conductivity and changes in milk color. Further indicators of inflammation were recently investigated either to satisfy the high specificity necessary for automatic separation of milk or to create reliable alarm lists. Likewise, milk composition, especially fat:protein ratio, milk urea nitrogen content, and concentration of ketone bodies, provides suitable information about energy and protein supply, roughage fraction in the diet, and metabolic imbalances in dairy cows. In this regard, future prospects are to use frequent on-farm measurements of milk constituents for short-term automatic nutritional management. Finally, measuring progesterone concentration in milk helps farmers detect ovulation, pregnancy, and infertility. Monitoring systems for on-farm or on-line analysis of milk composition are mostly based on infrared spectroscopy, optical methods, biosensors, or sensor arrays. Their calibration and maintenance requirements have to be checked thoroughly before they can be regularly implemented on dairy farms.",

The dimensionality of traits was reduced by principal components analysis. Therefore, 46 principal components describing 99.03% of the phenotypic variability were used to create 46 new traits. Variance components were estimated using canonical transformation. Heritability ranged from 0 to 0.35. Twenty-five out of 46 studied traits showed a permanent environment variance greater than genetic variance. Eight traits showed heritability greater than 0.10. Variances of original spectral traits were obtained by back transformation. Heritabilities for each spectral data points ranged from 0.003 to 0.42. In particular, 3 MIR regions showing moderate to high heritability estimates were of potential genetic interest. Heritabilities for specific wave numbers, linked with common milk traits (e.g., lipids, lactose), were similar to those estimated for these traits. This research confirms the genetic variability of the MIR milk spectrum and, therefore, the genetic variation of milk components. The objective of this study was to better understand the genetics of milk composition and, maybe in the future, to select animals to improve milk quality.",

Coagulation and syneresis were continuously monitored using 2 optical sensors detecting light backscatter. The effect of the factors on the sensors' response was also examined. Retention of fat during cheese making was found to be a function of cutting time and temperature, whereas curd yield was found to be a function of those 2 factors and the level of calcium chloride addition. The main effect of temperature on curd moisture was to increase the rate at which whey was expelled. Temperature and calcium chloride addition level were also found to affect the light backscatter profile during coagulation whereas the light backscatter profile during syneresis was a function of temperature and cutting time. The results of this study suggest that there is an optimum firmness at which the gel should be cut to achieve maximum retention of fat and an optimum curd moisture content to maximize product yield and quality. It was determined that to maximize curd yield and quality, it is necessary to maximize firmness while avoiding rapid coarsening of the gel network and microsyneresis. These results could contribute to the optimization of the cheese-making process.",

            "abstract": "Milk coagulation properties (MCP) are conventionally measured using computerized renneting meters, mechanical or optical devices that record curd firmness over time (CF(t)). The traditional MCP are rennet coagulation time (RCT, min), curd firmness (a(30), mm), and curd-firming time (k(20), min). The milk of different ruminant species varies in terms of CF(t) pattern. Milk from Holstein-Friesian and some Scandinavian cattle breeds yields higher proportions of noncoagulating samples, samples with longer RCT and lower a(30), and samples for which k(20) is not estimable, than does milk from Brown Swiss, Simmental, and other local Alpine breeds. The amount, proportion, and genetic variants (especially κ-casein) of milk protein fractions strongly influence MCP and explain variable proportions of the observed differences among breeds and among individuals of the same breed. In addition, other major genes have been shown to affect MCP. Individual repeatability of MCP is high, whereas any herd effect is low; thus, the improvement of MCP should be based principally on selection. Exploitable additive genetic variation in MCP exists and has been assessed using different breeds in various countries. Several models have been formulated that either handle noncoagulating samples or not. The heritability of MCP is similar to that of other milk quality traits and is higher than the heritability of milk yield. Rennet coagulation time and a(30) are highly correlated, both phenotypically and genetically. This means that the use of a(30) data does not add valuable information to that obtainable from RCT; both traits are genetically correlated mainly with milk acidity. Moreover, a(30) is correlated with casein content. The major limitations of traditional MCP can be overcome by prolonging the observation period and by using a novel CF(t) modeling, which uses all available information provided by computerized renneting meters and allows the estimation of RCT, the potential asymptotic curd firmness, the curd-firming rate, and the syneresis rate. Direct measurements of RCT obtained from both mechanical and optical devices show similar heritabilities and exhibit high phenotypic and genetic correlations. Moreover, mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy can predict MCP. The heritabilities of predicted MCP are higher than those of measured MCP, and the 2 sets of values are strongly correlated. Therefore, mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy is a reliable and cheap method whereby MCP can be improved at the population level; this is because such spectra are already routinely acquired from the milk of cows enrolled in milk recording schemes.",

            "abstract": "Modulation of the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is one of the physiological activities of γ-glutamyl peptides such as glutathione (γ-glutamylcysteinylglycine). γ-Glutamyl peptides also possess a flavoring effect, i.e., sensory activity of kokumi substances, which modifies the five basic tastes when added to food. These activities have been shown to be positively correlated, suggesting that kokumi γ-glutamyl peptides are perceived through CaSRs in humans. Our research is based on the hypothesis that the discovery of highly active CaSR agonist peptides will lead to the creation of practical kokumi peptides. Through continuous study of the structure-CaSR-activity relation of a large number of γ-glutamyl peptides, we have determined that the structural requirements for intense CaSR activity of γ-glutamyl peptides are as follows: existence of an N-terminal γ-L-glutamyl residue; existence of a moderately sized, aliphatic, neutral substituent at the second residue in an L-configuration; and existence of a C-terminal carboxylic acid, preferably with the existence of glycine as the third constituent. By the sensory analysis of γ-glutamyl peptides selected by screening using the CaSR activity assay, γ-glutamylvalylglycine was found to be a potent kokumi peptide. Furthermore, norvaline-containing γ-glutamyl peptides, i.e., γ-glutamylnorvalylglycine and γ-glutamylnorvaline, possessed excellent sensory activity of kokumi substances. A novel, practical industrial synthesis of regiospecific γ-glutamyl peptides is also required for their commercialization, which was achieved through the ring opening reaction of N-α-carbobenzoxy-L-glutamic anhydride and amino acids or peptides in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide.",

These characteristics are known as “kokumi taste” and often appear in traditional Japanese cuisine. Although GSH is a typical kokumi taste substance (taste enhancer), its mode of action is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate how the kokumi taste is enhanced by the CaSR, a close relative of the class C G-protein-coupled receptors T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 (sweet and umami receptors). We identified a large number of CaSR agonist γ-glutamyl peptides, including GSH (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) and γ-Glu-Val-Gly, and showed that these peptides elicit the kokumi taste. Further analyses revealed that some known CaSR agonists such as Ca2+, protamine, polylysine, l-histidine, and cinacalcet (a calcium-mimetic drug) also elicit the kokumi taste and that the CaSR-specific antagonist, NPS-2143, significantly suppresses the kokumi taste. This is the first report indicating a distinct function of the CaSR in human taste perception.",

The measurement of a point of subjective equality (PSE) showed that the peptide increases the flavor characteristics but did not affect the intensity of basic tastes, such as sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and umami. However, the threshold value of GSH decreased significantly in an umami solution containing 0.05% each of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and disodium inosinate (IMP). This suggests that GSH interacts with the umami substance and has a certain effect on the flavor. GSH had a characteristic kokumi flavor, such as continuity, mouthfulness, and thickness in the umami solution as well as in a model beef extract constructed from analyzed components at a concentration of 0.02% w/v. Some foodstuffs, including meat, were found to contain GSH above its threshold value, which implicates the contribution of GSH to the flavor. The thermal degradation study suggested that a part of GSH have changed into its disulfide, pyroglutamic acid (PCA), and cyclocysteinylglycine in cooked foodstuffs.",

Setting 18 canteens at the Department of Health, the Health Council, the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, university hospitals, and affiliated non-university hospitals. Intervention A standard hot meal collected from the institutional staff canteens on three random days. Main outcome measure Salt content of the meals measured with an ion selective electrode assay. Results The mean salt content of the meals (7.1 g, SE 0.2 g) exceeded the total daily recommended salt intake of 6 g and was high at all locations: 6.9 g (0.4 g) at the Department of Health and National Health Council; 6.0 g (0.9 g) at the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority; 7.4 g (0.5 g) at university hospital staff canteens; and 7.0 g (0.3 g) at non-university hospital staff canteens. With data from a national food consumption survey, the estimated total mean daily salt intake in people who ate these meals was 15.4 g. This translates into a 23-36% increase in premature cardiovascular mortality compared with people who adhere to the recommended levels of salt intake. Conclusion If salt policy makers eat at their institutional canteens they might consume too much salt, which could put their health at risk.",

Given the role of knowledge as a determinant of food intake, this paper aims to review the current levels of salt knowledge and the association between salt knowledge and dietary salt intake and salt-related dietary practices in the general population. Twenty two studies were included in the review. In general, the studies showed consumers were able to identify the health risks associated with high salt intake. However, knowledge of recommended daily intakes, understanding of the relationships between salt and sodium and foods that contribute most salt to the diet were poor. Four of the five studies which examined the relationships between salt knowledge and salt-related dietary practices reported significant associations. Two important gaps in the current literature were identified. First, there is a need for a robustly validated tool to examine salt knowledge and its impact on salt intake. Second, a comprehensive salt knowledge assessment should include assessment of procedural, as well as declarative, knowledge.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFor decades, dietary sodium intake in the United States has remained high, and few studies have examined strategies for maintaining recommended intakes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe examined the effects of a behavioral intervention, which emphasized spices and herbs, on the maintenance of sodium intake at the recommended intake of 1500 mg/d in individuals to whom the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans apply.\n\n\nDESIGN\nWe conducted a 2-phase study that included adults ≥18 y of age for whom Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 1500 mg Na/d. The study was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, from 2012 to 2014. In phase 1, 55 individuals consumed a low-sodium diet for 4 wk. Participants were provided all foods, snacks, and calorie-containing drinks. In phase 2, 40 participants from phase 1 were randomly assigned to either a behavioral intervention to reduce sodium intake (n = 20) or a self-directed control group (n = 20) for 20 wk. The primary study outcome was the change in mean 24-h urinary sodium excretion during phase 2. Linear regression analyses were used to determine intervention effects on urinary sodium excretion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipant characteristics were as follows: women: 65%; African American: 88%; hypertension: 63%; diabetes: 18%; mean age: 61 y; and mean body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 30. At the end of phase 2, mean 24-h sodium excretion was lower in the behavioral intervention than in the self-directed group (mean difference: -956.8 mg/d; 95% CI: -1538.7, -374.9 mg/d) after sodium intake at screening was controlled for (P = 0.002). These findings persisted in sensitivity analyses that excluded potentially incomplete urine collections [Mage's equation mean difference: -1090 mg/d (P = 0.001); Joosens' equation mean difference: -796 mg/d (P = 0.04)].\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA multifactorial behavioral intervention emphasizing spices and herbs significantly reduced sodium intake. Because of the ubiquity of sodium in the US food supply, multilevel strategies addressing individual behaviors and the food supply are needed to improve adherence to recommendations. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01615159.",

The associations were assessed by multivariable multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic, anthropometric, and health variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn both genders, with increasing age, individuals were more likely to have a high salt liking (men, OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.30; women, OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.19), whereas they were less likely to have a strong sweet liking (men, OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.91; women, OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.68). Current smokers (men, OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.90, 2.78; women, OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.36, 1.66) and heavy drinkers (men, OR: 2.92; 95% CI: 2.37, 3.58; women, OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 2.22, 2.98) were more likely to like salt than nonsmokers and alcohol abstainers. Regarding the sweet taste, women smokers were less likely to like sweets (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.89). Highly uncontrolled eaters [men, OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 2.04, 2.80; women, OR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.99, 2.47) and highly emotional women (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.55) were more likely to have a high liking for sweets than slightly uncontrolled eaters and nonemotional eaters, whereas those with high cognitive restraint (men, OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.46; women, OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.60) and former weight-loss dieters (men, OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.70; women, OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.73) were less likely to have a strong sweet liking compared with those with low cognitive restraint and never-dieters.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAn unhealthy lifestyle that includes smoking and alcohol consumption may influence salt liking, and eating behavior may have an impact on sweet liking. Further research is needed to study the influence of individual factors and sensory liking on dietary intake and weight status.

Complete sodium extraction in-mouth was achieved after 30 s. Using coarse-grained NaCl in breadmaking significantly accelerated sodium release and led to enhanced salt taste, allowing a sodium reduction in bread by 25% while maintaining taste quality. This salt taste enhancement by accelerated sodium delivery can be explained by the increasing contrast in sodium concentration, which is known to determine salt taste perception. For the first time, the resulting inhomogeneous salt distribution in bread prepared by using coarse-grained NaCl was visualized by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy using a sodium-selective, fluorescent dye.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between bitter taste receptor haplotypes and the consumption of vegetables, fruits, berries and sweet foods among an adult Finnish population. A cross-sectional design utilizing data from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns cohort from 2007, which consisted of 1,903 men and women who were 30–45 years of age from five different regions in Finland, was employed. DNA was extracted from blood samples, and hTAS2R38 polymorphisms were determined based on three SNPs (rs713598, rs1726866 and rs10246939). Food consumption was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. The prevalence of the bitter taste-sensitive (PAV/PAV) haplotype was 11.3 % and that of the insensitive (AVI/AVI) haplotype was 39.5 % among this Finnish population. PAV homozygotic women consumed fewer vegetables than did the AVI homozygotic women, 269 g/day (SD 131) versus 301 g/day (SD 187), respectively, p = 0.03 (multivariate ANOVA). Furthermore, the intake of sweet foods was higher among the PAV homozygotes of both genders. Fruit and berry consumption did not differ significantly between the haplotypes in either gender. Individuals perceive foods differently, and this may influence their patterns of food consumption. This study showed that the hTAS2R38 taste receptor gene variation was associated with vegetable and sweet food consumption among adults in a Finnish population.",

Sensory mitigation of sodium reduction through the incorporation of mushrooms was also investigated in the taco blends. The substitution of beef with mushrooms in the carne asada did not alter the overall flavor strength of the dish, but the incorporation of 50% or 80% ground mushroom in the beef taco blend did enhance its overall flavor as well as mushroom, veggie, onion, garlic and earthy flavors, and umami and sweet tastes. Overall flavor intensity of the 25% reduced-salt version of the 80% mushroom taco blend matched that of the full-salt versions of the 100% and 50% beef formulations, thus indicating that the substitution of 80% of the meat with mushrooms did mitigate the 25% sodium reduction in terms of the overall flavor impact of the dish, even if it did not quite compensate for the reduction in salty taste. This proof-of-concept study for the Healthy Flavors Research Initiative indicates that because of their flavor-enhancing umami principles, mushrooms can be used as a healthy substitute for meat and a mitigating agent for sodium reduction in meat-based dishes without loss of overall flavor.",

The major aim was to investigate contributions and interactions of salt and fat on taste pleasantness and perception. The minor aim was to investigate individual fat taste sensitivity (detection threshold of oleic acid [C18:1]) on pleasantness for fat. In a complete factorial design, 49 participants (18–54 years, 12 males) tasted tomato soups with 4 different fat concentrations (0–20%) and 5 different salt concentrations (0.04–2.0%). The preferred concentration and the discrimination ability for both fat and salt were determined by ranking tests. Results show that salt and fat affected pleasantness separately (P < 0.01), with salt having the strongest effect. Fat concentrations 0%, 5%, and 10% did not differ in pleasantness, whereas 20% was less pleasant (P < 0.05). There were no interactions for fat and salt on pleasantness or saltiness and fattiness intensity. Fat taste sensitive participants preferred lower fat concentrations than less sensitive participants (P = 0.008). In conclusion, the strong effect of salt on pleasantness in this study suggests that salt, rather than fat, play a major role in the attraction to savory fatty foods.",

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Latin American and Caribbean health science literature database, and the reference lists of previous reviews. Study selection Randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies in non-acutely ill adults and children assessing the relations between sodium intake and blood pressure, renal function, blood lipids, and catecholamine levels, and in non-acutely ill adults all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Study appraisal and synthesis Potential studies were screened independently and in duplicate and study characteristics and outcomes extracted. When possible we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the effect of lower sodium intake using the inverse variance method and a random effects model. We present results as mean differences or risk ratios, with 95% confidence intervals. Results We included 14 cohort studies and five randomised controlled trials reporting all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or coronary heart disease; and 37 randomised controlled trials measuring blood pressure, renal function, blood lipids, and catecholamine levels in adults. Nine controlled trials and one cohort study in children reporting on blood pressure were also included. In adults a reduction in sodium intake significantly reduced resting systolic blood pressure by 3.39 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.46 to 4.31) and resting diastolic blood pressure by 1.54 mm Hg (0.98 to 2.11). When sodium intake was <2 g/day versus ≥2 g/day, systolic blood pressure was reduced by 3.47 mm Hg (0.76 to 6.18) and diastolic blood pressure by 1.81 mm Hg (0.54 to 3.08). Decreased sodium intake had no significant adverse effect on blood lipids, catecholamine levels, or renal function in adults (P>0.05). There were insufficient randomised controlled trials to assess the effects of reduced sodium intake on mortality and morbidity. The associations in cohort studies between sodium intake and all cause mortality, incident fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease were non-significant (P>0.05). Increased sodium intake was associated with an increased risk of stroke (risk ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.43), stroke mortality (1.63, 1.27 to 2.10), and coronary heart disease mortality (1.32, 1.13 to 1.53). In children, a reduction in sodium intake significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 0.84 mm Hg (0.25 to 1.43) and diastolic blood pressure by 0.87 mm Hg (0.14 to 1.60). Conclusions High quality evidence in non-acutely ill adults shows that reduced sodium intake reduces blood pressure and has no adverse effect on blood lipids, catecholamine levels, or renal function, and moderate quality evidence in children shows that a reduction in sodium intake reduces blood pressure. Lower sodium intake is also associated with a reduced risk of stroke and fatal coronary heart disease in adults. The totality of evidence suggests that most people will likely benefit from reducing sodium intake.",

            "abstract": "Background: In the United Kingdom, sodium reduction targets have been set for a large number of processed food categories. Assessment and monitoring are essential to evaluate progress. Objectives: Our aim was to determine whether household consumer panel food-purchasing data could be used to assess the sodium content of processed foods. Our further objectives were to estimate the mean sodium content of UK foods by category and undertake analyses weighted by food-purchasing volumes. Design: Data were obtained for 21,108 British households between October 2008 and September 2009. Purchasing data (product description, product weight, annual purchases) and sodium values (mg/100 g) were collated for all food categories known to be major contributors to sodium intake. Unweighted and weighted mean sodium values were calculated. Results: Data were available for 44,372 food products. The largest contributors to sodium purchases were table salt (23%), processed meat (18%), bread and bakery products (13%), dairy products (12%), and sauces and spreads (11%). More than one-third of sodium purchased (37%) was accounted for by 5 food categories: bacon, bread, milk, cheese, and sauces. For some food groups (bread and bakery, cereals and cereal products, processed meat), purchase-weighted means were 18–35% higher than unweighted means, suggesting that market leaders have higher sodium contents than the category mean. Conclusion: The targeting of sodium reduction in a small number of food categories and focusing on products sold in the highest volumes could lead to large decreases in sodium available for consumption and therefore to gains in public health.",

As such, it is one of the key public health targets for a salt reduction policy. In this respect, it has been shown that a reduction in the salt content of bread is possible, and an alternative approach involves partial replacement with other, mainly potassium-based salts, which also counteract the effects of sodium. This replacement should be undertaken on the basis of criteria that maintain the product's sensory profile, and it tends to be more successful in breads with more naturally flavorful taste. The present review was conducted to examine salt intake in Europe and the health problems associated with its excessive consumption; particular focus is placed on the salt content of bread and the effects of its possible reduction and/or correction. The beneficial effects of such changes are highlighted by way of a theoretical calculation in baguette-type wheat bread. European legislation in the field of nutrition and health claims allows the positive aspects of such salt reduction and replacement methods to be stated.",

By means of activity-guided fractionation using ultrafiltration, gel permeation chromatography, and hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography in combination with the sensory assay for STM activity assessment, a series of arginyl dipeptides, with RP, RA, AR, RG, RS, RV, VR, and RM being the most active, as well as l-arginine were found as salt taste enhancing molecules in fish protamine digests. For the first time, HPLC-MS/MS analysis on a PFP and a HILIC stationary phase, respectively, enabled the quantitative analysis of the arginyl peptides in a series of commercial and laboratory-made protein hydrolysates as well as fermented fish sauces.",

The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of gradually lowering the salt content in brown bread, with and without flavor compensation (KCl and yeast extract), on bread consumption and sodium intake compensation by choice of sandwich fillings. A total of 116 participants (age: 21 ± 3 y; BMI: 22 ± 2 kg/m²) consumed a buffet-style breakfast on weekdays for 4 wk. Participants received either regular bread (control group: n = 39), bread whose salt content was gradually lowered each week by 0, 31, 52, and 67% (reduced group: n = 38), or bread whose salt content was also gradually lowered each week but which was also flavor compensated (compensated group: n = 39). A reduction of up to 52% of salt in bread did not lead to lower consumption of bread compared to the control (P = 0.57), whereas less bread was consumed when salt was reduced by 67% (P = 0.006). When bread was flavor compensated, however, a reduction of 67% did not lead to lower consumption (P = 0.69). Salt reduction in bread (with and without flavor compensation) did not induce sodium intake compensation (P = 0.31). In conclusion, a salt reduction of up to 52% in bread or even up to 67% in flavor-compensated bread neither affected bread consumption nor choice of sandwich fillings.",

Cheddar and low-moisture, part-skim Mozzarella cheeses were made with total salt levels of 0.7, 1.0, 1.25, 1.35, and 1.8% (wt/wt) in triplicate, thus reducing sodium by 25 to 60%. Multiple manufacturing protocols for salt reduction were used to produce cheeses with similar postpress moisture and pH, independent of the final salt levels in cheese, in order to study the role of salt in cheese acceptability. Cheese flavor was evaluated by a descriptive taste panel on a 15-point intensity scale. Consumer acceptance was evaluated by a consumer panel on a 9-point hedonic scale. Taste panels conducted with cubed Cheddar cheese (at 3 and 6mo) and cold shredded Mozzarella cheese (at 3wk) showed that consumer liking for cheese was low at 0.7 and 0.9% salt, but all cheeses containing higher salt levels (1.25, 1.35, and 1.8% salt) were comparably preferred. The cheeses had acceptable liking scores (≥6) when served as quesadilla or pizza toppings, and consumers were able to differentiate cheeses at alternate salt levels; for example, 1.8 and 1.5% salt cheeses scored similarly, as did cheeses with 1.5% and 1.35% salt, but 1.35% salt cheese scored lower than and was discernible from 1.8% salt cheese. Descriptive panelists perceived salty, sour, umami, bitter, brothy, lactone/fatty acid, and sulfur attributes as different across Mozzarella cheeses, with the perception of each significantly increasing along with salt level. Salty and buttery attributes were perceived more with increasing salt levels of Cheddar cheese by the descriptive panel at 3mo, whereas bitter, brothy, and umami attributes were perceived less at the higher salt levels. However, this trend reversed at 6mo, when perception of salty, sour, bitter, buttery, lactone/fatty acid, and umami attributes increased with salt level. We conclude that consumers can distinguish even a 30% salt reduction and a gradually phased sodium reduction is needed to improve acceptability of lower sodium cheeses.",

            "abstract": "The use of mineral salt replacers to reduce the sodium content in cheese has been investigated as a method to maintain both the salty flavor and the preservative effects of salt. The majority of studies of sodium reduction have used mineral salt replacers at levels too low to produce equal water activity (a(w)) in the finished cheese compared with the full-sodium control. Higher a(w) can result in differences in cheese quality due to differences in the effective salt-to-moisture ratio. This creates differences in biochemical and microbial reactions during aging. We hypothesized that by targeting replacer concentrations to produce the same a(w) as full sodium cheese, changes in cheese quality would be minimized. Stirred-curd Cheddar-style cheese was manufactured and curd was salted with NaCl or naturally reduced sodium sea salt. Reduced-sodium cheeses were created by blends of NaCl or sea salt with KCl, modified KCl, MgCl₂, or CaCl₂ before pressing. Sodium levels in reduced-sodium cheeses ranged from 298 to 388 mg of sodium/100g, whereas the control full-sodium cheese had 665 mg/100g. At 1 wk of age, a(w) of reduced-sodium cheeses were not significantly different from control, which had an a(w) of 0.96. The pH values of all reduced-sodium cheeses, excluding the treatment that combined sea salt and MgCl₂, were lower than those of full-sodium cheese, indicating that the starter culture was possibly less inhibited at the salting step by the replacers than by NaCl. Instrumental hardness values of the treatments with sea salt were higher than in cheeses containing NaCl, with the exception of the NaCl/CaCl₂ treatment, which was the hardest. Treatments with MgCl₂ and modified KCl were generally less hard than other treatments. In-hand and first-bite firmness values correlated with the instrumental texture profile analysis results. Both CaCl₂ and MgCl₂ produced considerable off-flavors in the cheese (bitter, metallic, unclean, and soapy), as measured by descriptive sensory analysis with a trained panel. Bitterness ratings for cheese with KCl and modified KCl were not significantly different from the full-sodium control. Potassium chloride can be used successfully to achieve large reductions in sodium when replacing a portion of the NaCl in Cheddar cheese.",

However, evidence demonstrating that the sensation of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA, the proposed stimuli for \"fat taste\") differs qualitatively from other tastes is lacking. Using perceptual mapping, we demonstrate that medium and long-chain NEFA have a taste sensation that is distinct from other basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter). Although some overlap was observed between these NEFA and umami taste, this overlap is likely due to unfamiliarity with umami sensations rather than true similarity. Shorter chain fatty acids stimulate a sensation similar to sour, but as chain length increases this sensation changes. Fat taste oral signaling, and the different signals caused by different alkyl chain lengths, may hold implications for food product development, clinical practice, and public health policy.",

This “anion effect” has been hypothesized to result from inhibitory transepithelial potentials (TPs) generated across the lingual epithelium as cations permeate through tight junctions and leave their larger and less permeable anions behind (Ye et al., 1991). We tested directly the necessity of TPs for the anion effect by measuring responses to NaCl and Na-gluconate (small and large anion sodium salts, respectively) in isolated taste cells from mouse circumvallate papillae. Using calcium imaging, we identified AI salt-responsive type III taste cells and demonstrated that they compose a subpopulation of acid-responsive taste cells. Even in the absence of TPs, many (66%) AI salt-responsive type III taste cells still exhibited the anion effect, demonstrating that some component of the transduction machinery for salty taste in type III cells is sensitive to anion size. We hypothesized that osmotic responses could explain why a minority of type III cells (34%) had AI salt responses but lacked anion sensitivity. All AI type III cells had osmotic responses to cellobiose, which were significantly modulated by extracellular sodium concentration, suggesting the presence of a sodium-conducting osmotically sensitive ion channel. However, these responses were significantly larger in AI type III cells that did not exhibit the anion effect.

The earliest and lasting histological change was hyaline thickening of the capillary walls and adjacent intercapillary regions of the glomerular tufts, corresponding in location to polysaccharide-rich capillary basement membrane and mesangial materials. Distributed focally and diffusely in the glomerular tuft and eventually sparing no glomerulus, hyaline, granular, and fibrillar (\"spongy fiber\") materials produced narrowing of capillary lumens by concentric or eccentric encroachment upon them. In the later stages hyaline lobulation and sclerosis of the glomerular tufts occurred. Thus the lesions corresponded to those seen in human focal and diffuse membranous, chronic lobular, and lastly (intracapillary) sclerosing glomerulonephritis. In all instances of glomerulonephritis the glomerular tufts contained selective localizations of mouse immunoglobulins corresponding in distribution to that of the hyaline and (PAS-positive) polysaccharide-rich materials in the focal and diffuse membranous and lobular lesions and in amounts increasing with the severity of glomerular disease. The mouse immunoglobulins were extracted from frozen sections of glomerulonephritic kidneys and were then capable of recombination with glomerular tufts in sections of autologous or isologous glomerulonephritic kidneys from which in vivo localized immunoglobulins had been extracted. The pattern of recombination with glomerular tufts was similar to that of in invo localized immunoglobulins. The extracted immunoglobulins did not show affinity for mouse red cells (in the indirect Coombs test) nor for autologous or isologous cell nuclei (in the immunofluorescence test). The serum of mice with severe glomerulonephritis contained immunoglobulins with in vitro affinity for extracted autologous or isologous glomerular tufts. Thus circulating as well as localized antibodies were demonstrated. The immunogenic materials (autoantigens) may have been formed in the glomerular tufts or accumulated in them from some other source, such as the circulating plasma; however they corresponded in location to polysaccharide-rich capillary basement membrane and mesangial materials. The spleen was identified at the cellular level as the main site of formation of autoantibodies to red cells, as well as the main site of red cell destruction. Some evidence was brought forth suggesting that these autoantibodies were \"heavy\" or γM-globulins. More studies are in progress.",

            "abstract": "Taste sensory responses from the chorda tympani nerve of the rat were recorded with the lingual receptive field under current or voltage clamp. Consistent with previous results (Ye, Q., G. L. Heck, and J. A. DeSimone. 1993. Journal of Neurophysiology. 70:167-178), responses to NaCl were highly sensitive to lingual voltage clamp condition. This can be attributed to changes in the electrochemical driving force for Na+ ions through apical membrane transducer channels in taste cells. In contrast, responses to KCl over the concentration range 50-500 mM were insensitive to the voltage clamp condition of the receptive field. These results indicate the absence of K+ conductances comparable to those for Na+ in the apical membranes of taste cells. This was supported by the strong anion dependence of K salt responses. At zero current clamp, the potassium gluconate (KGlu) threshold was > 250 mM, and onset kinetics were slow (12 s to reach half-maximal response). Faster onset kinetics and larger responses to KGlu occurred at negative voltage clamp (-50 mV). This indicates that when K+ ion is transported as a current, and thereby uncoupled from gluconate mobility, its rate of delivery to the K+ taste transducer increases. Analysis of conductances shows that the paracellular pathway in the lingual epithelium is 28 times more permeable to KCl than to KGlu. Responses to KGlu under negative voltage clamp were not affected by agents that are K+ channel blockers in other systems. The results indicate that K salt taste transduction is under paracellular diffusion control, which limits chemoreception efficiency. We conclude that rat K salt taste occurs by means of a subtight junctional transducer for K+ ions with access limited by anion mobility. The data suggest that this transducer is not cation selective which also accounts for the voltage and amiloride insensitive part of the response to NaCl.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundTaste buds are the sensory organs of taste perception. Three types of taste cells have been described. Type I cells have voltage-gated outward currents, but lack voltage-gated inward currents. These cells have been presumed to play only a support role in the taste bud. Type II cells have voltage-gated Na+ and K+ current, and the receptors and transduction machinery for bitter, sweet, and umami taste stimuli. Type III cells have voltage-gated Na+, K+, and Ca2+ currents, and make prominent synapses with afferent nerve fibers. Na+ salt transduction in part involves amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). In rodents, these channels are located in taste cells of fungiform papillae on the anterior part of the tongue innervated by the chorda tympani nerve. However, the taste cell type that expresses ENaCs is not known. This study used whole cell recordings of single fungiform taste cells of transgenic mice expressing GFP in Type II taste cells to identify the taste cells responding to amiloride. We also used immunocytochemistry to further define and compare cell types in fungiform and circumvallate taste buds of these mice.ResultsTaste cell types were identified by their response to depolarizing voltage steps and their presence or absence of GFP fluorescence. TRPM5-GFP taste cells expressed large voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents, but lacked voltage-gated Ca2+ currents, as expected from previous studies. Approximately half of the unlabeled cells had similar membrane properties, suggesting they comprise a separate population of Type II cells. The other half expressed voltage-gated outward currents only, typical of Type I cells. A single taste cell had voltage-gated Ca2+ current characteristic of Type III cells. Responses to amiloride occurred only in cells that lacked voltage-gated inward currents. Immunocytochemistry showed that fungiform taste buds have significantly fewer Type II cells expressing PLC signalling components, and significantly fewer Type III cells than circumvallate taste buds.ConclusionThe principal finding is that amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels appear to be expressed in cells that lack voltage-gated inward currents, likely the Type I taste cells. These cells were previously assumed to provide only a support function in the taste bud.",

In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a non-selective detector for a wide range of salts. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities—sweet, sour, bitter and umami—are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCα in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice.",

            "abstract": "The role of amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels (ASSCs) in the transduction of salty taste stimuli in rat fungiform taste buds has been well established. Evidence for the involvement of ASSCs in salt transduction in circumvallate and foliate taste buds is, at best, contradictory. In an attempt to resolve this apparent controversy, we have begun to look for functional ASSCs in taste buds isolated from fungiform, foliate, and circumvallate papillae of male Sprague-Dawley rats. By use of a combination of whole-cell and nystatin-perforated patch-clamp recording, cells within the taste bud that exhibited voltage-dependent currents, reflective of taste receptor cells (TRCs), were subsequently tested for amiloride sensitivity. TRCs were held at - 70 mV, and steady-state current and input resistance were monitored during superfusion of Na(+)-free saline and salines containing amiloride (0.1 microM to 1 mM). Greater than 90% of all TRCs from each of the papillae responded to Na+ replacement with a decrease in current and an increase in input resistance, reflective of a reduction in electrogenic Na+ movement into the cell. ASSCs were found in two thirds of fungiform and in one third of foliate TRCs, whereas none of the circumvallate TRCs was amiloride sensitive. These findings indicate that the mechanism for Na+ influx differs among taste bud types. All amiloride-sensitive currents had apparent inhibition constants in the submicromolar range. These results agree with afferent nerve recordings and raise the possibility that the extensive labeling of the ASSC protein and mRNA in the circumvallate papillae may reflect a pool of nonfunctional channels or a pool of channels that lacks sensitivity to amiloride.",

Our experiments showed that CaV1.2 currents expressed in HEK293 cells are strongly inhibited by replacing extracellular chloride with gluconate or perchlorate. Variance-mean analysis of ICa and cell-attached patch single channel recordings indicate that gluconate-induced inhibition is due to intracellular anion effects on Ca2+ channel open probability, not conductance. Inhibition of CaV1.2 currents produced by replacing chloride with gluconate was reduced from ∼75%–80% to ∼50% by omitting β subunits but unaffected by omitting α2δ subunits. Similarly, gluconate inhibition was reduced to ∼50% by deleting an α1 subunit N-terminal region of 15 residues critical for β subunit interactions regulating open probability. Omitting β subunits with this mutant α1 subunit did not further diminish inhibition. Gluconate inhibition was unchanged with expression of different β subunits. Truncating the C terminus at AA1665 reduced gluconate inhibition from ∼75%–80% to ∼50% whereas truncating it at AA1700 had no effect. Neutralizing arginines at AA1696 and 1697 by replacement with glutamines reduced gluconate inhibition to ∼60% indicating these residues are particularly important for anion effects. Expressing CaV1.2 channels that lacked both N and C termini reduced gluconate inhibition to ∼25% consistent with additive interactions between the two tail regions. Our results suggest that modest changes in intracellular anion concentration can produce significant effects on CaV1.2 currents mediated by changes in channel open probability involving β subunit interactions with the N terminus and a short C terminal region.",

We recorded multiunit responses from the severed CT nerve and single-cell responses from intact, narrowly tuned and broadly tuned, salt-sensitive neurons in the geniculate ganglion simultaneously with stimulus-evoked summated potentials to signal when the stimulus contacted the lingual epithelium. Artificial saliva served as the rinse and solvent for all stimuli (0.3 M NH(4)Cl, 0.5 M sucrose, 0.03-0.5 M NaCl, 0.01 M citric acid, 0.02 M quinine hydrochloride, 0.1 M KCl, and 0.03-0.5 M Na-gluconate). We used the pharmacological antagonist benzamil to assess NaCl responses mediated by ENaC, and SB-366791 and cetylpyridinium chloride to assess responses mediated by TRPV1. CT nerve responses were greater to NaCl than Na-gluconate at each concentration; this was attributed mostly to broadly tuned, acid-generalist neurons that responded with higher frequency and shorter latency to NaCl than Na-gluconate. In contrast, narrowly tuned NaCl-specialist neurons responded more similarly to the two salts, but with subtle differences in temporal pattern. Benzamil reduced CT nerve and single-cell responses only of narrowly tuned neurons to NaCl. Surprisingly, SB-366791 and cetylpyridinium chloride were without effect on CT nerve or single-cell NaCl responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role that apical ENaCs in fungiform papillae play in processing information about sodium by peripheral gustatory neurons; the role of TRPV1 channels is an enigma.",

We combined functional calcium imaging with single-cell molecular profiling to demonstrate the existence of two distinct cell types in mouse taste buds. Calcium imaging revealed that isolated taste cells responded with a transient elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ to either tastants or depolarization with KCl, but never both. Using single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, we show that individual taste cells express either phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2) (an essential taste transduction effector) or synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) (a key component of calcium-triggered transmitter exocytosis). The two functional classes revealed by calcium imaging mapped onto the two gene expression classes determined by single-cell RT-PCR. Specifically, cells responding to tastants expressed PLCβ2, whereas cells responding to KCl depolarization expressed SNAP25. We demonstrate this by two methods: first, through sequential calcium imaging and single-cell RT-PCR; second, by performing calcium imaging on taste buds in slices from transgenic mice in which PLCβ2-expressing taste cells are labeled with green fluorescent protein. To evaluate the significance of the SNAP25-expressing cells, we used RNA amplification from single cells, followed by RT-PCR. We show that SNAP25-positive cells also express typical presynaptic proteins, including a voltage-gated calcium channel (α1A), neural cell adhesion molecule, synapsin-II, and the neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes glutamic acid decarboxylase and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase. No synaptic markers were detected in PLCβ2 cells by either amplified RNA profiling or by immunocytochemistry. These data demonstrate the existence of at least two molecularly distinct functional classes of taste cells: receptor cells and synapse-forming cells.",

In adult mice, nerve fibers and some elongated taste bud cells reacted with anti-N-CAM antibody. Immunoelectron microscopic observation showed that only type-III (gustatory) cells, which have afferent synaptic contacts with the nerves, were N-CAM positive in the taste buds. At day 0 after birth, taste buds of the developing mice first appeared in the circumvallate papillae, and N-CAM positive cells, which corresponded to type-III cells having afferent synapses, were found. This result suggests that N-CAM is involved in formation of the synaptic contacts between type-III cells and nerves in the taste buds.",

        "abstract": "TRPV1t, a variant of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) has been proposed as a constitutively active, non-selective cation channel as a putative amiloride-insensitive salt taste receptor and shares many properties with TRPV1. Based on our previous chorda tympani taste nerve recordings in rodents and human sensory evaluations, we proposed that N-geranylcyclopropylcarboxamide (NGCC), a novel synthetic compound, acts as a salt taste enhancer by modulating the amiloride/benzamil-insensitive Na+ entry pathways. As an extension of this work, we investigated NGCC-induced human TRPV1 (hTRPV1) activation using a Ca2+-flux signaling assay in cultured cells. NGCC enhanced Ca2+ influx in hTRPV1-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 115 µM). NGCC-induced Ca2+ influx was significantly attenuated by ruthenium red (RR; 30 µM), a non-specific blocker of TRP channels and capsazepine (CZP; 5 µM), a specific antagonist of TRPV1, implying that NGCC directly activates hTRPV1. TRPA1 is often co-expressed with TRPV1 in sensory neurons. Therefore, we also investigated the effects of NGCC on hTRPA1-expressing cells. Similar to hTRPV1, NGCC enhanced Ca2+ influx in hTRPA1-expressing cells (EC50 = 83.65 µM). The NGCC-induced Ca2+ influx in hTRPA1-expressing cells was blocked by RR (30 µM) and HC-030031 (100 µM), a specific antagonist of TRPA1. These results suggested that NGCC selectively activates TRPV1 and TRPA1 in cultured cells. These data may provide additional support for our previous hypothesis that NGCC interacts with TRPV1 variant cation channel, a putative amiloride/benzamil-insensitive salt taste pathway in the anterior taste receptive field.",

            "abstract": "Brazilian green propolis is a popular health supplement because of its various biological properties. The ethanol extract of Brazilian green propolis (EEBP) is characteristic for its herb-like smell and unique pungent taste. However, the ingredients responsible for its pungency have not yet been identified. This study provides the first evidence that artepillin C is the main pungent ingredient in EEBP and that it potently activates human transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels. EEBP was fractionated using column chromatography with a step gradient elution of an ethanol-water solution, and the fractions having the pungent taste were determined by sensory tests. HPLC analysis revealed that the pungent fraction was composed primarily of artepillin C, a prenylated derivative of cinnamic acid. Artepillin C was also identified as the pungent compound of EEBP by organoleptic examiners. Furthermore, the effects of artepillin C and other cinnamic acids found in EEBP on TRPA1 channels were examined by calcium imaging and plate reader-based assays in human TRPA1-expressing cells to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying their pungent tastes. Artepillin C and baccharin activated the TRPA1 channel strongly, whereas drupanin caused a slight activation and p-coumaric acid showed no activation. Because the EC50 values of artepillin C, baccharin, and allyl isothiocyanate were 1.8 µM, 15.5 µM, and 6.2 µM, respectively, artepillin C was more potent than the typical TRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate. These findings strongly indicate that artepillin C is the main pungent ingredient in EEBP and stimulates a pungent taste by activating TRPA1 channels.",

            "abstract": "The effect of ethanol on the amiloride- and benzamil (Bz)-insensitive salt taste receptor was investigated by direct measurement of intracellular Na+ activity ([Na+]i) using fluorescence imaging in polarized fungiform taste receptor cells (TRCs) and by chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve recordings. CT responses to KCl and NaCl were recorded in Sprague-Dawley rats, and in wild-type (WT) and vanilloid receptor-1 (VR-1) knockout mice (KO). CT responses were monitored in the presence of Bz, a specific blocker of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). CT responses were also recorded in the presence of agonists (resiniferatoxin and elevated temperature) and antagonists (capsazepine and SB-366791) of VR-1 that similarly modulate the Bz-insensitive VR-1 variant salt taste receptor. In the absence of mineral salts, ethanol induced a transient decrease in TRC volume and elicited only transient phasic CT responses. In the presence of mineral salts, ethanol increased the apical cation flux in TRCs without a change in volume, increased transepithelial electrical resistance across the tongue, and elicited CT responses that were similar to salt responses, consisting of both a phasic component and a sustained tonic component. At concentrations <50%, ethanol enhanced responses to KCl and NaCl, while at ethanol concentrations >50%, those CT responses were inhibited. Resiniferatoxin and elevated temperature increased the sensitivity of the CT response to ethanol in salt-containing media, and SB-366791 inhibited the effect of ethanol, resiniferatoxin, and elevated temperature on the CT responses to mineral salts. VR-1 KO mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive CT response to NaCl and no sensitivity to ethanol. We conclude that ethanol increases salt taste sensitivity by its direct action on the Bz-insensitive VR-1 variant salt taste receptor.",

CT responses in Sprague-Dawley rats and both wildtype and TRPV1 knockout (KO) mice were recorded in the presence and absence of agonists [resiniferatoxin (RTX) and elevated temperature] and an antagonist (SB-366791) of TRPV1t, the ENaC blocker (Bz), and varying apical pH (pH(o)). At concentrations <0.015 M, nicotine enhanced and at >0.015 M, it inhibited CT responses to KCl and NaCl. Nicotine produced maximum enhancement in the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response at pH(o) between 6 and 7. RTX and elevated temperature increased the sensitivity of the CT response to nicotine in salt-containing media, and SB-366791 inhibited these effects. TRPV1 KO mice demonstrated no Bz-insensitive CT response to NaCl and no sensitivity to nicotine, RTX, and elevated temperature. We conclude that nicotine modulates salt responses by direct interaction with TRPV1t. At pH(o) >8, the apical membrane permeability of nicotine was increased significantly, resulting in increase in TRC pH(i) and volume, activation of ENaC, and enhancement of the Bz-sensitive NaCl CT response. At pH(o) >8, nicotine also inhibited the phasic component of the HCl CT response. We conclude that the effects of nicotine on ENaC and the phasic HCl CT response arise from increases in TRC pH(i) and volume.",

Whereas electrophysiological evidence from the chorda tympani nerve (CT) has implicated the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channel as a major component of amiloride-insensitive salt taste transduction, behavioral results have provided only equivocal support. Using a brief-access taste test, we examined generalization profiles of water-deprived C57BL/6J (WT) and TRPV1 knockout (KO) mice conditioned (via LiCl injection) to avoid 100 μM amiloride-prepared 0.25 M NaCl and tested with 0.25 M NaCl, sodium gluconate, KCl, NH(4)Cl, 6.625 mM citric acid, 0.15 mM quinine, and 0.5 M sucrose. Both LiCl-injected WT and TRPV1 KO groups learned to avoid NaCl+amiloride relative to controls, but their generalization profiles did not differ; LiCl-injected mice avoided the nonsodium salts and quinine suggesting that a TRPV1-independent pathway contributes to the taste quality of the amiloride-insensitive portion of the NaCl signal. Repeating the experiment but doubling all stimulus concentrations revealed a difference in generalization profiles between genotypes. While both LiCl-injected groups avoided the nonsodium salts and quinine, only WT mice avoided the sodium salts and citric acid. CT responses to these stimuli and a concentration series of NaCl and KCl with and without amiloride did not differ between genotypes. Thus, in our study, TRPV1 did not appear to contribute to sodium salt perception based on gustatory signals, at least in the CT, but may have contributed to the oral somatosensory features of sodium.",

Recent research has revealed that a remarkable diversity of cellular mechanisms are involved in taste stimulus reception. These mechanisms range from G protein-and second messenger-linked receptor systems to stimulus-gated and stimulus-admitting ion channels. Contrary to widely held ideas, new data show that some taste stimuli interact with receptive sites that are localized on both the apical and basolateral membranes of taste cells. Studies of taste system development in several species indicate that the transduction pathways for some stimuli are modulated significantly during the early postnatal period. In addition, recent investigations of adult peripheral gustatory system plasticity strongly suggest that the function of the Na+ sensing system can be modulated by circulating hormones, growth factors, or cytokines.",

To investigate if the amiloride- and benzamil (Bz)-insensitive NaCl chorda tympani (CT) taste nerve response is also regulated in part by TRPM5, CT responses to 100 mM NaCl + 5 μM Bz (NaCl + Bz) were monitored in Sprague-Dawley rats, wild-type (WT) mice, and TRP vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1) and TRPM5 knockout (KO) mice in the presence of resiniferatoxin (RTX), a TRPV1 agonist. In rats, NaCl + Bz + RTX CT responses were also monitored in the presence of triphenylphosphine oxide, a specific TRPM5 blocker, and capsazepine and N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamid (SB-366791), specific TRPV1 blockers. In rats and WT mice, RTX produced biphasic effects on the NaCl + Bz CT response, enhancing the response at 0.5-1 μM and inhibiting it at >1 μM. The NaCl + Bz + SB-366791 CT response in rats and WT mice and the NaCl + Bz CT response in TRPV1 KO mice were inhibited to baseline level and were RTX-insensitive. In rats, blocking TRPV1 by capsazepine or TRPM5 by triphenylphosphine oxide inhibited the tonic NaCl + Bz CT response and shifted the relationship between RTX concentration and the magnitude of the tonic CT response to higher RTX concentrations. TRPM5 KO mice elicited no constitutive NaCl + Bz tonic CT response. The relationship between RTX concentration and the magnitude of the tonic NaCl + Bz CT response was significantly attenuated and shifted to higher RTX concentrations. The results suggest that pharmacological or genetic alteration of TRPM5 activity modulates the Bz-insensitive NaCl CT response and its modulation by TRPV1 agonists.",

Because circumvallate papillae (CVPs) express both GLP-1 and its receptor, a local regulation has been suggested. However, whether dietary lipids are involved in this regulation, as shown in the gut, is unknown. By using a combination of biochemical, immunohistochemical, and behavioral approaches, the present data i) confirm the role of GLP-1 signaling in the attraction for sucrose, ii) demonstrate that minute quantities of long-chain FAs (LCFAs) reinforce the attraction for sucrose in a GLP-1 receptor-dependent manner, iii) suggest an involvement of the LCFA receptor GPR120 expressed in taste buds in this system, and iv) support the existence of a regulation by GLP-1 of the lipid sensing mediated by lingual CD36. Therefore, oro-sensory detection of LCFAs may affect sweet and fatty taste responsiveness by controlling the secretion of lingual GLP-1. This regulatory loop, probably triggered by the LCFA-GPR120 interaction, might contribute to the high palatability of foods rich both in fat and sugar.",

            "abstract": "Membrane CD36 functions in the uptake of fatty acids (FAs), oxidized lipoproteins and in signal transduction after binding these ligands. In rodents, CD36 is implicated in abnormal lipid metabolism, inflammation and atherosclerosis. In humans, CD36 variants have been identified to influence free FA and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and to associate with the risk of the metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease and stroke. In this study, 15 common lipid-associated CD36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated for the impact on monocyte CD36 expression (protein and transcript) in 104 African Americans. In a subset of subjects, the SNPs were tested for association with monocyte surface CD36 (n=65) and platelet total CD36 (n=57). The relationship between CD36 expression and serum HDL and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) levels was also examined. After a permutation-based correction for multiple tests, four SNPs (rs1761667, rs3211909, rs3211913, rs3211938) influenced monocyte CD36 protein and two (rs3211909, rs3211938) platelet CD36. The effect of the HDL-associated SNPs on CD36 expression inversely related to the impact on serum HDL and potential causality was supported by Mendelian randomization analysis. Consistent with this, monocyte CD36 protein negatively correlated with total HDL and HDL subfractions. In contrast, positive correlations were documented between monocyte CD36 and VLDL lipid, particle number and apolipoprotein B. In conclusion, CD36 variants that reduce protein expression appear to promote a protective metabolic profile. The SNPs in this study may have predictive potential on CD36 expression and disease susceptibility in African Americans. Further studies are warranted to validate and determine whether these findings are population specific.",

FFAs depolarize the membrane potential of isolated rat taste receptor cells by inhibiting delayed rectifying potassium channels. This study examined the licking response of rats to sweet, salt, sour, and bitter taste solutions when 88 muM linoleic acid, 88 muM oleic acid, or an 88 muM linoleic-oleic acid mixture was added to the solutions. The presence of linoleic, oleic, and the linoleic-oleic acid mixture in sweet solutions produced increases in the licking responses, whereas adding linoleic, oleic, and the linoleic-oleic acid mixture to salt, sour, or bitter taste solutions produced decreases in licking responses when compared with the licking responses to the solutions in the absence of the FFAs. We conclude that FFAs may act in the oral cavity to depolarize taste receptor cells and therefore to increase the perceived intensity of concomitant tastants, thus contributing to the enhanced palatability associated with foods containing high dietary fat.",

In this paper, we focus on the dendrite structure of sodium chloride (NaCl) formed by the simple evaporation of an aqueous NaCl solution. The characteristics of the growth structures were measured as a function of the initial concentration of NaCl. In addition, the crystal growth process was measured using optical microscopy. As a result, the growth rate was not constant but was found to oscillate over time and synchronize with the wetting of the crystal. Our observations indicate that dendrite structures are more easily generated at higher initial concentrations. The detailed mechanism for dendrite pattern formation is still under investigation.",

It is assumed that the pertinent concentration field obeys Laplace's equation, an assumption whose conditions of validity are discussed in detail and are often satisfied in practice. A dispersion law is found for the rate of change of the amplitude of the various harmonics. It is shown that the sphere is stable below and unstable above a certain radius Rc, which is just seven times the critical radius of nucleation theory; analogous conclusions are obtained for the solidification problem. The results for the sphere are used to discuss the stability of nonspherical growth forms.",

        "abstract": "Most mammals prefer the sweet taste of sugars, which is mediated by the heterodimeric T1R2+T1R3 taste receptor. Sugar appetite is also enhanced by the post-oral reinforcing actions of the nutrient in the gut. Here, we examined the contribution of gut T1R3 (either alone or as part of the T1R3+T1R3 receptor) to post-oral sugar reinforcement using a flavor-conditioning paradigm. We trained mice to associate consumption of a flavored solution (CS+) with intragastric (IG) infusions of a sweetener, and a different flavored solution (CS-) with IG infusions of water (23 h/day); then, we measured preference in a CS+ vs. CS- choice test. In experiment 1, we predicted that if activation of gut T1R3 mediates sugar reinforcement, then IG infusions of a nutritive (sucrose) or nonnutritive (sucralose) ligand for this receptor should condition a preference for the CS+ in B6 wild-type (WT) mice. While the mice that received IG sucrose infusions developed a strong preference for the CS+, those that received IG sucralose infusions developed a weak avoidance of the CS+. In experiment 2, we used T1R3 knockout (KO) mice to examine the necessity of gut T1R2+T1R3 receptors for conditioned flavor preferences. If intact gut T1R3 (or T1R2+T1R3) receptors are necessary for flavor-sugar conditioning, then T1R3 KO mice should not develop a sugar-conditioned flavor preference. We found that T1R3 KO mice, like WT mice, acquired a strong preference for the CS+ paired with IG sucrose infusions. The KO mice were also like WT mice in avoiding a CS+ flavor paired with IG sucralose infusions These findings provide clear evidence that gut T1R3 receptors are not necessary for sugar-conditioned flavor preferences or sucralose-induced flavor avoidance in mice.",

Intestinal infusions of carbohydrate and fat suppress food intake, and this satiety action is inhibited by capsaicin, a neurotoxin that produces a partial visceral deafferentation. This study determined if the postingestive reinforcing action of nutrients is also suppressed by capsaicin treatment. Food-restricted control and capsaicin-treated rats were trained to drink a flavored solution paired with intraduodenal infusions of carbohydrate (Polycose solution) on some days and, on other days, a differently flavored solution paired with intraduodenal water infusions. In a choice test, both groups displayed a strong preference for the Polycose-paired flavor. In a subsequent satiety test, however, intraduodenal Polycose suppressed sucrose sham feeding in the controls but not in capsaicin-treated rats. The same rats were next trained to associate new flavors with intraduodenal fat (corn oil emulsion) and intraduodenal water infusions. During training, oil infusions reduced oral intakes in the controls much more than in the capsaicin-treated rats. Both groups reliably preferred the oil-paired flavor in the subsequent choice test. These results indicate that, unlike the satiating effect of intestinal carbohydrate and fat, the reinforcing actions of these nutrients are not mediated by capsaicin-sensitive visceral afferents. The data also imply that the postingestive reinforcement produced by nutrients is not dependent on the nutrients' satiating quality.",

A previous study reported that mice with an internal deletion of Trpm5, lacking exons 15-19 encoding transmembrane segments 1-5, showed no taste-mediated responses to bitter, sweet, and umami compounds. We independently generated knockout mice null for Trpm5 protein expression due to deletion of Trpm5's promoter region and exons 1-4 (including the translation start site). We examined the taste-mediated responses of Trpm5 null mice and wild-type (WT) mice using three procedures: gustatory nerve recording [chorda tympani (CT) and glossopharyngeal (NG) nerves], initial lick responses, and 24-h two-bottle preference tests. With bitter compounds, the Trpm5 null mice showed reduced, but not abolished, avoidance (as indicated by licking responses and preference ratios higher than those of WT), a normal CT response, and a greatly diminished NG response. With sweet compounds, Trpm5 null mice showed no licking response, a diminished preference ratio, and absent or greatly reduced nerve responses. With umami compounds, Trpm5 null mice showed no licking response, a diminished preference ratio, a normal NG response, and a greatly diminished CT response. Our results demonstrate that the consequences of eliminating Trmp5 expression vary depending upon the taste quality and the lingual taste field examined. Thus, while Trpm5 is an important factor in many taste responses, its absence does not eliminate all taste responses. We conclude that Trpm5-dependent and Trpm5-independent pathways underlie bitter, sweet, and umami tastes.",

            "abstract": "When a rodent licks a sweet-tasting solution, taste circuits in the central nervous system that facilitate stimulus identification, motivate intake, and prepare the body for digestion are activated. Here, we asked whether taste also determines daily intake of sugar solutions in C57BL/6 mice. We tested several dilute concentrations of glucose (167, 250, and 333 mM) and fructose (167, 250, and 333 mM). In addition, we tested saccharin (38 mM), alone and in binary mixture with each of the sugar concentrations, to manipulate sweet taste intensity while holding caloric value constant. In experiment 1, we measured taste responsiveness to the sweetener solutions in two ways: chorda tympani nerve responses and short-term lick tests. For both measures, the mice exhibited the following relative magnitude of responsiveness: binary mixtures > saccharin > individual sugars. In experiment 2, we asked whether the taste measures reliably predicted daily intake of the sweetener solutions. No such relationship was observed. The glucose solutions elicited weak taste responses but high daily intakes, whereas the fructose solutions elicited weak taste responses and low daily intakes. On the other hand, the saccharin + glucose solutions elicited strong taste responses and high daily intakes, while the saccharin + fructose solutions elicited strong taste responses but low daily intakes. Overall, we found that 1) daily intake of the sweetener solutions varied independently of the magnitude of the taste responses and 2) the solutions containing glucose stimulated substantially higher daily intakes than did the solutions containing isomolar concentrations of fructose. Given prior work demonstrating greater postoral stimulation of feeding by glucose than fructose, we propose that the magnitude of postoral nutritive stimulation plays a more important role than does taste in determining daily intake of dilute sugar solutions.",

The present study investigated this phenomenon by training rats to associate the intake of flavored water with intragastric (IG) infusions of 16% sugar solutions. In experiment 1, rats had one flavor [conditional stimulus (CS)] paired with IG sugar infusions (CS+; e.g., cherry) and another flavor paired with IG water (CS-; e.g., grape) 23 h/day; Chow was available ad libitum. In subsequent choice tests, rats infused with glucose displayed a strong preference (89%) for the CS+ flavor, whereas rats infused with fructose showed only a small and nonreliable CS+ flavor preference (62%). When next trained to associate one flavor (e.g., orange) with IG glucose and another flavor (e.g., strawberry) with IG fructose, rats in both groups developed a significant preference (81%) for the glucose-paired flavor. In experiment 2, food-deprived rats were trained 2 h/day to associate a CS+ flavor with IG sugar and a CS- flavor with IG water infusions. The glucose-reinforced rats displayed a near-total preference (95%) for the CS+ flavor, whereas fructose-reinforced rats showed a much smaller CS+ preference (67%). The preference findings indicate that the postingestive consequences of glucose are much more reinforcing than those of fructose. It appears that food conditioning is mediated by chemospecific actions of nutrients rather than their general satiating or energy repleting effects.",

        "abstract": "Recently, we reported that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a receptor for kokumi substances, which enhance the intensities of salty, sweet and umami tastes. Furthermore, we found that several γ-glutamyl peptides, which are CaSR agonists, are kokumi substances. In this study, we elucidated the receptor cells for kokumi substances, and their physiological properties. For this purpose, we used Calcium Green-1 loaded mouse taste cells in lingual tissue slices and confocal microscopy. Kokumi substances, applied focally around taste pores, induced an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a subset of taste cells. These responses were inhibited by pretreatment with the CaSR inhibitor, NPS2143. However, the kokumi substance-induced responses did not require extracellular Ca2+. CaSR-expressing taste cells are a different subset of cells from the T1R3-expressing umami or sweet taste receptor cells. These observations indicate that CaSR-expressing taste cells are the primary detectors of kokumi substances, and that they are an independent population from the influenced basic taste receptor cells, at least in the case of sweet and umami.",

            "abstract": "The cloning of a G protein-coupled extracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(o)(2+))-sensing receptor (CaR) has elucidated the molecular basis for many of the previously recognized effects of Ca(o)(2+) on tissues that maintain systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, especially parathyroid chief cells and several cells in the kidney. The availability of the cloned CaR enabled the development of DNA and antibody probes for identifying the CaR's mRNA and protein, respectively, within these and other tissues. It also permitted the identification of human diseases resulting from inactivating or activating mutations of the CaR gene and the subsequent generation of mice with targeted disruption of the CaR gene. The characteristic alterations in parathyroid and renal function in these patients and in the mice with \"knockout\" of the CaR gene have provided valuable information on the CaR's physiological roles in these tissues participating in mineral ion homeostasis. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about how the CaR regulates other tissues involved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) homeostasis, particularly bone and intestine. Moreover, there is evidence that additional Ca(o)(2+) sensors may exist in bone cells that mediate some or even all of the known effects of Ca(o)(2+) on these cells. Even more remains to be learned about the CaR's function in the rapidly growing list of cells that express it but are uninvolved in systemic Ca(o)(2+) metabolism. Available data suggest that the receptor serves numerous roles outside of systemic mineral ion homeostasis, ranging from the regulation of hormonal secretion and the activities of various ion channels to the longer term control of gene expression, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and cellular proliferation. In some cases, the CaR on these \"nonhomeostatic\" cells responds to local changes in Ca(o)(2+) taking place within compartments of the extracellular fluid (ECF) that communicate with the outside environment (e.g., the gastrointestinal tract). In others, localized changes in Ca(o)(2+) within the ECF can originate from several mechanisms, including fluxes of calcium ions into or out of cellular or extracellular stores or across epithelium that absorb or secrete Ca(2+). In any event, the CaR and other receptors/sensors for Ca(o)(2+) and probably for other extracellular ions represent versatile regulators of numerous cellular functions and may serve as important therapeutic targets.",

These characteristics are known as “kokumi taste” and often appear in traditional Japanese cuisine. Although GSH is a typical kokumi taste substance (taste enhancer), its mode of action is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate how the kokumi taste is enhanced by the CaSR, a close relative of the class C G-protein-coupled receptors T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 (sweet and umami receptors). We identified a large number of CaSR agonist γ-glutamyl peptides, including GSH (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) and γ-Glu-Val-Gly, and showed that these peptides elicit the kokumi taste. Further analyses revealed that some known CaSR agonists such as Ca2+, protamine, polylysine, l-histidine, and cinacalcet (a calcium-mimetic drug) also elicit the kokumi taste and that the CaSR-specific antagonist, NPS-2143, significantly suppresses the kokumi taste. This is the first report indicating a distinct function of the CaSR in human taste perception.",

In rats with an intact baroreflex, an intravenous bolus of 4 mg/kg anandamide caused a triphasic blood pressure response: transient hypotension, followed by a brief pressor and more prolonged depressor phase. Anandamide evoked a \"primary\" increase in neuronal firing coincident with its pressor effect and a \"secondary,\" baroreflex-mediated rise coincident with its depressor effect at both sites. Pretreatment of rats with phentolamine or trimethaphan did not inhibit either the pressor response or the primary increase in splanchnic nerve discharge elicited by anandamide. In barodenervated rats, electrical stimulation of the rostral ventrolateral medulla increased blood pressure and splanchnic nerve discharge. Anandamide treatment blunted the rise in blood pressure without affecting the increase in splanchnic nerve discharge. Anandamide did not affect the rise in blood pressure in response to an intravenous bolus dose of phenylephrine. The results indicate that (1) the brief pressor response to anandamide is not sympathetically mediated, and (2) the prolonged hypotensive response to anandamide is not initiated in the central nervous system, in ganglia, or at postsynaptic adrenergic receptors but is due to a presynaptic action that inhibits norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve terminals in the heart and vasculature.",

Emulsion autoradiography indicated that binding was associated with both distal tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Intense binding was also found often over juxtaglomerular apparatus.125I-rat CGRP-α exhibited low- to moderate-density binding to the inner medulla/papilla with high-density binding over small-, medium-, and large-caliber arteries. Weak binding to the glomerulus was also seen, but no binding was associated with cortical tubules. Competition binding studies, performed with each of the radioligands, revealed peptide specificity profiles for CGRP and calcitonin receptors that were similar to those described in rat. However, the monkey amylin receptors differed from those in rat, exhibiting relatively higher affinity for calcitonin peptides but reduced affinity for CGRP peptides. These studies suggest potential roles for amylin, calcitonin, and CGRP in primate renal function.",

We previously demonstrated that neuronal CGRP expression is significantly increased in deoxycorticosterone (DOC)-salt hypertensive rats. To determine the hemodynamic role of CGRP in this setting, we used CGRP8-37, a specific CGRP receptor antagonist. DOC-salt hypertension was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats. To control for DOC pellet implantation, left nephrectomy, and/or saline drinking water, we also studied four normotensive groups. Four week after the initiation of each protocol, all rats had intravenous (for drug administration) and arterial (for continuous mean arterial pressure monitoring) catheters surgically placed and were studied in the conscious, unrestrained state. Baseline mean arterial pressure was higher in the DOC-salt than normotensive rats (175 +/- 5 versus 119 +/- 4 mm Hg, P < .001). Vehicle administration did not alter mean arterial pressure in any group, and CGRP8-37 administration (bolus doses of 3.2 x 10(4) or 6.4 x 10(4) pmol/L) did not change mean arterial pressure in the four normotensive groups. However, CGRP8-37 administration to the DOC-salt rats rapidly and significantly increased mean arterial pressure at both the lower dose (9 +/- 1 mm Hg, P < .001) and higher dose (14 +/- 1 mm Hg, P < .001). In addition, the increase in mean arterial pressure between the two CGRP8-37 doses was also significant (P < .01), indicating a dose-dependent response. We conclude that the increase in neuronal CGRP expression in DOC-salt hypertension plays a compensatory vasodilator role to attenuate the elevated blood pressure. These results provide the first conclusive evidence that CGRP plays a direct role in DOC-salt hypertension.",

Baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP, mmHg) was higher (P < 0.05) in Con + A-192621 (122 +/- 4) and ET-1 + A-192621 (119 +/- 4) groups compared with Con (104 +/- 6), ET1 (106 +/- 3), Con + ABT-627 (104 +/- 3), and ET1 + ABT-627 (100 +/- 3) groups. Intravenous administration of CGRP(8-37) (a CGRP receptor antagonist, 1 mg/kg) increased MAP (P < 0.05) in ET-1 (13 +/- 1), Con + A-192621 (12 +/- 1), and ET-1 + A-192621 (15 +/- 3) groups compared with Con (4 +/- 1), Con-ABT-627 (4 +/- 1), and ET-1 + ABT-627 (5 +/- 1) groups. Plasma CGRP levels (in pg/ml) were increased (P < 0.05) in ET-1 (57.5 +/- 6.1), Con + A-192621 (53.9 +/- 3.4), and ET-1 + A-192621 (60.4 +/- 3.0) groups compared with Con (40.4 +/- 1.6), Con + ABT-627 (40.0 +/- 2.9), and ET-1 + ABT-627 (42.6 +/- 1.9) groups. Plasma ET-1 levels (in pg/ml) were higher (P < 0.05) in ET-1 (2.8 +/- 0.2), ET-1 + ABT-627 (3.2 +/- 0.4), Con + A-192621 (3.3 +/- 0.4), and ET-1 + A-192621 (4.6 +/- 0.3) groups compared with Con (1.1 +/- 0.2) and Con-ABT-627 (1.3 +/- 0.2) groups.

Role of dietary salt in hypertension. Journal of the American College of Nutrition 14, 428-438]. Over half of hypertensives are still salt sensitive, i.e., they respond to a high NaCl intake with a rise in blood pressure. This can be ameliorated by restricting NaCl intake, supplementing potassium intake, and consuming diuretics. Some things have changed. We now have more insight into mechanism; we suspected that volume expansion and endogenous Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibitors were the connection between excessive salt intake and the hypertension, but we were not certain as to the nature of the inhibitors. Now it appears that the inhibitors are steroids released from the adrenal gland and are members of the cardenolide family, e.g., ouabain, and the bufadienolide family, e.g., marinobufagenin. This presents new possibilities in therapy, including antibodies to these agents and competitive inhibitors to their binding to Na(+),K(+)-ATPase.",

The structure of this compound, which has been named \"anandamide,\" was determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and was confirmed by synthesis. Anandamide inhibited the specific binding of a radiolabeled cannabinoid probe to synaptosomal membranes in a manner typical of competitive ligands and produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the electrically evoked twitch response to the mouse vas deferens, a characteristic effect of psychotropic cannabinoids. These properties suggest that anandamide may function as a natural ligand for the cannabinoid receptor.",

This polypeptide, infused in saline at 50 pg/min into the abdominal aorta above the renal arteries, produced increases in urine flow, 2.7-3.7 mul/min.g kidney wt (P is less than 0.005); urinary sodium concentration, 32-61 meq/liter (P is less than 0.01); and sodium excretion, 89-223 neq/min (P is less than 0.005). Tubular fluid to plasma inulin concentration ratio measured in the last accessible proximal convolution fell from 2.21 to 1.80 (P is less than 0.001), and thus fractional reabsorption was reduced from 54 to 44% (P is less than 0.001). Absolute reabsorption by the proximal convoluted tubule was also reduced 15.5-12.5 nl/min (P is less than 0.025). In a control series of animals, saline alone infused at the same rate did not produce any statistically significant changes in the measured parameters over the same time period. The intrerenal mechanism responsible for the reduction in proximal reabsorption appears to be a tubular one since no consistent or significant changes were observed in kidney or single nephron glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or intrarenal hydrostatic pressures. No evidence was found to indicate redistribution of filtration rate, or plasma flow, or a reduction in filtration fraction.",
