        "title": "Effect of a six-week dance-based physical education intervention on primary school children’s creativity: A pilot study",
        "abstract": "There is international consensus that creativity is a fundamental outcome of schooling. Opportunities exist to enhance the creativity of schoolchildren, particularly in movement-based subjects such as physical education (PE). In this pilot study, we investigated the effect of a six-week dance-based PE intervention on children’s creativity in a primary school context. Forty second grade students participated in a controlled trial. One class (n = 20) was assigned to the intervention and participated in dance-based PE lessons (10 girls, 10 boys; age 7–8 years). The other class (n = 20) was assigned to the control condition and continued regular PE with no dance (10 girls, 10 boys; age 7–8 years). Pre–post assessment of creativity was obtained through an adapted version of Guilford’s (1967) Alternative Uses task. Data were analysed using linear mixed models, with adjustment made for children’s perceived dance ability and for baseline differences in creativity between groups. The overall effect of the intervention was small (d = 0.36, 95%CI = –0.21 to 0.92), but not statistically significant (p = 0.21). Post-hoc analysis revealed a large difference in the effect of the intervention between children with above and below-average baseline creativity (d = 1.26, 95%CI = 0.14 to 2.39, p = 0.03). Children with above-average creativity at baseline benefitted more (d = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.01 to 1.96, p = 0.047). This pilot study provides further support for the place of dance and creativity within the PE curriculum. However, particular attention should be given to students’ starting points.",

These resided not so much in the complexity of his thought or argument as in his indifference to the conventionsóor, perhaps, the mechanicsóof scholarly writing. Sometimes it is hard to avoid the feeling that his intended reader is himself, to whom he owes no obligation to substantiate anything. He was by no means alone in this practice. Few Urdu writers, until a few decades ago, paid attention to the necessity of a ìcritical apparatusî in a critical text. It was assumed that when one ascribed a statement to a writeróeven if it was not quoted verbatim but only paraphrasedóthere was no reason to falsify or distort. Askari, at least, had no reason to do so. Here, even in a truncated, translated form, the quoted or paraphrased material remains admirably close to the spirit of the original French source, which is rarely fully indicated. He quotes a French poem in his own translation, or sometimes just a line or a few words, without any clue regarding the source. With only the name of the poet to go by, it is exceedingly difficult to trace a fragment in Urdu translation back to its source in French. I have tried my best to locate the sources of such quotations and paraphrased snatches and have also sought help from a few friends. Still some bits of quoted material remain elusive. These instances have been recorded in the footnotes.]",

Here we illustrate how such methods can lead to a much more detailed understanding of group differences than bar graphs and t-tests on means. To complement the neuroscientist’s toolbox, we present two powerful tools that can help us understand how groups of observations differ: the shift function and the difference asymmetry function. These tools can be combined with detailed visualisations to provide complementary perspectives about the data. We provide implementations in R and Matlab of the graphical tools, and all the examples in the article can be reproduced using R scripts.",

In Experiment 1, a verbal protocol analysis study of the Alternative Uses task was carried out with a Think aloud group (N=40) and a Silent control group (N=64). The groups did not differ in fluency or novelty of idea production indicating no verbal overshadowing. Analysis of protocols from the Think aloud group suggested that initial responses were based on a strategy of Retrieval from long-term memory of pre-known uses. Later responses tended to be based on a small number of other strategies: property-use generation, imagined Disassembly of the target object into components and scanning of Broad Use categories for possible uses of the target item. Novelty of uses was particularly associated with the Disassembly strategy. Experiment 2 (N=103) addressed the role of executive processes in generating new and previously known uses by examining individual differences in category fluency, letter fluency and divergent task performance. After completing the task, participants were asked to indicate which of their responses were new for them. It was predicted and found in regression analyses that letter fluency (an executively loading task) was related to production of 'new' uses and category fluency was related to production of 'old' uses but not vice versa.",

The tests administered to the 65 fourth grade subjects consisted of creative thinking tests, a motor creativity battery, and motor skill tests. The following conclusions were drawn: (a) the expression of motor creativity through movement is not related to performance on the selected motor skill items; (b) creativity does not appear to be a generalized trait in as much as significant relationships were not found between the various aspects of creativity; (c) a tendency toward generalization of creativity was found for girls but not for boys; (d) a combination of weight, figural fluency and figural originality accounts for a significant amount of the variability in motor creativity for boys, while a combination of figural and verbal creativity factors does the same for girls; (e) boys of this age perform signific...",

However, little research studied on the psychological impact of improv, with some results highlighting a divergent thinking enhancement in children and adults, but not with teenagers, one of the most important age groups to practice improv. Therefore, this study aims to assess divergent thinking for middle school students before and after an 11-weeks session compared to a control group with a sport practice. The Alternative Uses Task (AUT) was used before and after the session for both groups to evaluate divergent thinking. The improv group had better performance in originality, flexibility and gave less prototypical items after the improv sessions compared to before, while the control group performance was similar before and after. Our results suggest that improv helps teenagers’ divergent thinking to improve, not only with experimental games in the lab context but also after ecological sessions. We urge scientists to study in depth psychological impacts of improvisational theater and applied improvisation, for a better understanding of improv and as a model to study embodied cognition.",

This study categorized the emotion regulation strategies used by preschool children and developed a creativity test which includes the measurement of usefulness, an indicator of creativity that has, until now, been ignored. The main findings are that (a) 6-year-olds outperform 4- and 5-year-olds in terms of creativity; (b) emotion regulation strategies as well as a positive temperament have positive effects on children's creativity; (c) creative drama instruction contributes to children's creativity; and (d) age group, emotion regulation strategies, temperament, and creative drama instruction can collectively predict children's creativity.",

Twenty-two class periods were videotaped, and the tapes were analyzed to determine all correct and incorrect skill trials made by each student each day for the four skills studied. The data analysis included learning trials, learning curves, and achievement. The most consistent result of the statistical analyses was the importance of the total correct trials in determining achievement. For the forearm pass, the serve, and the spike, outside-of-class participation increased the number of total correct trials. The beginning skill level, represented by the pretest score, also influenced achievement. Average trials per day per student were very low, and low-skilled students did not get as many correct or total trials as high-skilled students. Th...",

The added value of external providers in enhancing aspects of children’s learning is supported in the physical education literature. Less is known, however, about the experiences of classroom teachers working with these external providers. To address this gap and guided by the question ‘What are primary school teachers experiences of external providers?’ we conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with primary school classroom teachers who had used external physical education providers (n = 10). A thematic analysis of the data involved systematic coding from which themes were constructed. Findings alert to the limited partnership between classroom teachers and external providers currently. Teachers’ perceptions of external providers as having greater expertise resulted in classroom teachers engaging minimally in communicating with external providers and taking little part in lessons taught by the external provider. Overall findings indicate communication and involvement in pedagogical decision making as areas to address in reconceptualising the relationship between classroom teachers and external providers.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT The enactment of neoliberal ideologies in education, in particular the extension of free-market logics, has the potential to reposition students and affect if and how their voices are elicited and responded to. There is, however, a dearth of research that seeks to understand how students are experiencing neoliberal influences on their education. Given the various and far-reaching effects of neoliberalisation on education, one specific neoliberal practice, namely the outsourcing of curriculum work to external providers within a singular curricular subject, was selected to be explored. In this paper we present an analysis and theorisation of students’ positioning in, and perspectives of, outsourced health and physical education (HPE) in one secondary school. We utilise Bernstein’s sociology of pedagogic voice to assist in our analysis. Data were generated at an independent, co-educational secondary school in Australia through focus groups with 25 Year 8 students, interviews with school staff, and observations of externally provided lessons. Our analysis revealed significant pedagogical and ethical issues relating to teaching and learning in externally provided HPE classes. We argue that more empirical research and better theorisation around students’ experiences in, and opinions of, neo-HPE is necessary in order to protect the educative and socially just intent of the subject.",

It is a valuable learning tool that utilizes principles from the science of learning and serious computer games. Students learn the skills of scientific reasoning by engaging in interactive dialogs with avatars. They are tutored by avatars with tutoring sessions that vary depending on how well students have responded to questions about the material they are learning. Students also play a jeopardy-like game against a feisty avatar to identify flaws in research and then generate their own questions to determine the quality of different types of research. The research examples are taken from psychology, biology, and chemistry to help students transfer the thinking skills across domains of knowledge.

The suggested method combines an explicit learning theory with robust methodological steps in order to explore aspects of learning in school physical education. The design of the study is based on sociocultural learning theory, and the approach adds to previous research within the field, both in terms of the combination of methods used and the claims made in our studies. The paper describes a way of collecting and analysing the retrieved data and discusses and illustrates the results of a study using this combination of explicit learning theory and robust methodological steps.",

            "abstract": "The Role of Velocity in Affect Discrimination Helena M. Paterson (helena@psy.gla.ac.uk) Glasgow, G12 8QB Frank E. Pollick (frank@psy.gla.ac.uk) Department of Psychology, 58 Hillhead Street, Glasgow, G12 8QB Anthony J. Sanford (tony@psy.gla.ac.uk) Department of Psychology, 58 Hillhead Street, Glasgow, G12 8QB Abstract Two experiments are described that examine the role of speed in the categorisation of affective biological motion displays. For the first experiment movements were recorded for 10 affects and the point-light animations of them were shown to participants in a recognition task. The resultant confusion matrices were analysed using the ALSCAL multi-dimensional scaling procedure and produced a 2-dimensional psychological space. The psychological space for discrimination was similar to that from recent models of experienced affect in that the first dimension corresponded to the activation dimension from these models. A strong correlation between the movement speed and the activation dimension confirmed the finding. From these results it would appear that the mapping between stimulus properties and representation of activation in affect is a fairly direct one. For the second experiment more sad, angry and neutral movements were collected. New movements of different duration, but identical spatial displacement were made using an interpolation algorithm. Observers viewed the movements as point light displays and heir task was to rate intensity of affect. Results from this experiment indicate speed plays a major role in modulating the intensity of activation in perceived affect. Introduction Humans can easily tell each other apart and interpret subtle differences in behaviour that communicates intentions, identity and emotions easily. Cues from facial features are used for much of this recognition, however, highly impoverished stimuli - such as point- light displays - convey sufficient information for the recognition of such person properties (Barclay, Cutting & Kozlowski, 1978, Cutting & Kozlowski, 1977; Dittrich, Troscianko, Lea & Morgan, 1986; Hill & Pollick, 2000; Kozlowski & Cutting, 1978; Mather & Murdoch, 1994; Runeson & Frykholm, 1981; Runeson & Frykholm, 1983; Walk & Homan, 1984). The cues that convey this information in biological motion are of primary interest to us and using point light displays of human arm movements, we have concentrated on the recognition of emotion from biological motion. In exploring the way in which humans recognise affect, it is possible not only to look at the accuracy with which an affect is recognised, but also at the structure of the representation of affect. A number of models for the structure of experienced affect have been suggested that resemble each other in a number of factors (Russell, 1980; Watson and Tellegen, 1985; Thayer, 1989, Larsen and Diener; 1992; Feldman, Barrett and Russell, 1999). The similarities between these models are that the structure of affect is a two- dimensional and continuous structure. This structure is referred to as a circumplex model (Feldman, Barrett and Russell, 1999). The two dimensions of the circumplex models are bipolar and independent. One dimension represents valence (for instance hedonic tone, pleasant – unpleasant) and the other, arousal or activation (arousal – sleep/ activated – deactivated). The models are also continuous, with affects falling on a circle, centred on the origin of the psychological space defined by the two dimensions. Although these models were established as representing one’s own experience of affect, there is recent evident to suggest that experience and perception interact when observing another person’s actions (Decety and Grezes, 1999; Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Gallese and Foggassi, 1996). Additionally biological motion relies on both specialised bottom-up processes of motion detection (Mather, Radford and West, 1992; Neri, Morrone and Burr, 1998) and interactions between these and top-down processes (Shiffrar and Freyd, 1990, 1993; Thornton, Pinto and Shiffrar, 1998). In the case of affect perception such a top-down process may well originate from the influence of an internal structure of affect. It seems reasonable, therefore, to further explore the possible relationship between perception and structure of affect. There is also, currently, little research that concentrates specifically at the recognition of emotion",

In Study 1, 686 Japanese subjects rated 40 posture expressions on sixteen 5-point semantic differential scale items. Subjects inferred an encoder's attitude towards oneself (i.e., the decoding subject) in hypothetical dyadic situations. A principal-component factor analysis yielded evidence for three independent dimensions resembling those proposed by Schlosberg (1954), Osgood (1966), and Williams and Sundene (1965). These three factors were named self-fulfillment, interpersonal positiveness, and interpersonal consciousness. In Study 2, 336 Japanese students again rated the 40 posture expressions on the sixteen 5-point differential items, but an attempt was made to control for the status of the hypothetical encoder. The results of this study essentially replicated those of Study 1. One interesting finding was that although we found the same factors as those found in studies conducted in the West, the order of the factors in our studies was the reverse of the order found in these previous studies. The findings are discussed in terms of proposed cultural differences in the maintenance of human relations.",

Collected affect data has to be further annotated in order to become usable for the automated systems. Most of the existing studies of emotion or affect annotation are monomodal. Instead, in this paper, we explore how independent human observers annotate affect display from monomodal face data compared to bimodal face-and-body data. To this aim we collected visual affect data by recording the face and face-and-body simultaneously. We then conducted a survey by asking human observers to view and label the face and face-and-body recordings separately. The results obtained show that in general, viewing face-and-body simultaneously helps with resolving the ambiguity in annotating emotional behaviours.",

To this date, investigations of emotional cognition have predominantly concentrated on processes associated with viewing facial expressions. However, expressive body movements may be just as important for understanding the neurobiology of emotional behavior. Here, we used functional MRI to clarify how the brain recognizes happiness or fear expressed by a whole body. Our results indicate that observing fearful body expressions produces increased activity in brain areas narrowly associated with emotional processes and that this emotion-related activity occurs together with activation of areas linked with representation of action and movement. The mechanism of fear contagion hereby suggested may automatically prepare the brain for action.",

Their perceptual judgments are based on simple movement features, such as overall speed, but also on more intricate posture and dynamic cues. The systematic analysis of such features is complicated due to the difficulty of considering the large number of potentially relevant kinematic and dynamic parameters. To identify emotion-specific features we motion-captured the neutral and emotionally expressive (anger, happiness, sadness, fear) gaits of 25 individuals. Body posture was characterized by average flexion angles, and a low-dimensional parameterization of the spatio-temporal structure of joint trajectories was obtained by approximation with a nonlinear mixture model. Applying sparse regression, we extracted critical emotion-specific posture and movement features, which typically depended only on a small number of joints. The features we extracted from the motor behavior closely resembled features that were critical for the perception of emotion from gait, determined by a statistical analysis of classification and rating judgments of 21 observers presented with avatars animated with the recorded movements. The perceptual relevance of these features was further supported by another experiment showing that artificial walkers containing only the critical features induced high-level after-effects matching those induced by adaptation with natural emotional walkers.",

This article also shows that his many other qualms about other aspects of the design of the studies of literate cultures have no merit. Russell's critique of the preliterate cultures is inaccurate; he does not fully disclose what those who studied preliterate subjects did or what they concluded that they had found. Taking account of all of Russell's qualms, my analysis shows that the evidence from both literate and preliterate cultures is overwhelming in support of universals in facial expressions.",

This movement is related to both the musical score execution and the emotional intention conveyed. In this experiment, a pianist was asked to play the same excerpt with different emotionally expressive intentions. The aim was to verify whether different expressions could be distinguished based on movement by trying to determine which motion cues were most emotion-sensitive. Analyses were performed via an automated system capable of detecting the temporal profiles of two motion cues: the quantity of motion of the upper body and the velocity of head movements. Results showed that both were sensitive to emotional expression, especially the velocity of head movements. Further, some features conveying information about movement temporal dynamics varied among expressive conditions allowing emotion discrimination. These results are in line with recent theories that underlie the dynamic nature of emotional expression.",

She has difficulty detecting the movement or coding the velocity of single moving dots. Nevertheless, we find that she can report human actions in Johansson “biological motion ”; displays. This requires the accurate coding of the direction and velocity of many moving dots. The implication is that structure can be extracted from motion in regions of visual cortex other than those traditionally associated with motion processing. However, she cannot report the spatial disposition of the actors whose actions she has recognized, not their movement in depth relative to her. A possible interpretation is that coding in these additional regions is primarily object-centred. Adding a small number of random stationary “noise” dots to the display prevents her from identifying the actions, suggesting that segregation by motion is implemented within the...",

            "abstract": "What is the relation between gestures and speech? In terms of symbolic forms, of course, the spontaneous and unwitting gestures we make while talking differ sharply from spoken language itself. Whereas spoken language is linear, segmented, standardized, and arbitrary, gestures are global, synthetic, idiosyncratic, and imagistic. In Hand and Mind, David McNeill presents a bold theory of the essential unity of speech and the gestures that accompany it. This long-awaited, provocative study argues that the unity of gestures and language far exceeds the surface level of speech noted by previous researchers and in fact also includes the semantic and pragmatic levels of language. In effect, the whole concept of language must be altered to take into account the nonsegmented, instantaneous, and holistic images conveyed by gestures. McNeill and his colleagues carefully devised a standard methodology for examining the speech and gesture behavior of individuals engaged in narrative discourse. A research subject is shown a cartoon like the 1950 Canary Row--a classic Sylvester and Tweedy Bird caper that features Sylvester climbing up a downspout, swallowing a bowling ball and slamming into a brick wall. After watching the cartoon, the subject is videotaped recounting the story from memory to a listener who has not seen the cartoon. Painstaking analysis of the videotapes revealed that although the research subjects--children as well as adults, some neurologically impaired--represented a wide variety of linguistic groupings, the gestures of people speaking English and a half dozen other languages manifest the same principles. Relying on data from more than ten years of research, McNeill shows thatgestures do not simply form a part of what is said and meant but have an impact on thought itself. He persuasively argues that because gestures directly transfer mental images to visible forms, conveying ideas that language cannot always express, we must examine language and gesture",

            "abstract": "This article addresses methodological issues pertinent to judgment studies in nonverbal communication research, in general, and to the perception and attribution of emotions, in particular. We investigated which behavioral cues are used in portraying various emotions and to what extent the channel of presentation and encoding differences between actors affect judgment accuracy. In an encoding study the nonverbal behaviors of 6 different actors (3 male, 3 female) portraying four emotions (joy, sadness, anger, surprise) were analyzed from a videotape. In a decoding study these portrayals were shown using 4 channels of presentation (audio-video, video only, audio only, filtered audio), to groups of naive judges. The results indicate that different nonverbal cues are used to portray the various emotions and that differences between channels and between actors strongly affect decoding accuracy. Specifically, overemphasis of behavioral cues characteristic for certain emotions results in reduced decoding accuracy. Given the widespread assumption that nonverbal signal systems are particularly suitable for communicating affective information, it is not surprising that many researchers have attempted to study how well individuals can recognize different emotions from various nonverbal cues (for an overview of such studies, see Ekman, 1982; Scherer, 1981). One of the major obstades researchers have encountered in this area has been the problem of obtaining realistic stimulus material to present to judges; that is, obtaining nonverbal expressions that represent valid indicators of various emotional states. The ethical and practical difficulties in experimentally inducing strong emotional states, or even recording naturally occurring emotional experiences, has been one of the perennial problems in the scientific study of emotion. In studying the role of vocal cues in the communication of emotional meaning, this difficulty is aggravated because the researcher, in order to avoid interference from verbal content, usually wants to use standard verbal utterances with the same content for different emotions so as to focus on the different paralinguistic cues that carry the emotional meaning. Given these constraints, most researchers have taken recourse to emotional expression simulated or portrayed by actors using standard verbal material such as standard sentences, nonsense syllables, letters of the alphabet, and the like (see summary in",

        "title": "‘Free but not free-free’: teaching creative aspects of dance in physical education teacher education",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background There is a global consensus that stimulating and fostering children’s creativity in education is crucial. Addressing creativity has become an imperative in educational policies and in school curricula internationally. School-based physical education (PE), and specifically the teaching area of dance, has been identified as an important pedagogical setting within which to develop creativity. Existing studies have suggested, however, that dance is seldom taught in PE in ways that acknowledge creative aspects of movement learning. Scholars have claimed that teaching pre-arranged dances with predetermined movement outcomes dominate dance teaching in PE. Furthermore, studies have asserted that the overarching regulative principles of PE and PETE that privilege sport skills and physical exercise hinder creative movement learning. Still, dance teaching is frequently seen as part of expressive dance teaching in PE and PETE and is regarded as holding potential in the area of education for creativity. Little scholarly attention has been given to how teacher educators approach creative aspects in dance teaching. Purpose This article aims to create insights into how PETE teacher educators understand and work with creative aspects of dance in their educational practice. Method and theory To address our aim, we investigate how teacher educators describe their teaching of creative aspects of dance. To do this, empirical material was generated through qualitative interviews with PE teacher educators from each of the PETE institutions in Sweden. The theoretical concepts of smooth and striated spaces and experimentation by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari were used to guide the analysis of how the PETE educators described their teaching of creative aspects of dance. Deleuze and Guattari developed a framework that concerned questions of creativity and newness. Despite this conceptual framework having not yet been used in dance education in PE and PETE, their writing fits well when analysing questions of creativity in an educational context. Findings We identified three major themes relating to creativity in the empirical material: (a) creative aspects of expressive dance; (b) challenges that teacher educators face when introducing movement exploration in expressive dance to their students, and; (c) the teacher educators’ pedagogical work with students. Discussion The results of this study show that teaching expressive dance can take teaching in PE and PETE in new directions. The results provide insights into alternative ways of teaching in these educational settings that can counter the dominant ways of teaching dance. Results suggest that teacher educators operate in various striated spaces that are shaped by expectations and conventions. In such spaces, the educators aim to create momentary passages of smoothening that open up for experimentation and the development of students’ creativity. The results also suggest that expressive dance in PE and PETE emphasizes creative movement learning through which students learn to operate within new and unpredictable situations.",

            "Adkins (2015) questions Deleuze and Guattari’s use of the term noting that movement is typically seen as the defining characteristic of nomads. Here, Deleuze and Guattari (1987) distinguish the nomad from the migrant. The migrant is someone who goes from one point to another, where the first point is a familiar one and the second point uncertain and unforeseen. With the migrant, striated spaces are disrupted and momentary passages of smoothening emerge that allow for the flow of unpredictable movement (Rosenlund Hansen, Weinreich Hansen, and Kristensen 2017; Johansson 2015). The nomad, in contrast, rests in the smooth space without any specific trajectories for movement (Deleuze and Guattari 1987). A second central concept borrowed from the Deleuzeguattarian theoretical framework for this study is experimentation (May 2005). In putting forth an experimental philosophy, Deleuze and Guattari proclaim that for one to reach full creative potential, one must ‘lodge [one’s] self on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 161). Olsson (2009) notes that the Deleuzeguattarian notion of experimentation differs from the positivist idea of experimentation as controlling parameters and working towards an expected outcome. She argues that experimentation suggests a way for preschool teachers to work whereby the children’s subjectivity and learning are seen as never really possible to predict, control, supervise or evaluate against predefined goals. Like Olsson, Johansson (2015) challenges preconceptions and limitations in pedagogical contexts by acknowledging what she terms as the ‘not-yet seen’ in educational practices.",

May (2005) concurs with Olsson and Johansson, adding that creativity is central to experimentation and that to experiment is to act without any assurance about the results of one’s experimenting. In May’s reading of Deleuze (2005), experimentation is never finished; one does not reach a state where a creative process is exhausted: ‘there is always more [to experiment with]’ (172).",

Here, Deleuze and Guattari (1987) distinguish the nomad from the migrant. The migrant is someone who goes from one point to another, where the first point is a familiar one and the second point uncertain and unforeseen. With the migrant, striated spaces are disrupted and momentary passages of smoothening emerge that allow for the flow of unpredictable movement (Rosenlund Hansen, Weinreich Hansen, and Kristensen 2017; Johansson 2015). The nomad, in contrast, rests in the smooth space without any specific trajectories for movement (Deleuze and Guattari 1987). A second central concept borrowed from the Deleuzeguattarian theoretical framework for this study is experimentation (May 2005). In putting forth an experimental philosophy, Deleuze and Guattari proclaim that for one to reach full creative potential, one must ‘lodge [one’s] self on a stratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 161). Olsson (2009) notes that the Deleuzeguattarian notion of experimentation differs from the positivist idea of experimentation as controlling parameters and working towards an expected outcome. She argues that experimentation suggests a way for preschool teachers to work whereby the children’s subjectivity and learning are seen as never really possible to predict, control, supervise or evaluate against predefined goals. Like Olsson, Johansson (2015) challenges preconceptions and limitations in pedagogical contexts by acknowledging what she terms as the ‘not-yet seen’ in educational practices. May (2005) concurs with Olsson and Johansson, adding that creativity is central to experimentation and that to experiment is to act without any assurance about the results of one’s experimenting."

What is a body without organs? What is becoming-animal? Brent Adkins demonstrates that all the questions raised by A Thousand Plateaus are in service to Deleuze and Guattari's radical reconstruction of the methods and aims of philosophy itself. To achieve this he argues that the crucial term for understanding A Thousand Plateaus is 'assemblage.' An assemblage is Deleuze and Guattari's answer to the perennial philosophical question, \"What is a thing?\" and they assert that assemblages are always found on a continuum between stasis and change. Each plateau is therefore concerned with a particular type of assemblage (e.g. social, political, linguistic) and its tendencies toward both stasis and change.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Research has indicated that an aesthetic perspective on movement is lacking in physical education and that exploratory teaching assignments are rare. Purpose: The aim of the paper is to explore how PE teachers approach the issue of teaching expressive dance and which learning processes students are involved in while dancing. Participants, research design and data collection: Sixty-eight students from three different secondary school classes and four PE teachers at one municipal school in Sweden participated in a pedagogical intervention. A dance education unit built around Rudolf Laban’s framework of movement was video recorded. Careful attention was paid to ethical considerations. Data analysis: Using Dewey’s transactional perspective as a holistic starting point contributed to dissolve the dualism between individuals and the environment (1949/1991). The analysis was informed by practical epistemology analysis [Wickman, P.-O., and L. Östman. 2002. “Learning as a Discourse Change: a Sociocultural Mechanism.” Science Education 86 (5): 601–623], where the terms gaps, relations and encounters were applied to distinguish various types of transactions. The concept of risk [Biesta, G. 2013. The Beautiful Risk of Education. Boulder: Paradigm Publishers] was utilised to explore how teachers’ pedagogical methods interacted with the environment in the pedagogical intervention. Findings: Most transactions occurring during the dance unit were interpreted as narrow transactions, meaning that the students’ actions followed responses to the teachers’ initiation of a dance assignment. Expanded transactions occurred when the students were given the opportunity and responsibility to find their own solutions to dance assignments. This is interpreted as leading to an expanded purpose, which involves new ways of moving. Interrupted transactions, i.e. when actions were stopped and no encounters occurred, were observed in the form of students hesitating or avoiding participation. Teaching methods involving a certain degree of risk enable creative and non-predetermined movements. The use of unfamiliar music avoided a reproduction of stereotypical dance styles. Dimmed lighting in the sports hall and the opportunity to work in separate rooms helped the students negotiating environmental risks by attending to the organisation and aesthetics of the space. Conclusions: Expressive dance assignments can take teaching in PE in new and expanded directions. The teachers programmed gradually more risks into their lessons, which in line with Biesta’s understanding (2013) enabled the students to explore new and unpredictable movements. The students developed new ways of expressing themselves and were able to focus on the meaning of the movements. Expressive dance assignments are well suited to an exploratory method of teaching and this interplay can challenge existing logics of competition and ranking in PE.",

            "abstract": "There is international consensus that creativity is a fundamental outcome of schooling. Opportunities exist to enhance the creativity of schoolchildren, particularly in movement-based subjects such as physical education (PE). In this pilot study, we investigated the effect of a six-week dance-based PE intervention on children’s creativity in a primary school context. Forty second grade students participated in a controlled trial. One class (n = 20) was assigned to the intervention and participated in dance-based PE lessons (10 girls, 10 boys; age 7–8 years). The other class (n = 20) was assigned to the control condition and continued regular PE with no dance (10 girls, 10 boys; age 7–8 years). Pre–post assessment of creativity was obtained through an adapted version of Guilford’s (1967) Alternative Uses task. Data were analysed using linear mixed models, with adjustment made for children’s perceived dance ability and for baseline differences in creativity between groups. The overall effect of the intervention was small (d = 0.36, 95%CI = –0.21 to 0.92), but not statistically significant (p = 0.21). Post-hoc analysis revealed a large difference in the effect of the intervention between children with above and below-average baseline creativity (d = 1.26, 95%CI = 0.14 to 2.39, p = 0.03). Children with above-average creativity at baseline benefitted more (d = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.01 to 1.96, p = 0.047). This pilot study provides further support for the place of dance and creativity within the PE curriculum. However, particular attention should be given to students’ starting points.",

These transforms are conjoint spatial/spectral representations, which provide a complete image description in terms of locally windowed 2-D spectral coordinates embedded within global 2-D spatial coordinates. In the present neural network approach, based on interlaminar interactions involving two layers with fixed weights and one layer with adjustable weights, the network finds coefficients for complete conjoint 2-D Gabor transforms without restrictive conditions. In wavelet expansions based on a biologically inspired log-polar ensemble of dilations, rotations, and translations of a single underlying 2-D Gabor wavelet template, image compression is illustrated with ratios up to 20:1. Also demonstrated is image segmentation based on the clustering of coefficients in the complete 2-D Gabor transform. >",

We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is taster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show how our technique can be adapted tor use in a stereo vision system.",

            "title": "Timing sensory integration for robot simulation of autistic behavior",
            "abstract": "UTISM is the most common condition in a group of developmental disorders known as the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) [42]. It is characterized by impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and unusual, repetitive, behaviors and interests. Movement disturbance symptoms in individuals with autism have long not been considered an important symptom. During the last decade, Leary and Hill [4] have offered a radical perspective on this subject. After thorough analysis of the bibliography on movement impairments in autism they outlined how deficits in movement preparation and execution could lead to many of the behaviors exhibited by individuals with autism. Difficulties in planning and executing simple discrete movements, can lead to problems in learning to coordinate diverse muscle groups into a unitary movement pattern. Moreover, when a person is unable to respond to another’s action in a timely fashion they will miss the positive reinforcement associated with interpersonal interaction. Behavioral evidence of human perception and action indicates that organisms make use of multisensory stimulation. Under normal circumstances, multisensory stimulation leads to enhanced perceptions of, and facilitated responses to, objects in the environment (e.g. [5][6][7]). But literature shows that imprecise grasping or other motor or executive dysfunctions observed in autistic patients are caused by a disturbance in a dynamic mechanism that involves multisensory processing and integration. This can be caused by discrepancies between stimuli that are normally concordant. In these circumstances, multisensory stimulation actually leads to inaccurate perceptions and responses, regarding location, identity, and timing. Temporal binding for instance is identified as a dynamic mechanism that is disrupted and likely implicated in the perceptual as well as higher order deficits observed in autism (Brock et al. [8]). In other studies, atypical processing is specifically associated with enhanced sensory processing or discrimination in various modalities [9][10][11]. Some studies argue for a broader neurological problem such as an executive function deficit in the coordination of sources of information from different modalities [12][13][14]. All these works suggest that the dynamic aspects of integration of multisensory input influences the forming of coherent perception, planning, and coordination of action. Even more concrete, many studies assume that simple motor planning is intact but that the use of externally guided visual feedback is diminished, affecting the quality of motor performance, postural stability, and the lack of effective sequencing of actions [15][16][17][18]. Thus, perceptually challenging tasks that require smooth integration of visual with vestibular-proprioceptive information, for example, may be particularly difficult to perform and could result in poor quality of motor performance on complex tasks. We test this assumption by simulating the dynamic mechanism of temporal multisensory integration in order to investigate how the atypical forming of coherent perception might influence coordination of action, and compare the results with experimental studies by typical and autistic patients. Temporal multisensory integration has previously been discussed in the context of autism in [8] [19] in attempts to obtain a clear understanding of the underlying biological mechanism of interaction and to simulate it in [20][21] in the robotics setting in [22][23], and implicitly in many other robotics studies. Masterton and Biederman [15] in particular have shown that a proper interplay between integration of distal (visual) and proximal (proprioceptive) cues is essential by grasping. We simulate the integration of these cues on a mobile robot in a two-dimensional plane. A very important point is that the integration process that causes the movement behavior is approximated by a dynamic mechanism. Proper modeling of dynamic (or temporal) integration mechanisms requires a dynamic neural model. The mainstream connectionist methods such as self-organizing or supervised feed-forward networks, and Hopfield type recurrent networks, produce static outputs because their internal dynamics lack feedback loops, and their input space is static. Therefore they are suitable for modeling static behaviors. We are interested in a neural system that can spontaneously exhibit several dynamic behaviors derived from the interaction between changing input and complex inner dynamics. However, for the sake of controllability and computational expense, we have chosen the model that requires the least complexity. Schöner and colleagues [2[2][23][24] have adapted the dynamic neural field model of Amari [1] for controlling mobile robots and robot-manipulators. It produces smooth behavioral trajectories satisfying more than one external variable. In this model the Timing sensory integration for robot simulation of autistic behavior",

            "abstract": "In this paper, I would like to emphasize the developmental role of imitation as a foundation for the emergence of a sense of agency (i.e. a sense of being the owner of one’s own action). There is a large body of psychological and neuroimaging experiments that have demonstrated that perception of action share some common neural and cognitive mechanisms with action generation, action simulation, action recognition and action imitation. How the concept of shared motor representations relate to neonatal imitation is of major interest. Indeed, primary wired perceptualmotor coupling may be viewed as primitives of imitation which could play a main constitutive role in the establishment of a distinction between action originating from self and action originating from others. We will show that 2-month-olds do not imitate a selfpropelled robotic mouth protruding its tongue, while they do imitate a human tongue protrusion. This suggests that imitation is already selective of human action. Young infants select biological movements among all moving stimuli that are similar in speed, colour and morphology. Similarly, be imitated may be viewed as an actionperception coupling which may strongly contribute to distinguish between self-agency and other’s agency. In her first developmental steps, the very young infant may take the behaviour seen as being hers, which could result in reciprocal imitation if the movement seen does not match exactly the movement done. Through imitation, this will lead the infant to distinguish between two classes of perception that Russell proposes to be at the origin of the sense of agency: those perceptions that are a byproduct of one’s own action and intention, and perceptions coming from the external world, that you cannot modify at will. Comparing 2-month-olds’ behavior with a device allowing to present with a seamless shift contingent image and voice of the mother or delayed image and/or voice of the mother, we found 10 times more imitation in the contingent episode, where infant and mother can reciprocate imitation rounds. In addition, a high positive correlation between number of mother’s imitation and number of infant’s imitation was found. This suggests that imFigure 1: The teleprompter device used to delay im-",

These models have been successfully applied to the understanding of the different types of impairment that can exist in neuropsychological patients. In the present study, aspects of face processing in psychiatric patients were investigated in relation to Bruce & Young's (1986) model. Based on this functional model different predictions can be made. We contrast here the impaired expression analysis hypothesis, which is that psychiatric patients would show a deficit in facial expression recognition, but not in facial identity recognition or unfamiliar face matching, with the generalized deficit hypothesis, that patients would be impaired on all tasks. These hypotheses were examined using three forced-choice tasks (facial recognition, facial expression recognition, and unfamiliar face matching) which were presented to schizophrenic and depressed patients, and to non-patient controls. Results showed that schizophrenic patients performed at a significantly lower level than non-patient controls on all three tasks, supporting the generalized deficit hypothesis.",

The proposed alignment links anger to autonomy (individual rights violations), contempt to community (violation of communal codes including hierarchy), and disgust to divinity (violations of purity-sanctity). This is the CAD triad hypothesis. Students in the United States and Japan were presented with descriptions of situations that involve 1 of the types of moral violations and asked to assign either an appropriate facial expression (from a set of 6) or an appropriate word (contempt, anger, disgust, or their translations). Results generally supported the CAD triad hypothesis. Results were further confirmed by analysis of facial expressions actually made by Americans to the descriptions of these situations.",

In conventional tasks intended to explore the perception of age, sex, unfamiliar face identity (Benton test) and gaze direction from the face, the Huntington's disease group showed a borderline impairment of gaze direction perception and were significantly impaired on unfamiliar face matching. With a separate set of tasks using computerinterpolated ('morphed') facial images, people with Huntington's disease were markedly impaired at discriminating anger from fear, but experienced less difficulty with continua varying from male to female, between familiar identities, and from happiness to sadness. In a further test of recognition of facial expressions of basic emotions from the Ekman and Friesen (1976) series, interpolated images were created for six continua that lay around the perimeter of an emotion hexagon (happiness-surprise; surprise-fear; fear-sadness; sadness-disgust; disgust-anger; anger-happiness). In deciding which emotion these morphed images were most like, people with Huntington's disease again showed deficits in the recognition of anger and fear, and an especially severe problem with disgust, which was recognized only at chance level. A follow-up study with tests of facially and vocally expressed emotions confirmed that the recognition of disgust was markedly poor for the Huntington's disease group, still being no better than chance level. Questionnaires were also used to examine self-assessed emotion, but did not show such striking problems. Taken together, these data reveal severe impairments of emotion recognition in Huntington's disease, and show that the recognition of some emotions is more impaired than others. The possibility that certain basic emotions may have dedicated neural substrates needs to be seriously considered: among these, disgust is a prime candidate.",

Schizophrenic patients' performance was significantly poorer than that of depressed patients and non-patient controls. Significantly lower scores were obtained on the facial expression recognition task than on the familiar face recognition task. There was a differential pattern of group performance on each of the three tasks: schizophrenic and depressed patients were as accurate as non-patient controls on the familiar face recognition task, but significantly less accurate than non-patient controls on the unfamiliar face-matching task. Schizophrenic patients were significantly less accurate than depressed patients and non-patient controls on the facial expression recognition task.

            "Second, Wallbott (1998) found that various emotions portrayed in FL video clips of whole-body movements can be differentiated from each other according to a combination of specific patterns of movements and the vigour or quality of those movements. The third relevant study is Pollick et al's (2001b), in which participants classified the emotions in PL knocking and drinking arm movements.",
            "The consensus is now that many emotions are indeed differentiated both by characteristic body movements and by static postures (Aronoff et al 1992; De Meijer 1989; Wallbott 1998), and that these are effective cues for judging the emotional states of other people in the absence of facial and vocal cues (eg Brownlow et al 1997; De Meijer 1989, 1991; Dittrich 1991; Dittrich et al 1996; Walk and Homan 1984). An interesting application of such regularities between movement patterns and emotions has recently been used in attempts to change the design and behaviour of robots (Breazeal 2002). As indicated above, body posture and movement stimuli have rarely been used in investigations of emotion perception in clinical populations, and they have been used in only one functional-imaging study of emotion perception. Early indications are that bilateral amygdala damage can disrupt the ability to recognise fear expressed in FL static body postures (Sprengelmeyer et al 1999). However, there has not yet been a systematic study of patients with bilateral amygdala lesions that has used a single set of stimuli consisting of both dynamic and static body expressions in both PL and FL conditions. Nor are there any reports of people with disgust-recognition deficits for static faces being tested with either static or dynamic body expressions. Hadjikhani and de Gelder (2003) functional-imaging study found amygdala and fusiform cortex activation to static, FL fearful compared to neutral body expressions.",
            "With respect to the PL-stills conditions, it is clear that classification accuracy was higher in the present study than in Walters and Walk's (1988) study for all 5 emotions (mean difference  12.9%), with expressions of sadness showing the greatest difference (19.6%), closely followed by expressions of fear and happiness (with differences of 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively). Nevertheless, the relative performance across emotions for the PL stills in these two studies was similar, with disgust expressions being the most poorly recognised (below chance) and happiness being the best recognised. The overall better performance of our participants for PL stills is likely to be attributable, at least in part, to the different nature of the PL stills in the two studies. Walters and Walk's PL-stills stimuli consisted of photographic slides of PL video images displayed on a black-and-white monitor, taken with a long exposure, thus revealing the paths tracked by the white patches as the actor moved. Our own PL stills, in contrast, were freeze-frame images from the judged peak of each expression that contained minimal blurring and minimal information about movement trajectories. The finding in two separate studies that emotional expressions can be correctly categorised significantly above chance from static PL displays is interesting, given that people typically cannot recognise still PL displays as human figures (Johansson 1973). The findings of Walters and Walk (1988) and the present study suggest that when participants are told that the PL displays depict human-body postures, it is possible for 738 A P Atkinson, W H Dittrich, A J Gemmell, A W Young",

            "] In contrast to previous studies, strips were placed on the hands rather than the wrists because the results of Wallbott's (1998) examination of body expressions indicated that hand postures and movements were one of the most significant characteristics for distinguishing between emotions.",
            "Our results confirm findings (eg Dittrich 1991; Dittrich et al 1996; Wallbott 1998) that human-movement information can convey information about emotional body expressions. Furthermore, the overall result that recognition success clearly differed for individual emotions corroborates these earlier results about the importance of distinguishing differences in movement characteristics for different emotional expressions. The error confusion dendrogram for FL conditions is in keeping with earlier findings on emotional clustering (eg Dittrich et al 1996; Scherer et al 1986). As Dittrich (1999) argued, however, one should not rule out additional cognitive factors such as feature selection, familiarity, or typicality that could also play a role in biological-motion recognition.",
            "According to Wallbott's scheme, body expressions of both disgust and sadness involve passive, lowactivity movements with low energy or power. More specific movements that Wallbott found were common in expressing these two emotions were moving the shoulders forward, and moving the head downward, both of which were frequent occurrences in our actors' portrayals. Yet Wallbott's actors often crossed their arms in front of their body when expressing disgust but not sadness, whereas our actors tended to do the converse. Our results showed that expressions of disgust were also often confused with expressions of anger and fear, more so in the PL than in the FL displays. Dittrich et al (1996) also found that disgust and fear were quite highly confusable, but disgust and anger rather less so.",

Les resultats montrent que l'expression est conditionee par (1) une attitude (Einstellung) de l'observateur, c'est-a-dire, la posture peut etre prise comme une expression d'une fonction ou d'un etat mental, ou elle peut etre prise comme une phase d'un mouvement; (2) une situation que fournit l'observateur, si l'experimentateur ne la fournit pas; (3) la nature de la posture elle-meme. Ces trois conditions sont cependant dependantes l'une de l'autre. Puisque dans nos conditions l'attitude et la situation sont fournies par l'observateur, nulle posture n'est equivoque dans son expression. Les expressions spec...",

Results indicated that diagonal and angular body patterns convey threat, whereas round body patterns convey warmth. In a 2nd study, a set of 3 experiments using models of simple geometric patterns revealed that acute angles with downward pointing vertices conveyed the meaning of threat and that roundedness conveyed the meaning of warmth. Human facial features exhibit these same geometric properties in displays of anger and happiness",

        "abstract": "As they are mainly based on bodily experiences and embodied knowledge, dance and movement practices present a great diversity and complexity across genre and context. Thus, developing a conceptual framework for archiving, managing, curating and analysing movement data, in order to develop reusable datasets and algorithms for a variety of purposes, remains a challenge. In this work, based on relevant literature on movement representation and existing systems such as Laban Movement Analysis, as well as working with dance experts through workshops, focus groups, and interviews, we propose a conceptual framework for creating, and analysing dance learning content. The conceptual framework, has been developed within an interdisciplinary project, that brings together technology and human computer interaction researchers, computer science engineers, motion capture experts from industry and academia, as well as dance experts with background on four different dance genres: contemporary, ballet, Greek folk, and flamenco. The framework has been applied: a) as a guidance to systematically create a movement library with multimodal recordings for dance education, including four different dance genres, b) as the basis for developing controlled vocabularies of dance for manual and automated annotation, and c) as the conceptual framework to define the requirements for similarity search and feature extraction.",

This book makes it possible to record accurately, for study and reconstruction, the great dance creations of the theater, as well as such diverse activities as time/motion studies for industry, personnel assessment and physical therapy.

            "title": "A perspective on thinking.",
            "abstract": "Research on general thinking abilities-productive, higher order, critical and creative thinking-has progressed slowly compared with the rapid progress that has been made in the study of cognitive structures and procedures. As alternatives to currently prevailing assumptions, three framing assumptions for the study o f thinking are proposed, involving situated cognition, personal and social epistemologies, and conceptual competence. Evidence consistent with these assumptions is outlined, and topics in the psychology of thinking are discussed in relation to the assumptions. The psychological study of thinking has two parts. One part is concerned with performance on specific tasks. The other part is concerned with broader capabilities of productive thinking, higher order thinking skills, critical thinking, and creativity. In the past 20 years, there has been major scientific progress in the psychology of thinking concerned with performance on specific tasks, and much less in the psychology of critical, productive, higher order, and creative thinking. The study of complex information processing, pioneered by Newell and Simon (1972), has provided a progressive framework for analyzing the cognitive structures and processes in many tasks, including tasks used in Piagetian research (Siegler, 1976), puzzles such as cryptarithmetic and the Towers of Hanoi (Anzai & Simon, 1979), items used in intelligence tests (Pellcgrino & Glaser, 1982; Simon & Kotovsky, 1963; Sternberg, 1977), various kinds of syllogisms (Johnson-Laird, 1983), concept identification (Gregg & Simon, 1967), and tasks used in school instruction, especially in science and mathematics (Anderson, 1982; Greeno, 1978; Resnick, in this issue; Riley & Greeno, 1988). Research on the topics of productive, higher order, critical, and creative thinking has not been an integral part of the major success of cognitive and developmental psychology during the past 20 years or so. In contrast to the remarkable progress achieved in analyses of specific tasks, research on general thinking capabilities has not led to significant advances in theoretical understanding or a systematic body of empirical knowledge. Many efforts to enhance children's thinking abilities have been made, and some of these have been evaluated in research studies. Excellent reviews are available by Chipman, Segal, and Glaser (1985); Nickerson, Perkins, and Smith (1985); Resnick (1987); and Segal, Chipman, and Glaser (1985). The dominant psychological idea in these development efforts is that thinking can be viewed as a skill. Successful thinking in specific subj~-'t-matter domains uses knowledge that is specific to the domains, as much research has shown. At the same time, it is reasonable to expect that there are aspects of thinking skill that are common across domains, and this possibility has motivated the development of many programs in the attempt to enhance general thinking skills. Evaluations of several of these programs have shown positive results, which encourage the idea that there are teachable components of general thinking ability. At the same time, there has been no perceptible progress toward a coherent account of what makes some of the programs succeed; nor has the research contributed significantly toward a set of principles that would constitute an articulate theory of the characteristics of thinking abilities. Nickerson, Perkins, and Smith (1985) summed up the situation, at least regarding programs emphasizing cognitive operations, as follows: Reviewing the various programs discussed, we are impressed by how easy it is to make up a list of fundamental operations, and also by the fact that the lists produced by different programs differ considerably from one another. Each of these lists can be seen as a theory of the components of intelligence or at least of determinants of intellectual performance. And this is the problem. There are too many of these theories for comfort. To be sure, some themes recur frequently but the differences are substantial. (p. 188) Some of the causes of this relatively slow progress may be implicit in the theories and framing assumptions that have dominated our scientific inquiry. There are three framing assumptions about thinking and learning that may be responsible for our apparent inability to develop a more adequate theory of thinking. First, the locus of thinking is assumed to be in an individual's mind, rather than in interaction between an agent and a physical and social situation. Second, processes of thinking and learning are assumed to be uniform across persons and situations. Different individuals are more or less capable of critical or creative thinking, and different situations are more or less conducive to learning and thinking, but the activities of thinking and learning are assumed to have approximately the same character wherever and in whomever they occur. Third, resources for thinking are assumed to be knowledge and skills that are built up from simple components, especially through instruction in school, rather than general conceptual capabilities that children may have as a result of their everyday experience or native endowment. 134 February 1989 • American Psychologist Copyright 1989 by the American Psychological Association, Inc. 0003-066X/89/$00.75 Vol. 44, No, 2, 134-141 These framing assumptions are reflected in the research and discussions of thinking, including discussions of creative thinking, where Kogan (1983) has summarized a large body of research about whether individuals think divergently or convergenfly and where Weisberg (1986) recently debunked several accounts in terms of genius, divergent thinking, mysterious insight, and inspiration and proposed replacing these with an account in terms of information-processing, problem-solving capabilities; motivation; and concentration. Resnick's (1987) discussion characterized higher order thinking as nonalgorithmic, complex, self-regulative, meaningful, effortful, and providing multiple solutions, nuanced judgments, multiple criteria, and uncertainty, all defined in terms of cognitive traits and processes of individuals. Chipman (1986) characterized a consensus among cognitive scientists that successful thinking depends on organization of cognitive activity with a hierarchy of goals and operations. Alternative Framing Assumptions A different set of framing assumptions may be needed if we are to make significant headway toward an adequate understanding of thinking and creativity. The three assumptions that I propose are the following. 1. Situated cognition. Thinking is situated in physical and social contexts. Cognition, including thinking, knowing, and learning, can be considered as a relation involving an agent in a situation, rather than as an activity in an individual's mind. 2. Personal and social epistemologies. Thinking and learning are situated in contexts of beliefs and understandings about cognition that differ between individuals and social groups, and fundamental properties of thinking and learning are determined by these contexts. 3. Conceptual competence. Children have strong potential capabilities for cognitive growth that enable complex and subtle processes of construction of knowledge and thinking skills. Thinking~ learning, and cognitive growth are activities in which children elaborate and reorganize their knowledge and understanding, rather than simply applying and acquiring cognitive structures and procedures. These assumptions are too general to allow direct empirical tests. Their acceptance will depend on the theoretical analyses and systematic empirical work that result from their use. At the same time, there are at least three kinds of empirical evidence that are consistent with the assumptions and encourage their further use and development.

Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to James G. Greeno, School of Education, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305. Situated Cognition We have thought of thinking as a process within an individual's mind, perhaps influenced by a context provided by the situation. Recent ethnographic research suggests a different view, in which thinking is an interaction between an individual and a physical and social situation. One example is in observations by Seribner (1984) of young men whose job is to fill drivers' orders in a dairy. The task involves different products that come in different-sized containers. Containers are packed in cases; the number of containers per case is different for the different container sizes. The worker gets a form failed out for each driver, in a special notation that shows, for each product, a number of cases and a number of containers that should be added or subtracted. The task could be done algorithmically; for example, the loader could locate the number of full cases that are specified and either remove the number of containers specified with a negative integer or add a partial case with the number of containers specified with a positive integer. The loaders did better, using partial cases to obtain more efficient solutions. The workers used optimal solutions in more than 90% of the cases that were observed. These workers' performance was not based on mathematical knowledge of the kind that we might expect individuals to obtain in school. We can imagine giving a word problem in arithmetic about the situation, involving the number of cases and containers needed for the order, the number of containers in a partially filled case, and the question \"How many more containers are needed for the order to be filled correctly?\" We would expect some pencil-an",

            "abstract": "One of the surprising recurring phenomena observed in experiments with boosting is that the test error of the generated classifier usually does not increase as its size becomes very large, and often is observed to decrease even after the training error reaches zero. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance",

We also introduced the related notion of a \"pseudo-loss\" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's \"bagging\" method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute- value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem.",

Each bootstrap sample leaves out about 37% of the examples. These left-out examples can be used to form accurate estimates of important quantities. For instance, they can be used to give much improved estimates of node probabilities and node error rates in decision trees. Using estimated outputs instead of the observed outputs improves accuracy in regression trees. They can also be used to give nearly optimal estimates of generalization errors for bagged predictors.",

            "title": "CULTURE IN ACTION: SYMBOLS AND STRATEGIES*",
            "abstract": "Culture influences action not by providing the ultimate values toward which action is oriented, but by shaping a repertoire or \"tool kit\" of habits, skills, and styles from which people construct \"strategies of action.\" Two models of cultural influence are developed, for settled and unsettled cultural periods. In settled periods, culture independently influences action, but only by providing resources from which people can construct diverse lines of action. In unsettled cultural periods, explicit ideologies directly govern action, but structural opportunities for action determine which among competing ideologies survive in the long run. This alternative view of culture offers new opportunities for systematic, differentiated arguments about culture's causal role in shaping action. The reigning model used to understand culture's effects on action is fundamentally misleading. It assumes that culture shapes action by supplying ultimate ends or values toward which action is directed, thus making values the central causal element of culture. This paper analyzes the conceptual difficulties into which this traditional view of culture leads and offers an alternative model. Among sociologists and anthropologists, debate has raged for several academic generations over defining the term \"culture.\" Since the seminal work of Clifford Geertz (1973a), the older definition of culture as the entire way of life of a people, including their technology and material artifacts, or that (associated with the name of Ward Goodenough) as everything one would need to know to become a functioning member of a society, have been displaced in favor of defining culture as the publicly available symbolic forms through which people experience and express meaning (see Keesing, 1974). For purposes of this paper, culture consists of such symbolic vehicles of meaning, including beliefs, ritual practices, art forms, and ceremonies, as well as informal cultural practices such as language, gossip, stories, and rituals of daily life. These symbolic forms are the means through which \"social processes of sharing modes of behavior and outlook within [a] community\" (Hannerz, 1969:184) take place.",

Extension of Goffinan's (1974) frame analytic perspective provides the conceptualltheoretical framework; field research on two religious movements, the peace movement, and several neighborhood movements provide the primary empirical base. Four frame alignment processes are identified and elaborated: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension, and frame transformation. The basic underlying premise is that frame alignment, of one variety or another, is a necessary condition for participation, whatever its nature or intensity, and that it is typically an interactional and ongoing accomplishment. The paper concludes with an elaboration of several sets of theoretical and research implications.",

            "” Important work in social psychology has focused upon the development of such critical self-awareness, often building upon Meadian conceptions of communicative interaction (Cottrell 1969; Denzin 1988; Callero 1991; Schwalbe 1991). Of particular relevance here is previously mentioned work on life course development, with its focus upon trajectories and turning points (Elder 1985; George 1993), especially work examining the subjective and/or narrative reconstruction of the self through self-interpretive activity during critical life transitions (Cohler 1982). The temporal dimension of such selfconstruction was stressed three decades ago by Erik Erikson, who showed how conceptions of time develop and change at key transitional periods in the life cycle; for example, a critical task of adolescence is the construction of a sense of a future connected with a past, as manifested in a personal identity that “includes a subjective sense of continuous existence” (Erikson 1968, p. 61). Likewise, researchers on adulthood and aging have noted self-reflective shifts in temporal perspectives as individuals become less preoccupied with the future and more engaged in ruminations upon the past: “While reminiscence is used by much older persons primarily as a means of settling accounts prior to death . . . middle-aged persons are more likely to use reminiscence in an effort to solve problems in the present” (Cohler 1982, p. 225). With so much attention to temporal perspectives within the subfield of social psychology, it is remarkable that so little of it has made its way into mainstream theoretical and empirical traditions in sociology. More work is necessary in order to link the study of temporal constructions with the varieties of agentic activity that we have tried to delineate in this article. We can formulate this as a final exploratory proposition: By subjecting their own agentic orientations to imaginative recomposition and critical judgment, actors can loosen themselves from past patterns of interaction and reframe their relationships to existing constraints. A classic example is Freudian psychoanalysis, in which interpretive recollection of past experiences has a liberating effect upon action; Ricoeur (1970) points out that this process is projective as well, suggesting research into how temporal orientations are intermingled (and undergo changes) in the course of therapeutic processes.",

        "abstract": "Movement is a basic form of gaining experience and communication through which children learn to cope with different tasks in their lives (Sharir, 2007). Humans are capable of using their bodies to express their ideas and emotions through movement (Ronen, 2011). In particular, children learn to move their bodies, develop their imagination and express their thoughts through dance (Bahat-Ratzon, 2004). This research study focuses on two important areas for proper overall child development: the area of motor skills and the area of emotions. The study examined the effect of folk dancing/circle dancing on emotional self-control and regulation and self-confidence among early childhood-aged children, while comparing circle dancing to dancing in an unorganized open space. In addition, the study examined the effect of circle dancing on the children’s emotional intelligence abilities. Questionnaires were distributed to 60 children from a varied age range in two kibbutz kindergarten classes: in one kindergarten class, the children gained experience in dancing in an organized fashion throughout the year; in the second kindergarten class, the children were not exposed to folk dancing. The Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire examined the emotional intelligence level of the children in both kindergarten classes and their progress in this area throughout the year. The findings showed evidence of an improvement in emotional intelligence among children in both kindergarten classes; there were significant differences between children in the two classes regarding some emotional intelligence variables as a result of circle dancing. In addition, the findings point to a strong correlation between circle dancing and emotional regulation and self-control. On the contrary, no strong correlation was found between emotional regulation and self-control and the variables of gender and age of the children.",

        "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated that motor execution, observation, and imagery of movements expressing certain emotions can enhance corresponding affective states and therefore could be used for emotion regulation. But which specific movement(s) should one use in order to enhance each emotion? This study aimed to identify, using Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), the Laban motor elements (motor characteristics) that characterize movements whose execution enhances each of the basic emotions: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. LMA provides a system of symbols describing its motor elements, which gives a written instruction (motif) for the execution of a movement or movement-sequence over time. Six senior LMA experts analyzed a validated set of video clips showing whole body dynamic expressions of anger, fear, happiness and sadness, and identified the motor elements that were common to (appeared in) all clips expressing the same emotion. For each emotion, we created motifs of different combinations of the motor elements common to all clips of the same emotion. Eighty subjects from around the world read and moved those motifs, to identify the emotion evoked when moving each motif and to rate the intensity of the evoked emotion. All subjects together moved and rated 1241 motifs, which were produced from 29 different motor elements. Using logistic regression, we found a set of motor elements associated with each emotion which, when moved, predicted the feeling of that emotion. Each emotion was predicted by a unique set of motor elements and each motor element predicted only one emotion. Knowledge of which specific motor elements enhance specific emotions can enable emotional self-regulation through adding some desired motor qualities to one's personal everyday movements (rather than mimicking others' specific movements) and through decreasing motor behaviors which include elements that enhance negative emotions.",

            "abstract": "In the pain-flexor reflex, arm extension is temporally coupled with the onset of the unconditioned aversive stimulus, whereas flexion is associated with its offset; when retrieving desirable stimuli, arm flexion is more closely coupled temporally to the acquisition or consumption of the desired stimuli than arm extension. It was posited that these contingencies foster an association between arm flexion, in contrast to extension, and approach motivational orientations. Six experiments were conducted to examine this hypothesis. Ideographs presented during arm flexion were subsequently ranked more positively than ideographs presented during arm extension, but only when the Ss' task was to evaluate the ideographs when they were presented initially. Arm flexion and extension were also each found to have discernible attitudinal effects. These results suggest a possible role for nondeclarative memory in attitude formation.",

To foster embodied interaction, we need interfaces that can develop a complex, meaningful understanding of intention—both kinesthetic and emotional—as it emerges through natural human movement. The movements are emulated on robots or other devices with sensory-motor features as a part of games that aim improving the social interaction skills of children. The design of an example game platform that is used for training of children with autism is described since the type of the emotional behaviors depends on the embodiment of the robot and the context of the game. The results show that quantitative movement parameters can be matched to emotional state of the embodied agent (human or robot) using the Laban movement analysis. Emotional movements that were emulated on robots using this principle were tested with children in the age group 7–9. The tests show reliable recognition on most of the behaviors.",

Contrary to the early assumption that body movement only indicates emotional intensity, recent studies have shown that body movement and posture also conveys emotion specific information. However, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is hampered by a lack of production studies informed by a theoretical framework. In this research we adopted the Body Action and Posture (BAP) coding system to examine the types and patterns of body movement that are employed by 10 professional actors to portray a set of 12 emotions. We investigated to what extent these expression patterns support explicit or implicit predictions from basic emotion theory, bidimensional theory, and componential appraisal theory. The overall results showed partial support for the different theoretical approaches. They revealed that several patterns of body movement systematically occur in portrayals of specific emotions, allowing emotion differentiation. Although a few emotions were prototypically expressed by one particular pattern, most emotions were variably expressed by multiple patterns, many of which can be explained as reflecting functional components of emotion such as modes of appraisal and action readiness. It is concluded that further work in this largely underdeveloped area should be guided by an appropriate theoretical framework to allow a more systematic design of experiments and clear hypothesis testing.",

The logic of the procedure was adopted from studies by F. Strack, L. Martin, and S. Stepper (1988), who unobtrusively manipulated people's facial expressions. In the 1st experiment, a functionally equivalent technique was used to vary the posture of the body. Study 1 results revealed that success at an achievement task led to greater feelings of pride if the outcome was received in an upright position rather than in a slumped posture. Study 2 results revealed that nonemotional feelings of effort were influenced by contraction of the forehead muscle (corrugator), and Ss' self-ratings on a trait dimension reflected this experience when the facial contraction was maintained during the recall of behavioral episodes exemplifying this trait. To account for these results, a framework is proposed that draws on a distinction between noetic and experiential representations.",

When the message arguments were strong, nodding produced more persuasion than shaking. When the arguments were weak, the reverse occurred. These effects were most pronounced when elaboration was high. These findings are consistent with the \"self-validation\" hypothesis that postulates that head movements either enhance (nodding) or undermine (shaking) confidence in one's thoughts about the message. In a 4th experiment, the authors extended this result to another overt behavior (writing with the dominant or nondominant hand) and a different attitude domain (self-esteem).",

            "abstract": "Human movement is essentially the process of moving one or more body parts to a specific location along a certain trajectory. A person observing the movement might be able to recognize it through the spatial pathway alone. Kendon (Kendon, 2004) holds the view that willingly or not, humans, when in co-presence, continuously inform one another about their intentions, interests, feelings and ideas by means of visible bodily action. Analysis of face-toface interaction has shown that bodily action can play a crucial role in the process of interaction and communication. Kendon states that expressive actions like greeting, threat and submission often play a central role in social interaction. In order to access the expressive content of movements theoretically, a notational system is needed. Rudolf Laban, (1879-1958) was a notable central European dance artist and theorist, whose work laid the foundations for Laban Movement Analysis (LMA). Used as a tool by dancers, athletes, physical and occupational therapists, it is one of the most widely used systems of human movement analysis. Robotics has already acknowledged the evidence that human movements could be an important cue for Human-Robot Interaction. Sato et al. (Sato et al., 1996), while defining the requirements for 'human symbiosis robotics' state that those robots should be able to use non-verbal media to communicate with humans and exchange information. As input modalities on a higher abstraction level they define channels on language, gesture and unconscious behavior. This skill could enable the robot to actively perceive human behavior, whether conscious and unconscious. Human intention could be understood, simply by observation, allowing the system to achieve a certain level of friendliness, hospitality and reliance. Fong, Nourbakhsh and Dautenhahn (Fong et al., 2003) state in their survey on 'socially interactive robots' that the design of sociable robots needs input from research concerning social learning and imitation, gesture and natural language communication, emotion and recognition of interaction patterns. Otero et al. suggest (Otero et al., 2006) that the interpretation of a person’s motion within its environment can enhance Human-Robot Interaction in several ways. They point out, that a recognized action can help the robot to plan its future tasks and goals, that the information flow during interaction can be extended and additional cues, like speech recognition, can be supported. Otero et al. state that body motion and context provide in many situations enough information to derive the person’s current activity.",

            "abstract": "Research into the expression and perception of emotions has mostly focused on facial expressions. Recently, body postures have become increasingly important in research, but knowledge on muscle activity during the perception or expression of emotion is lacking. The current study continues the development of a Body Action Coding System (BACS), which was initiated in a previous study, and described the involvement of muscles in the neck, shoulders and arms during expression of fear and anger. The current study expands the BACS by assessing the activity patterns of three additional muscles. Surface electromyography of muscles in the neck (upper trapezius descendens), forearms (extensor carpi ulnaris), lower back (erector spinae longissimus) and calves (peroneus longus) were measured during active expression and passive viewing of fearful and angry body expressions. The muscles in the forearm were strongly active for anger expression and to a lesser extent for fear expression. In contrast, muscles in the calves were recruited slightly more for fearful expressions. It was also found that muscles automatically responded to the perception of emotion, without any overt movement. The observer's forearms responded to the perception of fear, while the muscles used for leaning backwards were activated when faced with an angry adversary. Lastly, the calf responded immediately when a fearful person was seen, but responded slower to anger. There is increasing interest in developing systems that are able to create or recognize emotional body language for the development of avatars, robots, and online environments. To that end, multiple coding systems have been developed that can either interpret or create bodily expressions based on static postures, motion capture data or videos. However, the BACS is the first coding system based on muscle activity.",

        "abstract": "Many analysis tasks for human motion rely on high-level similarity between sequences of motions, that are not an exact matches in joint angles, timing, or ordering of actions. Even the same movements performed by the same person can vary in duration and speed. Similar motions are characterized by similar sets of actions that appear frequently. In this paper we introduce motion motifs and motion signatures that are a succinct but descriptive representation of motion sequences. We first break the motion sequences to short-term movements called motion words, and then cluster the words in a high-dimensional feature space to find motifs. Hence, motifs are words that are both common and descriptive, and their distribution represents the motion sequence. To cluster words and find motifs, the challenge is to define an effective feature space, where the distances among motion words are semantically meaningful, and where variations in speed and duration are handled. To this end, we use a deep neural network to embed the motion words into feature space using a triplet loss function. To define a signature, we choose a finite set of motion-motifs, creating a bag-of-motifs representation for the sequence. Motion signatures are agnostic to movement order, speed or duration variations, and can distinguish fine-grained differences between motions of the same class. We illustrate examples of characterizing motion sequences by motifs, and for the use of motion signatures in a number of applications.",

Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.",

The difficulty of scaling search to large datasets largely explains why most academic work on time series data mining has plateaued at considering a few millions of time series objects, while much of industry and science sits on billions of time series objects waiting to be explored. In this work we show that by using a combination of four novel ideas we can search and mine truly massive time series for the first time. We demonstrate the following extremely unintuitive fact; in large datasets we can exactly search under DTW much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art Euclidean distance search algorithms. We demonstrate our work on the largest set of time series experiments ever attempted. In particular, the largest dataset we consider is larger than the combined size of all of the time series datasets considered in all data mining papers ever published. We show that our ideas allow us to solve higher-level time series data mining problem such as motif discovery and clustering at scales that would otherwise be untenable. In addition to mining massive datasets, we will show that our ideas also have implications for real-time monitoring of data streams, allowing us to handle much faster arrival rates and/or use cheaper and lower powered devices than are currently possible.",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of 3D human pose estimation from a single color image. Despite the general success of the end-to-end learning paradigm, top performing approaches employ a two-step solution consisting of a Convolutional Network (ConvNet) for 2D joint localization and a subsequent optimization step to recover 3D pose. In this paper, we identify the representation of 3D pose as a critical issue with current ConvNet approaches and make two important contributions towards validating the value of end-to-end learning for this task. First, we propose a fine discretization of the 3D space around the subject and train a ConvNet to predict per voxel likelihoods for each joint. This creates a natural representation for 3D pose and greatly improves performance over the direct regression of joint coordinates. Second, to further improve upon initial estimates, we employ a coarse-to-fine prediction scheme. This step addresses the large dimensionality increase and enables iterative refinement and repeated processing of the image features. The proposed approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks achieving a relative error reduction greater than 30% on average. Additionally, we investigate using our volumetric representation in a related architecture which is suboptimal compared to our end-to-end approach, but is of practical interest, since it enables training when no image with corresponding 3D groundtruth is available, and allows us to present compelling results for in-the-wild images.",

The desired patches need to satisfy two requirements: 1) to be representative, they need to occur frequently enough in the visual world; 2) to be discriminative, they need to be different enough from the rest of the visual world. The patches could correspond to parts, objects, \"visual phrases\", etc. but are not restricted to be any one of them. We pose this as an unsupervised discriminative clustering problem on a huge dataset of image patches. We use an iterative procedure which alternates between clustering and training discriminative classifiers, while applying careful cross-validation at each step to prevent overfitting. The paper experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of discriminative patches as an unsupervised mid-level visual representation, suggesting that it could be used in place of visual words for many tasks. Furthermore, discriminative patches can also be used in a supervised regime, such as scene classification, where they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Indoor-67 dataset.",

Using the example of human motion capture data challenges exist in creating compact solutions that still re-ﬂect semantics and kinematics in a meaningful way. We present a visual-interactive approach for the semi-supervised labeling of human motion capture data. Users are enabled to assign labels to the data which can subsequently be used to represent the multivariate time series as sequences of motion classes. The approach combines multiple views supporting the user in the visual-interactive labeling process. Visual guidance concepts further ease the labeling process by propagating the results of supportive algorithmic models. The abstraction of motion capture data to sequences of event intervals allows overview and detail-on-demand visualizations even for large and heterogeneous data collections. The guided selection of candidate data for the extension and improvement of the labeling closes the feedback loop of the semi-supervised workﬂow. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the efﬁciency of the approach in two usage scenarios, taking visual-interactive learning and human motion synthesis as examples.",

Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings asfeature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-artface recognition performance using only 128-bytes perface. On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63%. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result [15] by 30% on both datasets.",

        "abstract": "With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence technology to make smart devices, understanding how humans develop trust in virtual agents is emerging as a critical research field. Through our research, we report on a novel methodology to investigate user’s trust in auditory assistance in a Virtual Reality (VR) based search task, under both high and low cognitive load and under varying levels of agent accuracy. We collected physiological sensor data such as electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and heart-rate variability (HRV), subjective data through questionnaire such as System Trust Scale (STS), Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ) and NASA-TLX. We also collected a behavioral measure of trust (congruency of users’ head motion in response to valid/ invalid verbal advice from the agent). Our results indicate that our custom VR environment enables researchers to measure and understand human trust in virtual agents using the matrices, and both cognitive load and agent accuracy play an important role in trust formation. We discuss the implications of the research and directions for future work.",

We present two studies using virtual reality to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Study 1, 50 participants interacted with two avatars who either mimicked their head and torso movements at a 1 or 3 second time delay or did not mimic, and rated feelings of rapport and trust toward the avatars. Rapport was higher towards mimicking avatars, with no effect of timing. In Study 2, we aimed to replicate this effect in a pre-registered design and test whether it is modulated by cultural ingroup-outgroup boundaries. Forty participants from European or East Asian backgrounds interacted with four avatars, two of European appearance and two of East Asian appearance. Two avatars mimicked while the other two did not. We found no effects of mimicry on rapport or trust ratings or implicit trust behaviour in a novel maze task, and no effects of group status or interactions. These null results were calculated in line with our pre-registration. We conclude that being mimicked does not always increase rapport or trust, and make suggestions for future directions.",

Its neural basis, however, has remained a mystery. Here, we propose that cognitive control stems from the active maintenance of patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex that represent goals and the means to achieve them. They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task. We review neurophysiological, neurobiological, neuroimaging, and computational studies that support this theory and discuss its implications as well as further issues to be addressed",

We built a participant-independent cognitive stress recognition model based on photoplethysmographic signals measured remotely at a distance of 3 meters. We tested the model on naturalistic responses from 10 individuals completing randomized-order computer-based tasks (ball control and card sorting). The system successfully detected increased stress during the tasks, which were consistent with self-report measures.

We studied 19 healthy young subjects performing a balance beam walking task in two virtual reality conditions and with unaltered view (15 minutes each) to determine if virtual reality high heights exposure induced stress. We recorded number of steps off the beam, heart rate, electrodermal activity, response time to an auditory cue, and high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We hypothesized that virtual high heights exposure would increase measures of physiological stress compared to unaltered viewing at low heights. We found that the virtual high height condition increased heart rate variability and heart rate frequency power relative to virtual low heights. Virtual reality use resulted in increased number of step-offs, heart rate, electrodermal activity, and response time compared to the unaltered viewing at low heights condition. Our results indicated that virtual reality decreased dynamic balance performance and increased physical and cognitive loading compared to unaltered viewing at low heights. In virtual reality, we found significant decreases in source-localized EEG peak amplitude relative to unaltered viewing in the anterior cingulate, which is considered important in sensing loss of balance. Our findings indicate that virtual reality provides realistic experiences that can induce physiological stress in humans during dynamic balance tasks, but virtual reality use impairs physical and cognitive performance during balance.",

However, most of those applications are not adaptive to the real-time cognitive or subjectively experienced load placed on the trainee. In this paper, we explore a cognitively adaptive training system based on real-time measurement of task related alpha activity in the brain. This measurement was made by a 32-channel mobile Electroencephalography (EEG) system, and was used to adapt the task difficulty to an ideal level which challenged our participants, and thus theoretically induces the best level of performance gains as a result of training. Our system required participants to select target objects in VR and the complexity of the task adapted to the alpha activity in the brain. A total of 14 participants undertook our training and completed 20 levels of increasing complexity. Our study identified significant differences in brain activity in response to increasing levels of task complexity, but response time did not alter as a function of task difficulty. Collectively, we interpret this to indicate the brain's ability to compensate for higher task load without affecting behaviourally measured visuomotor performance.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sexual harassment is a type of trauma that causes various physiological and mental phenomena, including a regression in the perception of body image and its preoccupation with it. Studies indicate that there is a link between psychological functioning and physical function, where engagement with the body affects psychological functioning. Research has pointed to the relationship between body image and dance in the therapeutic context. It has been shown that there is a positive and close relationship between dancing and movement and the way women perceive their bodies. The main purpose of this study was to examine how the frequent practice of belly dance, also called Oriental dance, affects perception of body image and self-esteem among women who have experienced sexual harassment in the past. In this study, 152 subjects were examined, 78 women who partake in belly dance and 74 women who do not. Research hypotheses were confirmed, and a significant positive correlation was found between self-esteem, body image, and belly dancing among women who previously experienced sexual harassment.",

Sociocultural messages influence the concepts of body image, personal appearance, and weight, encouraging men to develop lean and muscular bodies. The current study examined adolescent boys’ body image and its relationship to their subjective well-being (SWB) and the effect of the parent–adolescent relationship on body image and SWB. Participating in the research were 107 adolescent boys in Israel, aged 13 to 18 years. Four questionnaires were utilized: demographic, body mass index, Body Investment Scale, and Personal Well-Being Index. The findings indicate a significant, medium positive correlation between SWB and body image.

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe authors assessed lifetime psychopathology in a general population sample and compared the rates of five psychiatric disorder categories between those who reported a childhood history of either physical or sexual abuse and those who did not.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and a self-completed questionnaire on child abuse were administered to a probability sample (N=7,016) of Ontario residents 15 to 64 years of age.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThose reporting a history of childhood physical abuse had significantly higher lifetime rates of anxiety disorders, alcohol abuse/dependence, and antisocial behavior and were more likely to have one or more disorders than were those without such a history. Women, but not men, with a history of physical abuse had significantly higher lifetime rates of major depression and illicit drug abuse/dependence than did women with no such history. A history of childhood sexual abuse was also associated with higher rates of all disorders considered in women. In men, the prevalence of disorders tended to be higher among those who reported exposure to sexual abuse, but only the associations with alcohol abuse/dependence and the category of one or more disorders reached statistical significance. The relationship between a childhood history of physical abuse and lifetime psychopathology varied significantly by gender for all categories except for anxiety disorders. Although not statistically significant, a similar relationship was seen between childhood history of sexual abuse and lifetime psychopathology.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA history of abuse in childhood increases the likelihood of lifetime psychopathology; this association appears stronger for women than men.",

Although technically the captured data can be of very high quality, folk dancing, in contrast to choreographed performances, allow for stylistic variations and improvisations that cannot be easily captured by the data themselves. The majority of motion analysis and comparison algorithms are explicitly based on quantitative metrics and thus do not usually provide any insight on style qualities of a performance. In this work, we introduce a motion analysis and comparison framework that is based on Laban Movement Analysis (LMA); these algorithms are particularly useful in the context of teaching folk dances. We present a prototype virtual reality simulator in which users can preview segments of folk dance performed by a 3D avatar and repeat them. The users' performances are captured and subsequently compared to the folk dance template motions. The system then provides intuitive feedback about their performance, which is based on the four LMA components (Body, Effort, Shape, Space) and provides both a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the performance.",

            "abstract": "Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed—either explicitly or implicitly—to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or speed. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis. The specific benefits of randomized techniques depend on the computational environment. Consider the model problem of finding the $k$ dominant components of the singular value decomposition of an $m \\times n$ matrix. (i) For a dense input matrix, randomized algorithms require $\\bigO(mn \\log(k))$ floating-point operations (flops) in contrast to $ \\bigO(mnk)$ for classical algorithms. (ii) For a sparse input matrix, the flop count matches classical Krylov subspace methods, but the randomized approach is more robust and can easily be reorganized to exploit multiprocessor architectures. (iii) For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, the randomized techniques require only a constant number of passes over the data, as opposed to $\\bigO(k)$ passes for classical algorithms. In fact, it is sometimes possible to perform matrix approximation with a single pass over the data.",

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls \"embodied interaction\" -- an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality -- reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.",

A collaborative method of video interaction analysis devised to suit design explorations, the Video Card Game, was used to capture and analyse how gesture is used in the context of six different domains: the dentist's office; PDA and mobile phone use; the experimental biologist's laboratory; a city ferry service; a video cassette player repair shop; and a factory flowmeter assembly station. Findings are presented in the form of gestural themes, derived from the tradition of qualitative analysis but bearing some similarity to Alexandrian patterns. Implications for the design of gestural devices are discussed.",

Our analysis identified a range of advantages and disadvantages of the potential use of Labanotation in design. Its major disadvantage is the effort required to learn how to use it. But it supports a representation of movement that can be easily linked into the context and point of interaction. This provides a valuable foundation for design of movement-based interaction.",

Examples include \"How important is leisure time to you?\" \"How satisfied are you with yourself?\"; or \"How satisfied are you with your work?\" Yet despite easy availability, this is one data source that economists rarely use. In fact, the unwillingness to rely on such questions marks an important divide between economists and other social scientists. This neglect does not come from disinterest. Most economists would probably agree that the variables these questions attempt to uncover are interesting and important. But they doubt whether these questions elicit meaningful answers. These doubts are, however, based on a priori skepticism rather than on evidence. This ignores a large body of experimental and empirical work that has investigated the meaningfulness of answers to these questions. Our primary objective in this paper is to summarize this literature for an audience of economists. Thereby turning a vague implicit distrust into an explicit position grounded in facts. Having summarized the findings, we integrate them into a measurement error framework so as to understand what they imply for empirical research relying on subjective data. Finally, in order to calibrate the extent of the measurement error problem, we perform some simple empirical work using specific subjective questions.",

The format and nature of the individual entries can be exempliμed by the treatment given to the initial entry, although many fables receive considerably briefer treatment. First, the tale is thoroughly identiμed: the heading (H. 1) indicates that the narrative is the initial fable in Hausrath’s edition; additional references and cross-references relate the fable to A.’s medieval inventory (M. 33), to other critical editions of anonymous Greek fables (Chambry 3, Perry 1), and to pertinent motifs in Stith Thompson’s Motif-Index of Folk-Literature; and the title of the fable is given in Greek (Aetos kai Alôpêks) and in English. After this basic information, the Greek and Latin sources for the tale of the Eagle and the Fox are given, leading to a summary of the fable’s contents and observations on variations in content by di¶erent authors. Next, A. o¶ers a brief description of the structure, characters, and themes of the fable, along with observations on its history and development, culminating in a stemma that traces the fable’s literary history, as the author reconstructs it, from Archilochos to Romulus. Finally, A. prints possible traces of Hellenistic verse in the Greek prose versions, in support of his conviction that this fable is one of many that derive from a lost book of fables in Greek verse. Frequent references are made throughout to earlier discussions of di¶erent aspects of the Eagle and the Fox in Volumes I and II. The entry on this fable concludes with two separate sets of supplementary references, new to the English edition, one by A. and the other by van Dijk. The fable inventory is the fruit of an enormous amount of meticulous scholarship, and it will be a welcome resource for all scholars pursuing work on individual Greek and Latin fables and fable-like narratives. Nevertheless, some of the evidence and results will be of little interest to researchers who do not share A.’s conclusions concerning the transmission of the ancient Greek fables, which, for one thing, is seen as an almost entirely literary process. The reader will μnd a summary of the author’s views at the end of the preceding volume (II.711–26). The four-part fable inventory is followed by an impressive series of indices, over 100 pages of them, prepared by van Dijk. These include correlations of the enumeration of the fables in the present work to those in the standard critical editions as well as to Antti Aarne’s and Stith Thompson’s The Types of the Folktale and to Thompson’s Motif-Index of Folk-Literature, an index of the languages of the fables cited, an index of the fables by character, and an index of fable passages cited.

        "abstract": "Emotion communication research strongly focuses on the face and voice as expressive modalities, leaving the rest of the body relatively understudied. Contrary to the early assumption that body movement only indicates emotional intensity, recent studies have shown that body movement and posture also conveys emotion specific information. However, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is hampered by a lack of production studies informed by a theoretical framework. In this research we adopted the Body Action and Posture (BAP) coding system to examine the types and patterns of body movement that are employed by 10 professional actors to portray a set of 12 emotions. We investigated to what extent these expression patterns support explicit or implicit predictions from basic emotion theory, bidimensional theory, and componential appraisal theory. The overall results showed partial support for the different theoretical approaches. They revealed that several patterns of body movement systematically occur in portrayals of specific emotions, allowing emotion differentiation. Although a few emotions were prototypically expressed by one particular pattern, most emotions were variably expressed by multiple patterns, many of which can be explained as reflecting functional components of emotion such as modes of appraisal and action readiness. It is concluded that further work in this largely underdeveloped area should be guided by an appropriate theoretical framework to allow a more systematic design of experiments and clear hypothesis testing.",

Core affect can therefore be experienced as free-floating (mood) or can be attributed to some cause (and thereby begin an emotional episode). These basic processes spawn a broad framework that includes perception of the core-affect-altering properties of stimuli, motives, empathy, emotional meta-experience, and affect versus emotion regulation; it accounts for prototypical emotional episodes, such as fear and anger, as core affect attributed to something plus various nonemotional processes.",

Their perceptual judgments are based on simple movement features, such as overall speed, but also on more intricate posture and dynamic cues. The systematic analysis of such features is complicated due to the difficulty of considering the large number of potentially relevant kinematic and dynamic parameters. To identify emotion-specific features we motion-captured the neutral and emotionally expressive (anger, happiness, sadness, fear) gaits of 25 individuals. Body posture was characterized by average flexion angles, and a low-dimensional parameterization of the spatio-temporal structure of joint trajectories was obtained by approximation with a nonlinear mixture model. Applying sparse regression, we extracted critical emotion-specific posture and movement features, which typically depended only on a small number of joints. The features we extracted from the motor behavior closely resembled features that were critical for the perception of emotion from gait, determined by a statistical analysis of classification and rating judgments of 21 observers presented with avatars animated with the recorded movements. The perceptual relevance of these features was further supported by another experiment showing that artificial walkers containing only the critical features induced high-level after-effects matching those induced by adaptation with natural emotional walkers.",

A total of 224 portrayals were subjected to digital acoustic analysis to obtain profiles of vocal parameters for different emotions. The data suggest that vocal parameters not only index the degree of intensity typical for different emotions but also differentiate valence or quality aspects. The data are also used to test theoretical predictions on vocal patterning based on the component process model of emotion (K.R. Scherer, 1986). Although most hypotheses are supported, some need to be revised on the basis of the empirical evidence.

The latter is explained by (a) a paucity of research on voice quality, (b) neglect of the social signaling functions of affect vocalization, and (c) insufficiently precise conceptualization of the underlying emotional states. A \"component patterning\" model of vocal affect expression is proposed that attempts to rink the outcomes of antecedent event evaluation to biologically based response patterns. On the basis of a literature survey of acoustic-phonetic evidence, the likely phonatory and articulatory correlates of the physiological responses characterizing different emotional states are described in the form of three major voice types (narrow-wide, lax-tense, full-thin). Specific predictions are made as to the changes in acoustic parameters resulting from changing voice types. These predictions are compared with the pattern of empirical findings yielded by a comprehensive survey of the literature on vocal cues in emotional expression. Although the comparison is largely limited to the tense-lax voice type (because acoustic parameters relevant to the other voice types have not yet been systematically studied), a high degree of convergence is revealed. It is suggested that the model may help to stimulate hypothesis-guided research as well as provide a framework for the development of appropriate research paradigms.",

This is done on the basis of clinical behavior samples that compared movements of psychiatric patients before and after therapy (N = 20). Results indicate that subjective judgments of movement quality are used reliably by lay judges and that these judgments are related closely to objective movement parameters. Some characteristics of movement quality seem to be important cues in clinical judgments of patients' improvement, although, objectively, movements do not differ before and after successful therapy.",

The reasons for these findings are reviewed, and integrating this review with two recent theories of emotions (Roseman, 1984; Scherer, 1982), we propose eight cognitive appraisal dimensions to differentiate emotional experience. In an investigation of this model, subjects recalled past experiences associated with each of 15 emotions, and rated them along the proposed dimensions. Six orthogonal dimensions, pleasantness, anticipated effort, certainty, attentional activity, self-other responsibility/control, and situational control, were recovered, and the emotions varied systematically along each of these dimensions, indicating a strong relation between the appraisal of one's circumstances and one's emotional state. The patterns of appraisal for the different emotions, and the role of each of the dimensions in differentiating emotional experience are discussed.",

If you read this book, you'll never look at other people in quite the same way again.\" Malcolm GladwellRenowned psychologist Paul Ekman explains the roots of our emotions anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and happiness and shows how they cascade across our faces, providing clear signals to those who can identify the clues. As featured in Malcolm Gladwell's bestseller \"Blink,\" Ekman's Facial Action Coding System offers intense training in recognizing feelings in spouses, children, colleagues, even strangers on the street. In \"Emotions Revealed,\" Ekman distills decades of research into a practical, mind-opening, and life-changing guide to reading the emotions of those around us. He answers such questions as: How does our body signal to others whether we are slightly sad or anguished, peeved or enraged? Can we learn to distinguish between a polite smile and the genuine thing? Can we ever truly control our emotions? Packed with unique exercises and photographs, and a new chapter on emotions and lying that encompasses security and terrorism as well as gut decisions, \"Emotions Revealed\" is an indispensable resource for navigating our emotional world.\"",

            "abstract": "This article addresses methodological issues pertinent to judgment studies in nonverbal communication research, in general, and to the perception and attribution of emotions, in particular. We investigated which behavioral cues are used in portraying various emotions and to what extent the channel of presentation and encoding differences between actors affect judgment accuracy. In an encoding study the nonverbal behaviors of 6 different actors (3 male, 3 female) portraying four emotions (joy, sadness, anger, surprise) were analyzed from a videotape. In a decoding study these portrayals were shown using 4 channels of presentation (audio-video, video only, audio only, filtered audio), to groups of naive judges. The results indicate that different nonverbal cues are used to portray the various emotions and that differences between channels and between actors strongly affect decoding accuracy. Specifically, overemphasis of behavioral cues characteristic for certain emotions results in reduced decoding accuracy. Given the widespread assumption that nonverbal signal systems are particularly suitable for communicating affective information, it is not surprising that many researchers have attempted to study how well individuals can recognize different emotions from various nonverbal cues (for an overview of such studies, see Ekman, 1982; Scherer, 1981). One of the major obstades researchers have encountered in this area has been the problem of obtaining realistic stimulus material to present to judges; that is, obtaining nonverbal expressions that represent valid indicators of various emotional states. The ethical and practical difficulties in experimentally inducing strong emotional states, or even recording naturally occurring emotional experiences, has been one of the perennial problems in the scientific study of emotion. In studying the role of vocal cues in the communication of emotional meaning, this difficulty is aggravated because the researcher, in order to avoid interference from verbal content, usually wants to use standard verbal utterances with the same content for different emotions so as to focus on the different paralinguistic cues that carry the emotional meaning. Given these constraints, most researchers have taken recourse to emotional expression simulated or portrayed by actors using standard verbal material such as standard sentences, nonsense syllables, letters of the alphabet, and the like (see summary in",

            "abstract": "A novel system that analyzes timbral information of a live clarinet performance for expressive musical gesture is presented. This work is motivated by the growing need to accurately describe the subtle gestures and nuances of single-line acoustic instrument performances. MIDI has successfully satisfied this need for percussion-type instruments, such as the piano. However, a method for extracting gesture of other instruments, and a MIDI-like protocol by which computers may communicate about these gestures, has been lacking. The exploration of timbre attempts to fulfill the goal of deriving such a parameter stream from the clarinet. Timbre is a particularly evasive attribute of instrumental sound, yet one that is intimately tied to musical expression. This system uses Principle Component Analysis, a supervised pattern recognition technique, to extract musical gesture parameters based upon the timbre of an acoustic signal. These parametric descriptors can then be used as a control mechanism for interactive music systems, and as a means of deriving high level musical expression. Thesis Supervisor: Tod Machover Title: Associate Professor of Music and Media, MIT Media Laboratory This work is funded in part by the Yamaha Corporation and Sega of America. Acknowledgments Of all the people at the Lab who helped shape this thesis, I owe the most gratitude to Eric M6tois. His generous advice, pertinent ideas, and technical expertise were invaluable. Damon Horowitz, Eric, and Dan Ellis were exceptionally helpful by providing comments and corrections after sifting through my drafts. Dan was particularly encouraging at a time when I was losing focus and needed a boost. Michael Casey gave me the first glimpse of pattern recognition and helped direct my initial ideas. The Media Lab experience would not have been fulfilling without the friendship and talent of my \"partners in media\": Ed Hammond, Eric \"EMJ\" Jordan, Teresa Marrin, Fumi Matsumoto, Suzanne McDermott, Eric M6tois, Joe Paradiso, Pete \"Phat\" Rice, Josh Smith, David Waxman, Mike Wu, and John Underkoffler. In particular, my officemates Alex Rigopulos and Damon Horowitz have been an endless source of comedy, provocative ideas, support, and puerile behavior. I owe thanks to Michael Hawley for first showing me the lab when I was a UROP and exposing me to the world of media and music. Thanks to Aba and Ima for giving me the opportunities to grow and for being an enormous source of support. Offer, myfavorite brother, deserves special thanks for being a great friend and for putting up with me for so long. This thesis would not have been possible without the generous musical training I have received throughout the past twelve years. Thanks to my clarinet teachers Louise Goni, Jonathan Cohler, and Bill Wrzecien. Years of playing chamber music with Elaine Chew, Wilson Hsieh, Julia Ogrydziak, and Donald Yeung, among the many others, has taught me how to become a better musician and has even made MIT bearable. Finally, I'd like to warmly thank my advisor Tod Machover for his extraordinary support, amazing ideas, and encouraging advice. The unique environment he has set up for us at the Media Lab has allowed me to develop my interests, and explore this exciting field.",

            "abstract": "This paper deals with the effects of gesture on the sound signal\nproduced by an acoustic instrument and the modeling of these gestures.\nWe\nfocus on the effects of ancillary gestures, those not primarily\nintended to produce sound, but nevertheless omnipresent in\nhigh-level instrumentalists' technique. We show that even in the case\nof non-expressive performance of wind instruments, performers'\nancillary gestures appear in the observed sound by means of\nstrong partial amplitude's modulation. We claim that these\nmodulations account for a naturalness that is usually lacking in\ncurrent synthesis applications.\nWe have analyzed video recordings of clarinet performers in concert\nsituations and identified typical gesture patterns. In order to\ndemonstrate that these gestures are the main cause of the sound\npartial's modulation, we have undertaken an extensive set of clarinet,\noboe\nand saxophone recordings in different reproducible environments, such\nas an anechoic chamber and an variable acoustics auditorium. The\nrecordings were performed using multiple microphones at calibrated\npositions, always including one internal microphone. The notes were also\ninterpreted in three styles: expressive (quasi-jazz), non-expressive\nperformance and performance with the instrument kept completely\nimmobilized by a mechanical apparatus. Simultaneously, experiments\nwere done in order to determine the exact influence of the\ninstrument's radiation directivity, of the room reverberation and of\nthe instrument's mouthpiece. We studied more precisely the\neffects of the first reflection on the recorded sound when\nthe instrument is moved. This was achieved by comparing recordings\nperformed in an anechoic chamber using a removable wood floor placed\nunderneath the instrument and the microphone. Finally, we measured the\nauditorium response excited by a loudspeaker connected to a\nclarinet tube. The tube was then rotated in order to allow a precise\nsetting\nof its position according to standard performer gestures found in the\nanalyzed videos.\nThe sinusoidal partials of the sounds were then extracted using an\nadditive analysis procedure. Partials may exhibit amplitude modulations\nof more than 10 dB, even for low frequency partials and in the\ncase of non-expressive sound recordings.\nWe show through measurements and theoretical demonstrations that\nthese modulations are primarily caused by the influence of the\nperformer's ancillary gestures coupled with the room's acoustical\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, we show that even in highly reverberant\nrooms, modulations do not occur in the absence of ancillary gesture.\nMouthpiece and directional characteristics are demonstrated to have\ninfluence only in large amplitude movements, such as in deliberated\nmovements.\nFinally, a real-time synthesis model of a clarinet confirms these\nresults, where the instrument's radiation pattern and an early room\nresponse model based on measurements of the variable acoustics\nauditorium\nhave been implemented. Sound and video examples of performances using\nthis\nmodel will be presented during the conference.",

The violin, one of the most refined and expressive of traditional instruments, combines a peculiar physical interface with a rich acoustic diffuser. We have built a new instrument that includes elements of both the violin’s physical performance interface and its spatial filtering audio diffuser, yet eliminates both the resonating body and the strings. The instrument, BoSSA (Bowed-Sensor-Speaker-Array), is an amalgamation and extension of our previous work with violin interfaces, physical models, and directional tonal radiation studies. In addition to describing the various physical and software elements that make up BoSSA, we discuss some of its musical features and potentials; we are particularly impressed by the sense of presence and intimacy it provides, and by its potential for creating a new kind of electronic chamber music.",

Hand gestures are mapped continuously to 10 control parameters of a parallel formant speech synthesizer. The mapping allows the hand to act as an artificial vocal tract that produces speech in real time. This gives an unlimited vocabulary in addition to direct control of fundamental frequency and volume. Currently, the best version of Glove-TalkII uses several input devices (including a CyberGlove, a ContactGlove, a 3- space tracker, and a foot-pedal), a parallel formant speech synthesizer and 3 neural networks. The gesture-to-speech task is divided into vowel and consonant production by using a gating network to weight the outputs of a vowel and a consonant neural network. The gating network and the consonant network are trained with examples from the user. The vowel network implements a fixed, user-defined relationship between hand-position and vowel sound and does not require any training examples from the user. Volume, fundamental frequency and stop consonants are produced with a fixed mapping from the input devices. One subject has trained to speak intelligibly with Glove-TalkII. He speaks slowly with speech quality similar to a text-to-speech synthesizer but with far more natural-sounding pitch variations.",

            "abstract": "Standard laptop computers are now capable of sizeable quantities of sound synthesis and sound processing, but low-latency, high quality, multichannel audio I/O has not been possible without a cumbersome external card cage. CNMAT has developed a solution using the ubiquitous 100BaseT Ethernet that supports up to 10 channels of 24-bit audio, 64 channels of sample-synchronous control-rate gesture data, and 4 precisely time-stamped MIDI I/O streams. Latency measurements show that we can get signals into and back out of Max/MSP in under 7 milliseconds. The central component in the device is a field programmable gate array (FPGA). In addition to providing a variety of computer interface capabilities, the device can function as a cross-coder for a variety of protocols including GMICS. This paper outlines the motivation, design, and implementation of the connectivity processor. 1. Context and Prior Work Hardware development for computer music performance systems has followed the standard pattern of technology evolution passing through the first two phases of design focus, function and price, to the final phase: usability. We have identified size and connectivity as primary usability issues for computer music performance systems. Laptop computers have recently become available with fast signal processing capabilities at a moderate cost and although their size makes them very attractive for musical performance, their constrained expansion capabilities limit connectivity. Currently there are no commercially available, low-latency, high-reliability, compact, multi-channel audio solutions for laptop computers. Furthermore the architecture of current laptops and most computers makes it impossible to synchronize acquired gestural data and sound I/O to satisfy the low latency/jitter needed for satisfactory reactive performance systems: 10±1ms (Freed, et al., 1997). The 10 ms latency criterion is not difficult to meet, but a maximum latency variation of ±1ms is difficult to achieve, especially when the stimulus gesture is represented as a MIDI event or a low rate signal from a nonsample-synchronous input source like a data acquisition card rather than a sample-synchronized audio input signal. The only computers with the requisite unified clock management and operating systems support for such tight synchronization are from Silicon Graphics. Unfortunately, even the smallest configurations of their machines, the O2 and Octane are too large and expensive for most performing musicians. One of our key design goals was to eliminate virtually all latency variation in low sample rate inputs like those from gestural input devices.",

With digital analysis-based sound synthesis and with experiments on tone quality perception, we can obtain representations of sounds that suggest ways to provide low-dimensional control over their perceptually important properties. In this paper, we will describe a system for taking subjective measures of perceptual contrast between sound objects and using this data as input to some computer programs. The computer programs use multidimensional scaling algorithms to generate geometric representations from the input data. In the timbral spaces that result from the scaling programs, the various tones can be represented as points and a good statistical relationship can be sought between the distances in the space and the contrast judgments between the corresponding tones. The spatial representation is given a psychoacoustical interpretation by relating its dimensions to the acoustical properties of the tones. Controls are then applied directly to these properties in synthesis. The control schemes to be described are for additive synthesis and allow for the manipulation of the evolving spectral energy distribution and various temporal features of the tones. Tests of the control schemes have been carried out in musical contexts.* Particular emphasis will be given here to the construction of melodic lines in which the timbre is manipulated on a note-to-note basis. Implications for the design of human control interfaces and of software for real-time digital sound synthesizers will be discussed.",

Subjects carried out two tasks: in the first task four different input device types (mouse, relative joystick, absolute joystick and dataglove) were used to reach target positions in a perceptual space using audio-visual feedback; in the second task only the glove was used in audio-visual and auditory-only feedback conditions. Data was analysed for speed, accuracy and control integration (the amount of cross-dimensional motion) of the devices. Results indicate a highly significant effect of the choice of input device on the efficacy of timbre manipulation. The mouse was the fastest and most accurate device, then come the absolute joystick, relative joystick and glove. The glove scored significantly better in control integration with 3 out of 4 dimensions, which might indicate a closer correspondence of the perceptual structure of the timbre space with that of the glove. The visual 2 x 2-D representation had no significant effect on control integration and visual feedback did improve accuracy significantly, but not speed. These results have significant implications for the design of intuitive interfaces for direct control of sounds in composition and performance activities.",

Our approach consists in \nconsidering different mapping strategies in order to achieve \"fine\" (therefore in the authors' \nopinion, potentially expressive) control of additive synthesis by coupling originally independent \noutputs from the wind controller. These control dignals are applied to nine different clarinet data \nfiles obtained from analysis of clarinet sounds, which are arranged in an expressive timbral subspace \nand interpolated in real-time, using FTS 1.4, IRCAM's digital signal processing environment. An analysis \nof the resulting interpolation is also provided and topics related to sound morphing are discussed.",

In a traditional musical situation gesture usually produces sound. The relationship between gesture and sound is unique, it is a cause to effect link. In computer music, the possibility of uncoupling gesture from sound is due to the fact that computer can carry out all the aspects of sound production from composition up to interpretation and performance. Real time computing technology and development of human gesture tracking systems may enable gesture to be introduced again into the practice of computer music, but with a completely renewed approach. There is no more need to create direct cause to effect relationships for sound production, and gesture may be seen as another musical parameter to play with in the context of interactive musical performances.",

Nous proposons une methode qui consiste a identifier l’action gestuelle humaine sur un objet physique a un modele mecanique simple mais evolutif.

            "abstract": "Real time and gestual monitoring of the production of synthesised sound has been part of the permanent preoccupations of musical informatics since its beginning. The conditions imposed by the standard mode of communication with the computer and by the time taken by calculation at the start of musical informatics placed the musician in a situation far removed from his usual action or description modes, and, in particular, ruled out an instrumental type of relationship. Today, as real time synthesis has been possible for several years, numerous devices are being developed to meet the specific demands of the instrumental Relationship efficiently and in a differentiated way. However, in complete contrast to questions relative to synthesis or compositional models, gestual monitoring has given rise especially to technical developments, with a view to approaching as near as possible given traditional instrumental situations, at the expense of sufficient theoretical reflection focused fundamentally on the role of the instrumental gesture, its status and its application in an informatic tool for musical creation. It is, however, apparent that the instrumental gesture is not mere monitoring. In \" natural \" sound production by acoustic instruments, this gesture participates intimately with the physical phenomenon and directly determines some of its decisive attributes for perception and musicality. It has simultaneously a concrete function : required for sound production and a symbolic one : the instrument and its accompanying gesture are two causes that combine to produce the sound effect, and, for this reason, the sound effect bears the perceptual indices that are specifically related to the gesture. The indices may remain present and significant in the sound object when this contributes to the composition of a musical structure. In the perspective of creating concepts and pertinent tools for computer assisted musical creation, it seems vital to us to consider the question of the musical gesture more in depth that from purely superficial ergonomic considerations. The object of this paper is to present, whilst attempting to situate it in the general conceptual framework of composition, a particular point of view taking the instrumental gesture, via the computer, as an object that composition may operate on. From this we have deduced the functional specificities that should be included in the conception of a musical creation informatic tool.",

The system we present is the prototype of a more general device, and its construction is the result of research into the relationship between instrument and performer within the framework of a system for realtime sound synthesis and computer-assisted musical creation. The first feature of this device is that it is a gestural control system with feedback for the tactile senses-it enables actual fingering of a physical instrument to be simulated. The second important feature is that this is a modular system: the piano- or organ-type keyboard is its nominal form, but its mechanical morphology can be modified and easily configured for other applications or types of performance interfaces.",

It discusses the backgrounds of current synthesizer user interface design and related timbre space research. Of the three principal parameters of sound—pitch, loudness and timbre—ISEE focuses on control of timbre, and affects only the range of pitch and loudness. Timbre is manipulated using four abstract timbre parameters: overtones, brightness, articulation and envelope. These abstract timbre parameters are implemented in different ways for different instruments. They define instrument spaces of which a hierarchy can be built to structure refinement of timbre parameter behavior. An Apple Macintosh implementation of ISEE is described. ISEE has four main advantages over traditional sound synthesis editors. Firstly, it allows musicians to control sound synthesis as they control their musical instrument: by continuous movement, reducing cognitive control load. Secondly, it uses timbre parameters identified by human experience instead of indirect and intricate synthesis model parameters. Thirdly, it integrates a librarian system in the sound synthesis model. Finally, it enables transparent use of several synthesis models at a time.",

L'enjeu est, a terme, de livrer au musicien un veritable instrument de musique reproduisant le comportement d'un cuivre, tout en offrant des libertes et des possibilites d'expression nouvelles. La realisation de cet objectif necessite une approche pluridisciplinaire articulee autour de mesures, de modelisation et de simulations numeriques. Nous montrons comment un modele simple, complete par des relations semi-empiriques, reproduit une grande partie des comportements de la trompette. Nous montrons aussi que certaines relations empiriques peuvent etre justifiees par la prise en compte d'hypotheses plus complexes. Une interface de controle, permettant l'interaction en temps reel avec le modele, met en evidence sa richesse de comportements et rend possible son utilisation dans un cadre musical. Un etude theorique du modele selon le formalisme des systemes dynamiques est egalement menee. Elle permet d'expliquer, d'identifier ou meme de prevoir certains comportements du modele, ce qui est necessaire pour une utilisation musicale.",

This paper presents and discusses key issues in \" affective computing, \" computing that relates to, arises from, or influences emotions. Models are suggested for computer recognition of human emotion, and new applications are presented for computer-assisted learning, perceptual information retrieval, arts and entertainment, and human health and interaction. Affective computing, coupled with new wear-able computers, will also provide the ability to gather new data necessary for advances in emotion and cog-nition theory. Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. – Marie Curie Emotions have a stigma in science; they are believed to be inherently non-scientific. Scientific principles are derived from rational thought, logical arguments, testable hypotheses, and repeatable experiments. There is room alongside science for \" non-interfering \" emotions such as those involved in curiosity, frustration, and the pleasure of discovery. In fact, much scientific research has been prompted by fear. Nonetheless, the role of emotions is marginalized at best. Why bring \" emotion \" or \" affect \" into any of the deliberate tools of science? Moreover, shouldn't it be completely avoided when considering properties to design into computers? After all, computers control significant parts of our lives – the phone system, the stock market, nuclear power plants, jet landings, and more. Who wants a computer to be able to \" feel angry \" at them? To feel contempt for any living thing? In this essay I will submit for discussion a set of ideas on what I call \" affective computing, \" computing that relates to, arises from, or influences emotions. This will need some further clarification which I shall attempt below.

To achieve this goal, we combine two types of methodology: analysis of data from interviews with dancers and analysis of their dance performances. Our findings reveal that while dancing, in order to create their movements, improvisational dancers interact with various stimuli that come from inside and outside of themselves (for example, images and feelings that they entertain during their dancing, and the music, space and audience of their dance performances). Through such interactions, dancers organize movements in their performances extemporarily, using various expressive techniques (for example, changing speed or image intentionally and seeing themselves from the viewpoint of a third person). Keywords: Improvisation; Contemporary dance; Creativity Introduction What happens in artists’ minds when they generate their expressions or works? Recently research interest in artistic creation has been growing. There have been some empirical studies in psychology and cognitive science focused on artistic creation (e.g., Yokochi & Okada (2005) on Chinese ink painting, Tsuchikura (2010) on movie making, Tayanagi (2010) on jazz music, and Goan & Tujita (2007) on stage direction). Of the various forms of art, this study seeks to reveal the process of artistic creation empirically by focusing on dance, in particular improvisational contemporary dance. Improvisation plays a critical role in the process of artistic expression. Sasaki, a scholar of aesthetics, has pointed out the importance of improvisation as follows: “In the exact moment of their generation, expressions in the artistic genres, such as fine arts, music, and drama are not generated based on predetermined plans, but based on impromptu activities” (Sasaki, 1995). Thus, it can be considered that improvisation exists as an essential part of the process of artistic expression. Improvisational dance is one form of artistic expression in which such a process of improvisation saliently appears. Because improvisational dance presents audiences with the process of dance creation itself, making dance movements based on predetermined plans or repeating movements during dance performance is meaningless. Therefore, the process of improvisational dance contains the essence of artistic creation and expression. Previous studies in the domain of dance have pointed out the importance of improvisation in the creation of dance works, and the importance of impromptu expressions themselves (Fukumoto, 2007; 2009; Hosokawa, 2011; De Spain, 1997; Ribeiro & Fonseca, 2011; Soma & Hosokawa, 2007; Tsujimoto, 2010). Reviewing previous studies focused on how historically eminent dancers used improvisation to express themselves or create their dance works, Tsujimoto (2010) emphasized the significance of improvisation in dance. Tsujimoto (2010) also described an anecdote that when dancing extemporarily, the dancer's body instantly responded to stimuli from dance partners, the surrounding environment, and sensations born within the body. Through reviews of previous studies, Ribeiro & Fonseca (2011) also reported dancers’ experience while dancing extemporarily. They suggested that improvisational dance is formed by “the interaction of the body with the environment and the affective and cognitive systems” (Ribeiro & Fonseca, 2011). Although these studies offer useful insights, these findings are based on reviews and anecdotal evidence, rather than on empirical evidence. They did not empirically investigate what stimuli dancers interact with in the process of improvisation or how dancers create their works. In contrast, using information from reviews of a dancer’s works, interviews with her, and field experiments, Hosokawa (2011) studied the process and skills of improvisational dance, focusing on Kei Takei, a famous contemporary dancer. On the basis of the results of the study, Hosokawa (2011) suggests that Kei Takei generates movement sequences intuitively based on her physical skill, and polishes movement sequences to develop her dance work in keeping with her dance philosophy. De Spain (1997) constructed a theoretical model about the process of solo dance improvisation through interviews and introspective reports with improvisers of dance. De Spain’s model broke down the elements of improvisation into the categories of physical operands/operators, cognitive/affective operands/operators, determination, and attention. “The model also emphasized the importance of considering the existing state and flow of the improvisation at the moment of new action/interaction” (De Spain, 1997). Although Hosokawa (2011) and De Spain (1997) revealed",

The effects of attention regulation on social functioning were mediated by resiliency, and this relation was moderated by negative emotionality at the first, but not second, assessment. Negative emotionality moderated the relation of behavior regulation to socially appropriate/prosocial behavior. These results highlight the importance of examining different types of regulation and the ways in which dispositional characteristics interact in predicting social outcomes.",

Using a community-based sample of adolescent children of alcoholics (COAs) and a demographically matched comparison group (non-COAs), life stress, negative affect, behavioral undercontrol and alcohol use were assessed. Results showed that the stress and negative affect model predicted alcohol use. Consistent with theoretical predictions and previous research, negative affect partially mediated the relation between stress and alcohol use.

Growth curve analyses demonstrated that in comparison to children of the other 2 types, children of the resilient personality type had higher levels of academic achievement and lower levels of concentration problems throughout adolescence; resilient children also developed sophisticated friendship reasoning and an internal locus of control more quickly. Children of the overcontrolled type were found to be more prone to social withdrawal and low levels of self-esteem during adolescence than children of the other 2 types. In contrast to the other 2 types, children classified as undercontrolled showed an increase in aggressive behavior in adolescence.

In Study 1, 585 boys and girls classified into groups called reactive aggressive, proactive aggressive, pervasively aggressive (combined type), and nonaggressive revealed distinct profiles. Only the reactive aggressive groups demonstrated histories of physical abuse and early onset of problems, adjustment problems in peer relations, and inadequate encoding and problem-solving processing patterns. Only the proactive aggressive groups demonstrated a processing pattern of anticipating positive outcomes for aggressing. In Study 2, 50 psychiatrically impaired chronically violent boys classified as reactively violent or proactively violent demonstrated differences in age of onset of problem behavior, adjustment problems, and processing problems.",

Children generally reported the most problems and teachers the least. Agreement was highest between mothers and fathers on internalizing and externalizing problems, and lowest for rater pairs involving teachers on internalizing problems. Analyses of a multitrait-multimethod matrix for ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems indicated good convergent validity, large rater effects, and weaker discriminant validity. Conditional probabilities for agreement on deviant and nondeviant scores indicated that ratings by no informant could substitute for those of any other rater. Teacher ratings of externaliz...",

This paper provides automated methods for identifying logically similar motions in a data set and using them to build a continuous and intuitively parameterized space of motions. To find logically similar motions that are numerically dissimilar, our search method employs a novel distance metric to find \"close\" motions and then uses them as intermediaries to find more distant motions. Search queries are answered at interactive speeds through a precomputation that compactly represents all possibly similar motion segments. Once a set of related motions has been extracted, we automatically register them and apply blending techniques to create a continuous space of motions. Given a function that defines relevant motion parameters, we present a method for extracting motions from this space that accurately possess new parameters requested by the user. Our algorithm extends previous work by explicitly constraining blend weights to reasonable values and having a run-time cost that is nearly independent of the number of example motions. We present experimental results on a test data set of 37,000 frames, or about ten minutes of motion sampled at 60 Hz.",

        "title": "Musical Gestures: concepts and methods in research",
        "abstract": "In the last decade, cognitive science underwent a change of paradigm by bringing human movement into the focus of research. Concepts such as ‘embodiment’ and ‘enactive’ have been proposed as core concepts reflecting the role of the human body in complex processes such as action and perception, and the interaction of mind and physical environment (Varela et al., 1991; Noë, 2004). In music research, human movement has often been related with the notion of gesture. The reason is that many musical activities (performance, conducting, dancing) involve body movements that evoke meanings, and therefore these movements are called gestures. In Camurri et al. (2005), musical gestures are addressed from the viewpoint of their expressive character. However, there are many ways in which music-related body movements can be approached, measured, described and applied. Accordingly, there are many ways in which musical gestures are meaningful. Given the different contexts in which gestures appear, and their close relationship to movement and meaning, one may be tempted to say that the notion of gesture is too broad, ill-defined and perhaps too vague. Yet the use of this notion is very convenient in modern music research, because it allows making a bridge between movement and meaning. A closer look at the term gesture reveals its potential as a core notion that provides access to central issues in action/perception processes and in mind/environment interactions.",

Deux aspects de cette etude sont abordes : 1/ une analyse preliminaire sur la typologie du geste instrumental conduit a proposer un codage du geste qui traduit une organisation spatiale et temporelle des donnees gestuelles captees. Ces fondements nous servent de support pour concevoir et realiser un systeme materiel et logiciel, permettant la capture, le codage et le pretraitement en temps reel des signaux gestuels. 2/ L’etude est ensuite focalisee vers la recherche d’un espace de representation structurelle du geste, qui traduit une certaine forme d’expressivite de l’action gestuelle. Nous proposons une methode qui consiste a identifier l’action gestuelle humaine sur un objet physique a un modele mecanique simple mais evolutif. Ce principe conduit a une description homogene du geste de l’instrument qui tient compte de la coherence de l’interaction homme-objet manipule, et peut constituer un point d’entree a une approche structurelle de composition par gestes.",

Choreographed dance and music have been coupled in many works, despite being very different modalities for expression. Nonetheless, Krumhansl and Schenk found subjects could detect structural and emotional similarities in the recording of the Divertimento No.15 by Mozart or the recording of the accompanying dance by Balanchine [2]. The gestures considered in this research, namely improvised movements to sound, are both expressive and also necessarily the result of the dancer’s musical perception. Similarly, the study of sound-accompanying or “mimicking” gestures is expected to uncover aspects of the mental representation of gesture-sound relationships as well as the more general perception of sound [3].",

            "abstract": "Digital media handles music as encoded physical energy, but humans consider music in terms of beliefs, intentions, interpretations, experiences, evaluations, and significations. In this book, drawing on work in computer science, psychology, brain science, and musicology, Marc Leman proposes an embodied cognition approach to music research that will help bridge this gap. Assuming that the body plays a central role in all musical activities, and basing his approach on a hypothesis about the relationship between musical experience (mind) and sound energy (matter), Leman argues that the human body is a biologically designed mediator that transfers physical energy to a mental level -- engaging experiences, values, and intentions -- and, reversing the process, transfers mental representation into material form. He suggests that this idea of the body as mediator offers a promising framework for thinking about music mediation technology. Leman proposes that, under certain conditions, the natural mediator (the body) can be extended with artificial technology-based mediators. He explores the necessary conditions and analyzes ways in which they can be studied. Leman outlines his theory of embodied music cognition, introducing a model that describes the relationship between a human subject and its environment, analyzing the coupling of action and perception, and exploring different degrees of the body's engagement with music. He then examines possible applications in two core areas: interaction with music instruments and music search and retrieval in a database or digital library. The embodied music cognition approach, Leman argues, can help us develop tools that integrate artistic expression and contemporary technology.",

Touch, not vision, should be our model for perception. Perception is not a process in the brain, but a kind of skillful activity of the body as a whole. We enact our perceptual experience. To perceive, according to this enactive approach to perception, is not merely to have sensations; it is to have sensations that we understand. In Action in Perception, Noe investigates the forms this understanding can take. He begins by arguing, on both phenomenological and empirical grounds, that the content of perception is not like the content of a picture; the world is not given to consciousness all at once but is gained gradually by active inquiry and exploration. Noe then argues that perceptual experience acquires content thanks to our possession and exercise of practical bodily knowledge, and examines, among other topics, the problems posed by spatial content and the experience of color. He considers the perspectival aspect of the representational content of experience and assesses the place of thought and understanding in experience. Finally, he explores the implications of the enactive approach for our understanding of the neuroscience of perception.",

Research into this has tended either to be of the “analysis-by-synthesis” variety (e.g. Sundberg, 1988) or performance analysis (Shaffer, Todd and others). This paper examines the relationship between the generative basis of expression around which both these approaches have been based and the role played by directly mimetic and acoustical representations and by body movement. Two studies of performers' attempts to reproduce different types of performances, either real performances or artificial transformations of real performances, are discussed. The results of these studies appear to support the generative/representational approach to performance expression, but it is suggested that a capacity for direct mimesis may play a significant role in determining expression in performance.

Seashore and his co-workers at Iowa University in the 1930s. The second part presents a model for interplay between analysis and synthesis in studies of music performance and its relationship to listeners9 experience of the music. The model means that music performance is analyzed with regard to various physical properties, and their relationships to listeners9 experience are investigated by means of synthesized sound sequences that are systematically varied in different aspects. In the third part, this idea is illustrated by examples from an extensive research project on musical rhythm. It is shown that performance of musical rhythm is characterized by various systematic variations regarding the durations of the sound events relative to strict mechanical regularity and that these variations may be related to various aspects of the experienced rhythm.",

In that music research space, there is a natural and emergent demand for an approach in which boundaries of object-centred and subject-centred research methodologies can be crossed. By putting music and embodied music experiences at the very centre of this research focus, systematic musicology can play an important role as moderator of a trans-disciplinary approach to music research. Evidence for the new position of systematic musicology in the modern European music research space is found in networks that foster systematic musicology, in a recent strategic roadmap for sound and music computing, commissioned by the European Commission, and in two recent National project initiatives, one in Finland and one in Belgium, that support long term research in the domain of systematic musicology.",

Most algorithms deal with FER as a pure classification problem, assuming that expressions are exclusive to each other. In this letter, the problem of FER is tackled from a more detailed view: learning to discriminate expressions with consideration of the secondary information. We propose the Secondary Information aware Facial Expression Network (SIFE-Net) to explore the latent components without auxiliary labeling, and we propose a novel dynamic weighting strategy to teach the SIFE-Net. In contrast to traditional classifiers trained with one-hot labels, the proposed SIFE-Net takes advantage of secondary expression information and has more rational feature distributions. We carry out extensive experiments and analysis on three widely-used FER datasets, i.e. the CK+ dataset, the JAFFE dataset, and the RAF dataset. Experimental results show that the SIFE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.",

Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that attention can also play an important role in the context of applying artificial neural networks to a variety of tasks from fields such as computer vision and NLP. In this work we show that, by properly defining attention for convolutional neural networks, we can actually use this type of information in order to significantly improve the performance of a student CNN network by forcing it to mimic the attention maps of a powerful teacher network. To that end, we propose several novel methods of transferring attention, showing consistent improvement across a variety of datasets and convolutional neural network architectures.

Recent studies show that deep learning approaches can achieve impressive performance on these two tasks. In this letter, we propose a deep cascaded multitask framework that exploits the inherent correlation between detection and alignment to boost up their performance. In particular, our framework leverages a cascaded architecture with three stages of carefully designed deep convolutional networks to predict face and landmark location in a coarse-to-fine manner. In addition, we propose a new online hard sample mining strategy that further improves the performance in practice. Our method achieves superior accuracy over the state-of-the-art techniques on the challenging face detection dataset and benchmark and WIDER FACE benchmarks for face detection, and annotated facial landmarks in the wild benchmark for face alignment, while keeps real-time performance.",

            "abstract": "We present an approach that combines automatic features learned by convolutional neural networks (CNN) and handcrafted features computed by the bag-of-visual-words (BOVW) model in order to achieve the state-of-the-art results in facial expression recognition (FER). To obtain automatic features, we experiment with multiple CNN architectures, pre-trained models, and training procedures, e.g., Dense–Sparse–Dense. After fusing the two types of features, we employ a local learning framework to predict the class label for each test image. The local learning framework is based on three steps. First, a k-nearest neighbors model is applied in order to select the nearest training samples for an input test image. Second, a one-versus-all support vector machines (SVM) classifier is trained on the selected training samples. Finally, the SVM classifier is used to predict the class label only for the test image it was trained for. Although we have used local learning in combination with handcrafted features in our previous work, to the best of our knowledge, local learning has never been employed in combination with deep features. The experiments on the 2013 FER Challenge data set, the FER+ data set, and the AffectNet data set demonstrate that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results. With a top accuracy of 75.42% on the FER 2013, 87.76% on the FER+, 59.58% on the AffectNet eight-way classification, and 63.31% on the AffectNet seven-way classification, we surpass the state-of-the-art methods by more than 1% on all data sets.",

However, studying labels and their properties has received very little attention. Current principles and paradigms of labeling impose several challenges to machine learning algorithms. Labels are often incomplete, ambiguous, and redundant. In this paper we study the effects of various properties of labels and introduce the Label Refinery: an iterative procedure that updates the ground truth labels after examining the entire dataset. We show significant gain using refined labels across a wide range of models. Using a Label Refinery improves the state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of (1) AlexNet from 59.3 to 67.2, (2) MobileNet from 70.6 to 73.39, (3) MobileNet-0.25 from 50.6 to 55.59, (4) VGG19 from 72.7 to 75.46, and (5) Darknet19 from 72.9 to 74.47.",

            "abstract": "Accurate age estimation from a facial image is quite challenging, since physical age and apparent age can be quite different, and this difference is dependent on gender, ethnicity, and many other factors. Multitask deep learning is one of the approach to improve age estimation by employing auxiliary tasks, such as gender recognition, that are related to the primary task. However, in traditional multitask learning for age estimation, the relationship between the primary and auxiliary tasks is difficult to describe; how the auxiliary tasks enhance the model for the primary objective is ambiguous. In this letter, we propose a conditional multitask learning method that architecturally factorizes an age variable into gender-conditioned age probabilities in a deep neural network. The lack of accurate training labels with discrete age values is another critical limitation to training age estimation models. Therefore, we propose a label expansion method that increases the number of accurate labels from weakly supervised categorical labels. To verify the generality of the proposed method, we perform intensive experiments on the publicly available MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets. The proposed methods outperform state-of-the art methods in both age estimation and gender recognition accuracy. These performance gains are verified on well-known deep network architectures—VGG-16, CASIA-WebFace, and Alexnet—to confirm the proposed methods generality.",

In this paper, we present a deep mutual learning (DML) strategy. Different from the one-way transfer between a static pre-defined teacher and a student in model distillation, with DML, an ensemble of students learn collaboratively and teach each other throughout the training process. Our experiments show that a variety of network architectures benefit from mutual learning and achieve compelling results on both category and instance recognition tasks. Surprisingly, it is revealed that no prior powerful teacher network is necessary - mutual learning of a collection of simple student networks works, and moreover outperforms distillation from a more powerful yet static teacher.",

            "abstract": "Despite the fact that deep neural networks are powerful models and achieve appealing results on many tasks, they are too gigantic to be deployed on edge devices like smart-phones or embedded sensor nodes. There has been efforts to compress these networks, and a popular method is knowledge distillation, where a large ( a.k.a. teacher) pre-trained network is used to train a smaller ( a.k.a. student) network. However, in this paper, we show that the student network performance de-grades when the gap between student and teacher is large. Given a ﬁxed student network, one cannot employ an arbitrarily large teacher, or in other words, a teacher can effectively transfer its knowledge to students up to a certain size, not smaller. To alleviate this shortcoming, we introduce multi-step knowledge distillation which employs an intermediate-sized network ( a.k.a. teacher assistant) to bridge the gap between the student and the teacher. We study the effect of teacher assistant size and extend the framework to multi-step distillation. Moreover, empirical and theoretical analysis are conducted to analyze the teacher assistant knowledge distillation framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and plain CNN and ResNet architectures substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

This paper examines the role of sound in enabling such immersion and argues that, even in 'realism' FPS games, it may be achieved sonically through a focus on caricature rather than realism. The paper utilizes and develops previous work in which both a conceptual framework for the design and analysis of run and gun FPS sound is developed and the notion of the relationship between player and FPS soundscape as an acoustic ecology is put forward (Grimshaw and Schott 2007a; Grimshaw and Schott 2007b). Some problems of sound practice and sound reproduction in the game are highlighted and a conceptual solution is proposed.",

In this study, we hypothesized that emotion expression alters behavior in morally charged negotiation. We investigated the impact of facial displays of discrete emotions, specifically anger and sadness, in a morally charged multi-issue negotiation task. Our results indicate that if a negotiator associated moral significance to the object of the negotiation, displays of anger resulted in reduced concession making whereas displays of sadness increased concession making. Moral significance of the issues fostered an emotional matching mechanism of sorrow, where a sorrow expression from one party elicited a sorrow expression from the other. Taken together, the results indicate that emotional expressions can affect morally charged negotiation in ways that can inhibit as well as promote cooperation.",

            "abstract": "Because Officers are charged with counseling and mentoring their subordinates, successful leaders in the United States Army must possess strong interpersonal skills (Headquarters, Department of the Army, 2006, 2008, 2011). Most Officers, however, develop their interpersonal skills on the job. Further, what formal training they receive consists primarily of live role-play sessions, which can fail to provide consistent practice, effective feedback, or accurate skill assessment and improvement. To address these issues, we have created a virtual-human-based roleplaying environment. The Virtual Officer Leadership Trainer (VOLT) is a controlled practice environment that allows instructor management and facilitates throughput. Trainees learn interpersonal skills, see demonstrations of the skills being used correctly, and then practice the skills interacting with a virtual human via branching, scripted dialogue that allows the trainee to apply specific skills. The trainees in the classroom observe this interaction in real time. At each decision point in the interaction, trainees use personal response systems (“clickers”) to indicate what they believe to be the correct course of action. These data are available to an instructor who monitors the class’s performance and conducts an after-action review. VOLT thus allows an entire class to participate in a single roleplay exercise, stimulating discussion, and facilitating peer and instructor evaluation in real time. VOLT’s instructional design is based on cognitive task analyses with expert leaders, which identified a set of learning objectives. This paper discusses VOLT’s educational goals, instructional design, technological approach, and program evaluation plan.",

In this case there is a broken mirror, a mirror that does not respond to the infants cues, so there is a mirror that looks and not a mirror in which one can look upon (Winnicott, 1971, p. 182). The infant looks but cannot see itself in this mirror. As described by Meekums (2002) the mirroring of the mother gives a meaning to the infant of a world, which is so little is known by him/her and so they are co-creating the universe they live in.",

Our approach targets close-range human capture and interaction where dense 3D estimation of hands and faces is desired. We use hybrid classification-regression forests to learn how to map from near infrared intensity images to absolute, metric depth in real-time. We demonstrate a variety of human-computer interaction and capture scenarios. Experiments show an accuracy that outperforms a conventional light fall-off baseline, and is comparable to high-quality consumer depth cameras, but with a dramatically reduced cost, power consumption, and form-factor.",

This article contributes to that reinvigoration by reviewing the use of the concept of ‘character’, considering whether the evidence supports the notion of ‘emotional character’ as a psychological construct, and suggesting new prospects for research on emotional character in embodied learning contexts such as the performing arts. Using the example of dance, it is argued that, while expertise requires training to develop concrete skills and good habits of mind to improve performance, becoming a dance artist requires something more. The performing arts communicate emotional ‘felt’ experience. The idea of emotional character describes an individual’s propensity to experience and express those feelings that create connection: to self, society, and the natural world. The aim of this essay is to remind those of us charged with the development of others that artistry goes beyond ability and that, in training, feeling is as important as thinking or doing.",

The cross-cultural study, which used data from the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (Murdock & White, 1969), found that for preindustrial societies, as loyalty to the ingroup increased the tendency to value outgroup violence more than ingroup violence increased, as did the tendencies to engage in more external than internal warfare, and enjoy war. The experimental study found that relative to guilt-prone group members who were instructed to remain objective, guilt-prone group members who were instructed to be empathic with their ingroup were more competitive in an intergroup interaction. The findings from these studies suggest that group morality is associated with intergroup conflict.",

Recent research in social cognition suggests that \"warmth,\" broadly construed, should be of prime importance in impression formation. Yet, some prior research suggests that information about others' specifically moral traits--their moral \"character\"--may be a primary dimension. Although warmth and character have sometimes been conceived of as interchangeable, we argue that they are separable, and that across a wide variety of contexts, character is usually more important than warmth in impression formation. We first showed that moral character and social warmth traits are indeed separable (Studies 1 and 2). Further studies that used correlational and experimental methods showed that, as predicted, in most contexts, moral character information is more important in impression formation than is warmth information (Studies 2-6). Character information was also more important than warmth information with respect to judgments of traits' perceived fundamentalness to identity, their uniquely human quality, their context-independence, and their controllability (Study 2). Finally, Study 7 used an archival method to show that moral character information appears more prominently than warmth information in obituaries, and more strongly determines the impressions people form of the individuals described in those obituaries. We discuss implications for current theories of person perception and social cognition.",

In contrast to the largely disembodied sociological literature of the body, this book places the corporeal body as central to the examination and reveals significant relationships between body, society and identity. Drawing on academic scholarship as well as rich ballet body narratives from young dancers, this book investigates how young ballet dancers' bodies are lived, experienced and constructed through their desire to become performing ballet dancers as well as the seductive appeal of the ballet aesthetic. Pierre Bourdieu's critique of the perpetuating social order and his theoretical framework of field, habitus and capital are applied as a way of understanding the social world of ballet but also of relating the ballet habitus and belief in the body to broader social structures. This book examines the distinctiveness of ballet culture and aspects of young ballet dancers' embodied identity through a central focus on the ballet body.",

            "abstract": "This paper attempts an exhaustive review of the literature on the psychotherapeutic relationship. The nature of the ideal psychotherapeutic relationship is defined and approximations of this ideal are shown to correlate positively with various measures of patient progress in the therapeutic enterprise. Other correlates of good therapeutic relationships are then explored: patient variables, therapist variables, therapistpatient similarity, and technique variables. In all these areas, significant correlations are found, though not as often as one might expect. The research on therapist variables is especially disappointing, while patient variables seem to be quite good predictors of the quality of the ensuing patient-therapist relationship. Methodological issues are considered throughout the paper. Psychotherapy has been variously defined. In this paper, it will refer to a warm, permissive, safe, understanding, but limited social relationship within which therapist and patient discuss the affective behavior of the latter, including his ways of dealing with his emotionally toned needs and the situations that give rise to them [Shoben, 1953, p. 1271. Some writers on the subject of psychotherapy have focused on the \"within which aspects, citing numerous techniques as being more or less beneficial. Others have focused on the fact that psychotherapy is a relationship, and they have asserted that factors directly associated with this phenomenon contribute significantly to success or failure. This paper addresses itself to the validity of the latter assertion. The literature cited covers the period 1946-62.",

The respondents to the questionnaire were also clear about the difference between DMT and other neighbouring fields. For example, distinctions were made between DMT and dance teaching. Dance movement therapists insisted that they did not teach anyone how to dance; the dance as an end product did not have as much importance (if any importance at all) as it would have for most dance teachers. The similarities between the two modalities referred to by Jordan (1988), may have arisen from an approach to dance education based upon Laban’s modern educational dance (Laban, 1975) and also a child-centred view of education (which was particularly widespread among teachers and also officially endorsed, when Jordan’s research was conducted) where the process is considered to be of fundamental importance."

Through creating parameterized motions-which the authors call verbs parameterized by adverbs-a single authored verb produces a continuous range of subtle variations of a given motion at real-time rates. As a result, simulated figures alter their actions based on their momentary mood or in response to changes in their goals or environmental stimuli. For example, they demonstrate a walk verb that can show emotions such as happiness and sadness, and demonstrate subtle variations due to walking up or down hill while turning to the left and right. They also describe verb graphs, which act as the glue to assemble verbs and their adverbs into a runtime data structure. Verb graphs provide the means for seamless transition from verb to verb for the simulated figures within an interactive runtime system. Finally they briefly discuss the discrete event simulator that handles the runtime main loop.",

Here we propose a new model that simultaneously accounts for both regularities by replacing the 2/3 power law with a smoothness constraint. For a given path of the hand in space, our model assumes that the speed profile will be the one that minimizes the third derivative of position (or \"jerk\"). Analysis of the mathematical relationship between this smoothness constraint and the 2/3 power law revealed that in both two and three dimensions, the power law is equivalent to setting the jerk along the normal to the path to zero; it generates speed predictions that are similar, but clearly distinguishable from the predictions of our model. We have assessed the accuracy of the model on a number of motor tasks in two and three dimensions, involving discrete movements along arbitrary paths, traced with different limb segments. The new model provides a very close fit to the observed speed profiles in all cases. Its performance is uniformly better compared with all existing versions of the 2/3 power law, suggesting that the correlation between speed and curvature may be a consequence of an underlying motor strategy to produce smooth movements. Our results indicate that the relationship between the path and the speed profile of a complex arm movement is stronger than previously thought, especially within a single trial. The accuracy of the model was quite uniform over movements of different shape, size, and average speed. We did not find evidence for segmentation, yet prediction error increased with movement duration, suggesting a continuous fluctuation of the \"tempo\" of discrete movements. The implications of these findings for motor planning and on-line control are discussed.",

            "abstract": "It is an ancient, and very pervasive, idea that music expresses emotion. Apart from the copious literature to this effect contributed by composers, musicologists, and philosophers, there is also solid empirical evidence from psychological research, reviewed in chapters of this book (e.g. Gabrielsson & Lindstrom, this volume; Juslin, this volume), that listeners often agree rather strongly about what type of emotion is expressed in a particular piece. It is also a pervasive belief that music can, at times, actually produce emotion in listeners. The distinction between perception and production is related to the distinction between cognitivism and emotivism proposed by philosophers in their analysis of emotion in music (e.g. Kivy 1989). Whereas 'emotivists' hold that music elicits real emotional responses in listeners, 'cognitivists' argue that music simply expresses or represents emotions. Our view is that it would be premature to prejudge the issue and that both positions may be perfectly appropriate depending on a number of factors outlined below. Our purpose in this chapter is to provide a formalization of the processes whereby music produces emotional effects in the listener that go beyond the cognitive inference of what the music can be said to express. In addition, we review the pertinent evidence to date and suggest ways in which future research might investigate these processes in a systematic fashion. We state at the outset that our discussion and the review of the available evidence are largely based on Western classical music, thereby restricting the generalizability of our claims to other kinds of music and other cultures. Our attempt at a formalization of emotional effects of music will consist in defining the affective changes that music is supposed to produce in the listener and to identify the determinants of the listening situation (features such as the musical structure of the piece listened to, the interpretation by the performer, relevant state and trait characteristics of the listener, and the respective context). An important issue for discussion will be the relative weighting of the different determinants and the type of their interaction in producing the affective outcome. We follow the senior author's attempt to define the emotional meaning of music in analogy to Buhler's Organon model of language, postulating composition, expression, perception, and production rules to model the different facets of emotional meaning (Scherer, 2000d). In this context, the term rule is used to denote a certain regularity or lawfulness of the effects discussed that can be expressed in concrete predictions or hypotheses. It is not excluded that these rules can be integrated into attempts at computational modelling of the underlying mechanisms (in fact, we consider this a highly desirable option), but we do not feel that the current state of the",

        "abstract": "Human-AI co-creativity involves humans and AI collaborating on a shared creative product as partners. In a creative collaboration, communication is an essential component among collaborators. In many existing co-creative systems, users can communicate with the AI, usually using buttons or sliders. Typically, the AI in co-creative systems cannot communicate back to humans, limiting their potential to be perceived as partners rather than just a tool. This paper presents a study with 38 participants to explore the impact of two interaction designs, with and without AI-to-human communication, on user engagement, collaborative experience and user perception of a co-creative AI. The study involves user interaction with two prototypes of a co-creative system that contributes sketches as design inspirations during a design task. The results show improved collaborative experience and user engagement with the system incorporating AI-to-human communication. Users perceive co-creative AI as more reliable, personal, and intelligent when the AI communicates to users. The findings can be used to design effective co-creative systems, and the insights can be transferred to other fields involving human-AI interaction and collaboration.",

These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Moreover, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, hundreds of twitter users have posted their own artistic experiments using our system. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without handengineering our loss functions either.",

We arrive at the conclusion that adapting creative software for supporting human-computer cocreation requires redesigning some major aspects of the software, which guides our on-going project of building an interactive poetry composition tool.",

The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between virtuality in the workplace and social capital.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nUsing an online survey, the authors recruited 152 female student workers using an opportunity sampling approach.\n\n\nFindings\nParticipants who used social media at work (n=112) reported higher social capital overall than participants who did not use any social media to communicate with colleagues at work (n=40). This difference also presented itself in terms of the social capital subscales (network ties, shared vision and trust). Mediation analysis conducted with users of social media at work revealed that social media use was a significant mediator in the relationship between virtuality at work and social capital overall (partial mediation). Subsequent analyses with the subscales for virtuality and social capital suggested full mediation of the relationship in most instances (with the exception of work practices).\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis is the first study to examine the relationship between virtuality, social media and social capital at work. The result of this study suggests that social media use at work between colleagues can play a significant role in promoting social capital in workplaces that are heavily reliant on technological application to support interactions at work and feature geographical and temporal dispersion.\n",

However, integration of communication mediums and their application in pedagogy do not appear to receive the attention they deserve outwith marketing and social psychology research. This is to the determinant of AEC industries where the forefront of proximal communication extends to video conferencing and high latency sharing of open standard models. Underutilisation is not just a missed opportunity; it is the source of many cascading conflicts, trust issues and delivery failures in in AEC projects. Although effective communication will not resolve all problems, those associated with its absence are unnecessarily endemic. Through discussion of the antecedents of trust and the social presence principles that underpin effective communication, this paper proposes the next disruptive innovation in industry should be a paradigm shift in its approach to communication.",

Human-computer co-creativity researchers assume that instead of using computational systems to merely automate creative tasks, computational creativity methods can be leveraged to design computational collaborators capable of sharing creative responsibility with a human collaborator. This has potential for extending both human and computational creative capability. This thesis focuses on the case of one human and one computational collaborator. More specifically this thesis studies how children collaborate with a computational collaborator called the Poetry Machine in the linguistically creative task of writing poems. This thesis investigates three topics related to human-computer co-creativity: The design of human-computer co-creative systems, their evaluation and the modelling of human-computer co-creative processes. These topics are approached from two perspectives: an interaction design perspective and a computational creativity perspective. The interaction design perspective provides practical methods for the design and evaluation of interactive systems as well as methodological frameworks for analysing design practices in the field. The computational creativity perspective then again provides a theoretical view to the evaluation and modelling of human-computer cocreativity. The thesis itself consists of five papers.",

In an AI-driven cooperative game with partially observable information, players (be it the AI or the human player) require their actions to be interpreted accurately by the other player to yield a successful outcome. In this paper, we investigate social perceptions of AI agents with various directions of communication in a cooperative game setting. We measure subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human and the nature of the communication (responsiveness and leading roles). We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=199) of this collaborative game and find significant differences in gameplay outcome and social perception across different AI agents, different directions of communication and when the agent is perceived to be an AI/Human. We find that the bias against the AI that has been demonstrated in prior studies varies with the direction of the communication and with the AI agent.",

Quantitative scoring criteria were developed that reflect the extent to which different individuals consistently produce similar constellations of acoustic attributes in response to the same emotional context. The scoring procedure was applied to the voice tracks of standard utterances produced by 11 subjects reading 10 different emotionally evocative scripts. The results supported the hypothesis that different individuals produce standard acoustic configurations to express emotions. Because acoustic properties reflecting contrastive stress consistently varied with emotional context over syntactically and semantically identical utterances, some factor related to emotional context other than syntax or semantics must account for the variations. An evolutionary argument that emotion communication can be seen as intention communication is presented to account for these variations. Implications for theories of emotions and of intentional generative semantics are discussed.",

The latter is explained by (a) a paucity of research on voice quality, (b) neglect of the social signaling functions of affect vocalization, and (c) insufficiently precise conceptualization of the underlying emotional states. A \"component patterning\" model of vocal affect expression is proposed that attempts to rink the outcomes of antecedent event evaluation to biologically based response patterns. On the basis of a literature survey of acoustic-phonetic evidence, the likely phonatory and articulatory correlates of the physiological responses characterizing different emotional states are described in the form of three major voice types (narrow-wide, lax-tense, full-thin). Specific predictions are made as to the changes in acoustic parameters resulting from changing voice types. These predictions are compared with the pattern of empirical findings yielded by a comprehensive survey of the literature on vocal cues in emotional expression. Although the comparison is largely limited to the tense-lax voice type (because acoustic parameters relevant to the other voice types have not yet been systematically studied), a high degree of convergence is revealed. It is suggested that the model may help to stimulate hypothesis-guided research as well as provide a framework for the development of appropriate research paradigms.",

Canadian and Mexican female teachers, speaking whatever words they wished in their own languages, attempted to simulate four emotional states (i.e., happiness, sadness, love, and anger). After the initial recording, these samples were passed through an electronic filter which removed the semantic content while leaving intact the tonal qualities of the speech. The filtered vocal expressions were played to Canadian and Mexican subjects 5, 9, 13, 17, 25,45, and 65 years of age. From 5 through 25, there was a progressive increase with age in ability to identify the emotion expressed. Ability did level off, however, and eventually even decreased (such that the 65 year-olds performed less accurately than the other adult groups). Overall, the Mexican subjects were significantly more sensitive to emotion in speech than their Canadian counterparts. As well, both C...",

These questions were studied for 7 emotions in 37 countries. Results show rather high convergence across geopolitical regions with respect to emotion specific profiles, suggesting universality of the appraisal mechanism. Empirical profiles corresponded in large measure to theoretical predictions. There were sizable differences between geopolitical regions with respect to general appraisal tendencies. Respondents in Africa tended to appraise events as more immoral, more unfair or unjust, and more externally caused. Respondents in Latin America tended to appraise emotion-antecedent events as less immoral than those in other regions. To find potential explanatory factors, a number of key country variables related to climate, cultural values, and socioeconomic-demographic factors were examined.",

FACS is used to objectively measure the frequency and intensity of facial expressions without assigning any emotional meaning to those muscle movements. Instead FACS breaks down facial expressions into their smallest discriminable movements called Action Units. Each Action Unit creates a distinct change in facial appearance, such as an eyebrow lift or nose wrinkle. FACS coders can identify the Action Units which are present on the face when viewing still images or videos. Psychological research has used FACS to examine a variety of research questions including social-emotional development, neuropsychiatric disorders, and deception. In the course of this report we provide an overview of FACS and the Action Units, its reliability as a measure, and how it has been applied in some key areas of psychological research.",

This model is based on the state of the art concept of artificial neural networks (ANN) which we improve by adding ‘artificial emotions’. The way of the implementation of emotions is based on the research results regarding the biological and biochemical processes modulating neural cells in animals and humans. The described modulation takes place not only on the level of synapses, but also on the level of calculations happening on the membrane of the cell, or the node of the ANN, respectively. The suggested model also includes the biological fact, that neuro modulatory glands (e.g., hypophysis) are mainly controlled by the neuronal system itself. The resulting proposed system is named EMotional Artificial Neural Network (EMANN). It shows that EMANN has different abilities, compared to ANNs without emotions.",

The concept of designing the value set is based on Laban Movement Analysis which is a famous theory in body movement psychology. Impressions produced by body expression are closely related to these feature values. Each of the feature values is defined mathematically, so that it is easy to implement in a computer. Also the feature values are calculated on general body movements. Therefore, the set can be implemented in body expression systems of robots and computer graphics bodies in order to facilitate quantitative evaluation and forecast of impression produced by their bodies. This paper describes the concept and an example of implementation on a robot. Validity of the set is verified in an experiment.",

Freire was the first director of the University of Recife's Cultural Extension Service that provided literacy programs to thousands of peasants. Freire and his coworkers taught the peasants not only skills for reading and writing, but they also introduced participation in the political process through knowledge of reading and writing as a desirable and attainable goal for all Brazilians. He inspired the poor to hope that they could have a voice in making life decisions. The Brazilian military and landowners were threatened by the peasant's desire for reform and to have their voices heard; they considered Freire's teaching to be radical. Freire was jailed, then sent into exile for his so-called \"subversive\" activities.",

By examining the way in which the bodies of Vietnamese immigrants are simultaneously object and agent, I will indicate how the relations between migrants and the wider society are felt and sensed through the bodily experiences of Vietnamese people. The dynamic between how Vietnamese bodies are represented and how they are experienced reveals the body to be a predominant marker of difference from both within and without, the mediator between experience and signification. I will indicate how the dominant media construction of Vietnamese bodies as defiled has sustained forms of exclusion and distancing which have influenced the way that Vietnamese bodies are lived. I thus explore the means through which the body has particular salience when attempting to understand the nature of migrant identities in Australia.",

Worrying was further characterized by higher skin conductance levels compared with baseline but lower levels than during anticipation.

All patients completed self-report inventories measuring CR-SE and social anxiety symptoms at baseline and post-I-CBT/post-WL, and I-CBT completers were also assessed at 1-year posttreatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with WL, I-CBT resulted in greater increases in CR-SE and greater decreases in social anxiety. Increases in CR-SE during I-CBT mediated the effect of I-CBT on social anxiety. Gains achieved by patients receiving I-CBT were maintained 1-year posttreatment, and I-CBT-related increases in CR-SE were also associated with reduction in social anxiety at the 1-year follow-up.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIncreasing CR-SE may be an important mechanism by which I-CBT for SAD produces both immediate and long-term reductions in social anxiety.",

To test this distinction, 120 participants were shown a disgusting film while their experiential, behavioral, and physiological responses were recorded. Participants were told to either (a) think about the film in such a way that they would feel nothing (reappraisal, a form of antecedent-focused emotion regulation), (b) behave in such a way that someone watching them would not know they were feeling anything (suppression, a form of response-focused emotion regulation), or (c) watch the film (a control condition). Compared with the control condition, both reappraisal and suppression were effective in reducing emotion-expressive behavior. However, reappraisal decreased disgust experience, whereas suppression increased sympathetic activation. These results suggest that these 2 emotion regulatory processes may have different adaptive consequences.",

            "abstract": "Although depressed mood is a normal occurrence in response to adversity in all individuals, what distinguishes those who are vulnerable to major depressive disorder (MDD) is their inability to effectively regulate negative mood when it arises. Investigating the neural underpinnings of adaptive emotion regulation and the extent to which such processes are compromised in MDD may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of depression. We report results from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrating left-lateralized activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when downregulating negative affect in nondepressed individuals, whereas depressed individuals showed bilateral PFC activation. Furthermore, during an effortful affective reappraisal task, nondepressed individuals showed an inverse relationship between activation in left ventrolateral PFC and the amygdala that is mediated by the ventromedial PFC (VMPFC). No such relationship was found for depressed individuals, who instead show a positive association between VMPFC and amygdala. Pupil dilation data suggest that those depressed patients who expend more effort to reappraise negative stimuli are characterized by accentuated activation in the amygdala, insula, and thalamus, whereas nondepressed individuals exhibit the opposite pattern. These findings indicate that a key feature underlying the pathophysiology of major depression is the counterproductive engagement of right prefrontal cortex and the lack of engagement of left lateral-ventromedial prefrontal circuitry important for the downregulation of amygdala responses to negative stimuli.",

Specifically, a clear correspondence does not emerge between clusters of complex clinical symptoms and dysregulated neurobiological systems, with many apparent redundancies. For instance, many mental disorders involve multiple disruptions in putative mechanistic factors (e.g., excessive fear, deficient impulse control), and different disrupted mechanisms appear to play major roles in many disorders. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework is a heuristic to facilitate the incorporation of behavioral neuroscience in the study of psychopathology. Such integration might be achieved by shifting the central research focus of the field away from clinical description to more squarely examine aberrant mechanisms. RDoC first aims to identify reliable and valid psychological and biological mechanisms and their disruptions, with an eventual goal of understanding how anomalies in these mechanisms drive psychiatric symptoms. This approach will require new methods to ascertain samples, relying on hypothesized psychopathological mechanisms to define experimental groups instead of traditional diagnostic categories. RDoC, by design, uncouples research efforts from clinically familiar categories to focus directly on fundamental mechanisms of psychopathology. RDoC proposes a matrix of domains and levels of analyses and invites the field to test and refine the framework. If RDoC is successful, the domains will ultimately relate to familiar psychopathologies in ways that promote new knowledge regarding etiology and more efficient development of new preventive and treatment interventions.",

Do the negative outcomes of rumination result from how people think about negative events or simply that they think about them at all? To address this question, participants in 2 studies recalled a recent anger-provoking event and then thought about it in 1 of 2 ways: by ruminating or by reappraising. The authors examined the impact of these strategies on subsequent ratings of anger experience (Study 1) as well as on perseverative thinking and physiological responding over time (Study 2). Relative to reappraisal, rumination led to greater anger experience, more cognitive perseveration, and greater sympathetic nervous system activation. These findings provide compelling new evidence that how one thinks about an emotional event can shape the emotional response one has.",

            "abstract": "The migration of large numbers of blacks from southern rural to northern urban centers in the 1920s led to dramatic changes in the social andeconomic structure of industrialized cities such as Buffalo, New York. As a result of the “Great Migration” to Buffalo, the black population rose from 4,511 in 1920 to 13,563 in 1930. These figures contrasted strikingly with a black population of 1,698 in 1900 and 1,773 in 1910. Over this thirty-year period., the black population had increased from .48 percent to 2.40 percent of the city’s total population. A number of factors contributed to the migration of blacks from the South into Buffalo and other northern, industrial centers. These included (1) the entry of the United States into the First World War in 1917: (2) the drain on the industrial white labor force due to military conscription and the return of significant numbers of immigrants to Europe to join the war effort; (3) a shortage of new white labor due to restrictive immigration policies stemming from a national xenophobia and a fear of anarchists; and (4) a growing demand for unskilled and semi-skilled, nonunionized workers as a response to the militarization of unions. Coupled with the magnetic pull of these economic inducements in the North was the push of farm tenancy and peonage, civil disfranchisement, and the constant fear of violence against blacks in the South. With this continuing influx of blacks, the city’s composition became more racially heterogeneous. Moreover, there was now a black underclass of southern migrants who would, in some instances, be exploited and dis-",

It takes shape as a dialogue in which teachers and students mutually investigate everyday themes, social issues, and academic knowledge. Through dialogue and problem-posing, students become active agents of their learning. This book shows how students can develop as critical thinkers, inspired learners, skilled workers, and involved citizens. Shor carefully analyzes obstacles to and resources for empowering education, suggesting ways for teachers to transform traditional approaches into critical and democratic ones.

            "title": "Find out What It Means to Me Respect. (the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning)",
            "abstract": "Abstract Drawing on the perspectives of middle and high school youth, this article highlights the multiple meanings of respect within the context of the central classroom experience -- interactions between teachers and students. In conversation and in writing, students define respect as relational, they qualify respectful relationships as reciprocal, and they argue for a radial compass in teacher/student relationships. The discussion of respect is framed by a reference to Aretha Franklin's popular musical hit and thus situated within the larger socio-cultural context where the meanings of words, and interpersonal interactions, are continually and necessarily defined and redefined. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for teachers and teacher educators of the importance of examining and re-examining the concept of respect. ********** \"Relate to me, debate with me, respect me. Stop neglecting me\" (Strucker et al., in press). So writes Lenelle Moise, a Haitian American high school senior, in an appeal to teachers at her urban public school. Emily Gann, a white high school senior, argues that, compared to traditional approaches to teaching math, an alternative program piloted in her urban magnet school is \"far more capable of engaging students' interest and respecting their ability to learn by discovery\" (Holt et al., in press). Discussing why better communication among teachers and students at his urban public high school might make students less likely to cut class, Maurice Baxter, an African American senior, explains: \"You can't have good communication without respect. If I don't respect you, we can't communicate\" (Sanon et al., in press). Today's youth want what Aretha Franklin demanded in her popular 1960s song: \"R-E-S-P-E-C-T, Find out what it means to me.\" But respect is multi-faceted, and its meaning shifts across time, settings, and relationships. As teachers working within larger socio-cultural contexts as well as within our individual classrooms, we must recognize students' desire for respect, and we must both respond to and problematize it through listening to students' perspectives, sharing our own, and finding a common ground between them. To create educational environments that support the best teaching and learning, we must work together with students to find out what respect means to every \"me\" in our classrooms. The Many Facets of Respect The diverse students with whom I have worked have addressed the issue of respect explicitly and implicitly. In the following discussion I draw on audiotaped conversations among high school students and exchanges of letters between high school students and pre-service teachers (Cook-Sather, 2001) and on chapters from an edited volume (Shultz and Cook-Sather, in press). For those students quoted in conversations and letters I include first names only to preserve confidentiality. For those students quoted from the book chapters, I use full names. Although the definitions of respect that students offer are various and complex, students' comments fall into three interrelated categories. Within the context of the central classroom experience -- interactions between teachers and students -- these students define respect as relational, they qualify respectful relationships as reciprocal, and they argue for a radial compass in teacher/student relationships. Respect as Relational Respect is not simply a way of being but rather a way of being in relationship. The words that opened this essay issue from a longer journal entry: Reach me with more than words from textbooks -- but words from the soul and the mind connected to the heart. What got you to teach me? Wasn't it to reach me? ... Relate to me, debate with me, respect me. Stop neglecting me. I get nothing but tired empty wordswordswords ... make them real. (Strucker et al., in press) As Lenelle explains, there can be no respect -- or relationship -- in empty words. …",

The construct of narrative is preferred, because it allows teachers to examine all personal writing as a representation and not the same thing as the writer's life. Strategies are developed for examining how experience is portrayed and how it might be written differently, with material effects on both the personal text and the writer's person. The book incorporates the latest theories of critical and genre literacy as it develops four teaching cases in different education contexts (secondary, undergraduate, graduate, and adult/community).",

With discussions of topics including the struggle over academic canon, the role of popular culture in the curriculum and the cultural war the New Right has waged on schools, Giroux identified the most pressing issues facing critical educators at the turn of the century. In this revised edition, Giroux reflects on the limits and possibilities of border crossings in the 21st century. \"Borders\" in our post 9/11 world have not been collapsing, he argues, but vigorously rebuilt. In order to have a truly critically engaged citizenry the challenges of these new \"borders\"- such as the increased militarization of public spaces, the rise of neo-liberalism, and the war in Iraq- must play a vital role in any debate on school and pedagogy.",

The book offers critical theory side by side with actual reports of teaching practice, so that philosophy is brought down to earth in terms familiar to practicing teachers.

The term “listening” surfaces in various ways, signaling different kinds and extents of student participation, ownership, and agency. For instance, Holdsworth’s (2000) “student participation ladder” moves from “youth/student voice: speaking out” to “being heard” to “being listened to” to “being listened to seriously and with respect” to “incorporating youth/student views into actions taken by others” to “sharing decision-making, implementation of action, and reflection on action with young people” (p.",

In this case, listening is in the middle of the “ladder,” beyond simply speaking out and being heard but not as high as taking action and shared decision making. Mitra’s (in press) discussion of types of student voice work in school reform uses “listening” to refer to a process through which “adults listen to student perspectives as a form of raw knowledge for either research or reform”; she uses “collaboration” to signal a “focus on research” within which “students and adults work together to conduct research and/or to develop changes”; and she uses “leadership” to signal a “focus on change” within which “youth are in charge of the activity and make most of the decisions. Adults provide assistance.” In this case, listening is the most basic form of attention to student voice with “collaboration” and “leadership” signaling increasingly greater roles and agency for students. Lodge (2005) makes explicit some underlying principles that inform both typologies mentioned above, suggesting that approaches to student voice can be analyzed along two dimensions: the role of the student and the purposes for which participation is being sought."

An equally demeaning form of attention to student voices is seeing them as decorations. As Fine, Torre, Burns, and Payne (in press) explain, their e-mail inboxes are “a virtual catalogue of invitations [from researchers, publishers, and policymakers] to ‘gather student voices’ as if they were Christmas tree decorations on an already pre-determined reform ‘for their own good.’ ” Furthermore, there is the danger of even well-intentioned student voice initiatives: Some efforts to “increase student voice and participation can actually reinforce a hierarchy of power and privilege among students and undermine attempted reforms” (Silva, 2001, p. 98). Orner (1992) cautions against this tendency in general, warning that calls for student voice as a central component of student empowerment perpetuate “relations of domination in the name of liberation” (p.",

The first, Deconstructing the presumptions of the present, explores the largely ignored problematic of much student voice work. (1) 'Problems of speaking about others', (2) 'Problems of speaking for others', and problems of (3) 'Getting heard' reveal a range of issues that need to be better understood and acknowledged. The second, On the necessity of dialogue, attempts a resolution, exploring the possibility of (4) 'Speaking about/for others in supportive ways' before offering the preferred (5) 'Dialogic alternative: speaking with rather than for' and further developing that line of enquiry through (6) 'Students as co/researchers'.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT English speakers use vertical language to talk about power, such as when speaking of people being “at the bottom of the social hierarchy” or “rising to the top.” Experimental research has shown that people automatically associate higher spatial positions with more powerful social groups, such as doctors and army generals, compared to lower spatial positions, which are associated with relatively less powerful groups, such as nurses and soldiers. However, power as a social dimension is also associated with gender. Here, by means of a reaction-time study and a corpus study, we show that professions that display greater gender asymmetries, such as doctor/nurse, exhibit stronger vertical associations. Moreover, we show that people’s perception of vertical metaphors for power depends on their own gender, with male participants having stronger vertical biases than female participants, which we propose is due to the fact that men are more prone to thinking about power in bodily terms, and to associate it with physical dominance. Our results provide clear evidence for individual differences in metaphor comprehension, thus demonstrating empirically that the same metaphor is understood differently by different people.",

Materials and methods This study examined the influence of gender stereotypes on the choice of career in adolescents. A group of 120 students were recruited to complete an ad hoc questionnaire, Scale of Perceived Occupational Self-Efficacy, and Semantic Differentials. The objectives of the study were to analyze the relationship between occupational self-efficacy and professional preference; to measure the influence of independent variables, such as age and gender, on the representation that students have of themselves and of the profession; and to identify the predictor variables of self-efficacy in the vocational decision. Results Data showed that the distance between professional identity and social identity increases with age. Results underline that males seem to perceive themselves more self-efficient in military, scientific–technological, and agrarian professions than females. Furthermore, the type of job performed by parents appears to be a self-efficacy predictor variable in the choice of professions in the services area. Conclusion Individuals’ perceived occupational self-efficacy, gender, age, and parents’ profession have implications for exploratory behavior. The conditions that make gender differences salient are more likely to favor self-representations of the career and consistent assessments with these representations.",

            "abstract": "By use of a dual-task paradigm, 3 studies investigated the contention that stereotypes function as resource-preserving devices in mental life. In Study 1, Ss formed impressions of targets while simultaneously monitoring a prose passage. The results demonstrated a significant enhancement in Ss' prose-monitoring performance when stereotype labels were present on the impression-formation task. To investigate the intentionality of this effect, in Study 2, the procedures used in Study 1 were repeated using a subliminal priming procedure to activate stereotypes. Subliminal activation of stereotypes produced the same resource-preserving effects as supraliminal activation did. This effect, moreover, was replicated in Study 3 when a probe reaction task was used to measure resource preservation. These findings, which generalized across a range of social stereotypes, are discussed in terms of their implications for contemporary models of stereotyping and social inference. Human adaptation to the challenging and complex environment has often taken the form of developing tools that facilitate the execution of mundane but necessary tasks, leaving more time and energy available for other, perhaps more interesting or rewarding activities. It is reasonable to suppose, as some contemporary psychologists have, that the development of physical tools, such as plows or printing presses, has been paralleled by the development of cognitive \"tools,\" or routine strategies of inference and evaluation (cf. Tooby & Cosmides, 1990) that permit a sufficiently effective analysis of the social environment to be accomplished in an efficient fashion. The benefit of such mental tools presumably lies in the fact that they free up limited cognitive resources for the performance of other necessary or desirable mental activities. Social psychologists have frequently characterized stereotypes as energy-saving devices that serve the important cognitive function of simplifying information processing and response generation (e.g., Allport, 1954; Andersen, Klatzky, & Murray, 1990; Bodenhausen & Lichtenstein, 1987; Brewer, 1988; Fiske & Neuberg, 1990; Tajfel, 1969). Building on this tradition, Gilbert and Hixon (1991) aptly characterized stereotypes as \"tools that jump out\" of a metaphorical cognitive toolbox \"when there is a job to be done\" (p. 510). Anyone who has ever succumbed to the temptation to evaluate others in terms of their social group membership would doubtlessly recognize the power of this contention. Individuation, in its many guises, is a rather",

We cast the task as a reinforcement learning problem where we jointly train two systems: a generative model to produce response sequences, and a discriminator—analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test— to distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. In this generative adversarial network approach, the outputs from the discriminator are used to encourage the system towards more human-like dialogue. Further, we investigate models for adversarial evaluation that uses success in fooling an adversary as a dialogue evaluation metric, while avoiding a number of potential pitfalls. Experimental results on several metrics, including adversarial evaluation, demonstrate that the adversarially-trained system generates higher-quality responses than previous baselines",

In this paper, we explore an important step toward this generation task: training an LSTM (Longshort term memory) auto-encoder to preserve and reconstruct multi-sentence paragraphs. We introduce an LSTM model that hierarchically builds an embedding for a paragraph from embeddings for sentences and words, then decodes this embedding to reconstruct the original paragraph. We evaluate the reconstructed paragraph using standard metrics like ROUGE and Entity Grid, showing that neural models are able to encode texts in a way that preserve syntactic, semantic, and discourse coherence. While only a first step toward generating coherent text units from neural models, our work has the potential to significantly impact natural language generation and summarization1.",

The network handles input sentences of varying length and induces a feature graph over the sentence that is capable of explicitly capturing short and long-range relations. The network does not rely on a parse tree and is easily applicable to any language. We test the DCNN in four experiments: small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way question classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant supervision. The network achieves excellent performance in the first three tasks and a greater than 25% error reduction in the last task with respect to the strongest baseline.",

When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, \"powerful,\" \"strong\" and \"Paris\" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.",

The Deep Generative Deconvolutional Network (DGDN) is used as a decoder of the latent image features, and a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as an image encoder; the CNN is used to approximate a distribution for the latent DGDN features/code. The latent code is also linked to generative models for labels (Bayesian support vector machine) or captions (recurrent neural network). When predicting a label/caption for a new image at test, averaging is performed across the distribution of latent codes; this is computationally efficient as a consequence of the learned CNN-based encoder. Since the framework is capable of modeling the image in the presence/absence of associated labels/captions, a new semi-supervised setting is manifested for CNN learning with images; the framework even allows unsupervised CNN learning, based on images alone.",

We introduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks. Compared to recurrent models, computations over all elements can be fully parallelized during training and optimization is easier since the number of non-linearities is fixed and independent of the input length. Our use of gated linear units eases gradient propagation and we equip each decoder layer with a separate attention module. We outperform the accuracy of the deep LSTM setup of Wu et al.

The ByteNet is a one-dimensional convolutional neural network that is composed of two parts, one to encode the source sequence and the other to decode the target sequence. The two network parts are connected by stacking the decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address the differing lengths of the source and the target, we introduce an efficient mechanism by which the decoder is dynamically unfolded over the representation of the encoder. The ByteNet uses dilation in the convolutional layers to increase its receptive field. The resulting network has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and it sidesteps the need for excessive memorization. The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent networks. The ByteNet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on character-to-character machine translation on the English-to-German WMT translation task, surpassing comparable neural translation models that are based on recurrent networks with attentional pooling and run in quadratic time. We find that the latent alignment structure contained in the representations reflects the expected alignment between the tokens.",

Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a \\textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an \\textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.",

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.",

We view it as a special case of a general framework which jointly trains a linear model with a non-linear feature generator consisting of `text region embedding + pooling'. Under this framework, we explore a more sophisticated region embedding method using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM can embed text regions of variable (and possibly large) sizes, whereas the region size needs to be fixed in a CNN. We seek effective and efficient use of LSTM for this purpose in the supervised and semi-supervised settings. The best results were obtained by combining region embeddings in the form of LSTM and convolution layers trained on unlabeled data. The results indicate that on this task, embeddings of text regions, which can convey complex concepts, are more useful than embeddings of single words in isolation. We report performances exceeding the previous best results on four benchmark datasets.",

Our model requires very few expensive autoregressive layers compared to PixelCNN and learns latent codes that are more compressed than a standard VAE while still capturing most non-trivial structure. Finally, we extend our model to a hierarchy of latent variables at different scales.

This paper studies CNN on text categorization to exploit the 1D structure (namely, word order) of text data for accurate prediction. Instead of using low-dimensional word vectors as input as is often done, we directly apply CNN to high-dimensional text data, which leads to directly learning embedding of small text regions for use in classification. In addition to a straightforward adaptation of CNN from image to text, a simple but new variation which employs bag-of-word conversion in the convolution layer is proposed. An extension to combine multiple convolution layers is also explored for higher accuracy. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.",

While these extract precise hidden patterns in motion data, they are often task-specific and lack a semantic understatement of motion. Symbolic systems that mirror human cognition and explicit expressive processes are necessary for richer motion synthesis and analysis, enabling physical reasoning and expert knowledge encoding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that combines Labanotation and Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), originally developed for dance, to represent and analyze human motion symbolically. We expand the existing LabanEditor to support full-body annotation and integrate it with AMASS, Mediapipe, and Kinect inputs through a SMPL-based format. Our system supports automatic annotation for the local functional and expressive aspects of motion, and enables bidirectional conversion between symbols and motion. While still a work in progress, this framework lays the groundwork for explainable, expressive motion modeling that can support human-robot interaction, motion preservation, and psychomotor learning systems.",

            "abstract": "Large datasets are the cornerstone of recent advances in computer vision using deep learning. In contrast, existing human motion capture (mocap) datasets are small and the motions limited, hampering progress on learning models of human motion. While there are many different datasets available, they each use a different parameterization of the body, making it difficult to integrate them into a single meta dataset. To address this, we introduce AMASS, a large and varied database of human motion that unifies 15 different optical marker-based mocap datasets by representing them within a common framework and parameterization. We achieve this using a new method, MoSh++, that converts mocap data into realistic 3D human meshes represented by a rigged body model. Here we use SMPL [Loper et al., 2015], which is widely used and provides a standard skeletal representation as well as a fully rigged surface mesh. The method works for arbitrary marker sets, while recovering soft-tissue dynamics and realistic hand motion. We evaluate MoSh++ and tune its hyperparameters using a new dataset of 4D body scans that are jointly recorded with markerbased mocap. The consistent representation of AMASS makes it readily useful for animation, visualization, and generating training data for deep learning. Our dataset is significantly richer than previous human motion collections, having more than 40 hours of motion data, spanning over 300 subjects, more than 11000 motions, and will be publicly available to the research community.",

This book makes it possible to record accurately, for study and reconstruction, the great dance creations of the theater, as well as such diverse activities as time/motion studies for industry, personnel assessment and physical therapy. So comprehensive that it can indicate even facial expressions, the system is also simple enough for a child to learn easily as an integral part of athletic or dance training.",

Additionally, we explore the potential for utilising this data-driven methodology to aid novice practitioners in enhancing their performance. The findings showcase the efficacy of this approach in accurately identifying proficiency levels and lay the groundwork for personalised interventions to support skill refinement and mastery. This research contributes to the field of motor skill assessment and intervention strategies, with broad implications for sports training, physical rehabilitation, and performance optimisation across various domains.\n",

The system can recognise predefined movement qualities through gesture analysis. It also allows for the control of abstract visuals based on physical models, specifically mass-springs models, displaying graphical animations with ‘qualities’ reflecting the participants’ expressions. \n \nThis work has been implemented and tested in an interactive installation called ‘Double Skin/Double Mind’. In that context, we were able to test the contribution of our system to dance pedagogy and to collect participants’ feedback. These preliminary tests suggest that the dancers can embrace the interaction with physical model-based visuals. They also reveal that the movement qualities of the visuals generated by our system fairly mirror the dancers’ own qualities.",

            "abstract": "The past decade has seen an extraordinarily intense period of experimentation with computer technology within the performing arts. Digital media has been increasingly incorporated into live theater and dance, and new forms of interactive performance have emerged in participatory installations, on CD-ROM, and on the Web. In Digital Performance, Steve Dixon traces the evolution of these practices, presents detailed accounts of key practitioners and performances, and analyzes the theoretical, artistic, and technological contexts of this form of new media art. Dixon finds precursors to today's digital performances in past forms of theatrical technology that range from the deus ex machina of classical Greek drama to Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk (concept of the total artwork), and draws parallels between contemporary work and the theories and practices of Constructivism, Dada, Surrealism, Expressionism, Futurism, and multimedia pioneers of the twentieth century. For a theoretical perspective on digital performance, Dixon draws on the work of Philip Auslander, Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Jean Baudrillard, and others. To document and analyze contemporary digital performance practice, Dixon considers changes in the representation of the body, space, and time. He considers virtual bodies, avatars, and digital doubles, as well as performances by artists including Stelarc, Robert Lepage, Merce Cunningham, Laurie Anderson, Blast Theory, and Eduardo Kac. He investigates new media's novel approaches to creating theatrical spectacle, including virtual reality and robot performance work, telematic performances in which remote locations are linked in real time, Webcams, and online drama communities, and considers the \"extratemporal\" illusion created by some technological theater works. Finally, he defines categories of interactivity, from navigational to participatory and collaborative. Dixon challenges dominant theoretical approaches to digital performance -- including what he calls postmodernism's denial of the new -- and offers a series of boldly original arguments in their place.",

        "abstract": "Large datasets are the cornerstone of recent advances in computer vision using deep learning. In contrast, existing human motion capture (mocap) datasets are small and the motions limited, hampering progress on learning models of human motion. While there are many different datasets available, they each use a different parameterization of the body, making it difficult to integrate them into a single meta dataset. To address this, we introduce AMASS, a large and varied database of human motion that unifies 15 different optical marker-based mocap datasets by representing them within a common framework and parameterization. We achieve this using a new method, MoSh++, that converts mocap data into realistic 3D human meshes represented by a rigged body model. Here we use SMPL [Loper et al., 2015], which is widely used and provides a standard skeletal representation as well as a fully rigged surface mesh. The method works for arbitrary marker sets, while recovering soft-tissue dynamics and realistic hand motion. We evaluate MoSh++ and tune its hyperparameters using a new dataset of 4D body scans that are jointly recorded with markerbased mocap. The consistent representation of AMASS makes it readily useful for animation, visualization, and generating training data for deep learning. Our dataset is significantly richer than previous human motion collections, having more than 40 hours of motion data, spanning over 300 subjects, more than 11000 motions, and will be publicly available to the research community.",

Recent advances in 2D human pose estimation use large amounts of manually-labeled training data for learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Such data is time consuming to acquire and difficult to extend. Moreover, manual labeling of 3D pose, depth and motion is impractical. In this work we present SURREAL (Synthetic hUmans foR REAL tasks): a new large-scale dataset with synthetically-generated but realistic images of people rendered from 3D sequences of human motion capture data. We generate more than 6 million frames together with ground truth pose, depth maps, and segmentation masks. We show that CNNs trained on our synthetic dataset allow for accurate human depth estimation and human part segmentation in real RGB images. Our results and the new dataset open up new possibilities for advancing person analysis using cheap and large-scale synthetic data.",

A 3-D convolutional \nneural network is used to learn a pose embedding from volumetric probabilistic \nvisual hull data (PVH) derived from the MVV frames. We incorporate this model within \na dual stream network integrating pose embeddings derived from MVV and a forward \nkinematic solve of the IMU data. A temporal model (LSTM) is incorporated within \nboth streams prior to their fusion. Hybrid pose inference using these two complementary \ndata sources is shown to resolve ambiguities within each sensor modality, yielding improved \naccuracy over prior methods. A further contribution of this work is a new hybrid \nMVV dataset (TotalCapture) comprising video, IMU and a skeletal joint ground truth \nderived from a commercial motion capture system.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMedication is the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses, but many people continue to experience symptoms in spite of medication (Johnstone 1998). In addition to medication, creative therapies, such as drama therapy may prove beneficial. Drama therapy is a form of treatment that encourages spontaneity and creativity. It can promote emotional expression, but does not necessarily require the participant to have insight into their condition or psychological-mindset.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo review the effects of drama therapy and related approaches as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia compared with standard care and other psychosocial interventions.\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (October 2006), hand searched reference lists, hand searched Dramatherapy (the journal of the British Association of Dramatherapists) and Arts in Psychotherapy and contacted relevant authors.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included all randomised controlled trials that compared drama therapy, psychodrama and related approaches with standard care or other psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data from the studies. We excluded data where more than 50% of participants in any group were lost to follow up. For continuous outcomes we calculated a weighted mean difference and its 95% confidence interval. For binary outcomes we calculated a fixed effects risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI) and a number needed to treat (NNT).\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nThe search identified 183 references but only five studies (total n=210) met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies were on inpatient populations and compared the intervention with standard inpatient care. One study had drama therapy as the intervention, one had role-playing, one had a social drama group and two used psychodrama. Two of the included studies were Chinese and it is difficult to know whether psychodrama and indeed inpatient psychiatric care in China is comparable with the drama interventions and inpatient care in the other included studies. There were no significant findings about the value of drama interventions for keeping inpatients engaged in treatment. Due to poor reporting very little data from the five studies could be used and there were no conclusive findings about the harms or benefits of drama therapy for inpatients with schizophrenia.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nRandomised studies are possible in this field. The use of drama therapy for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses should continue to be under evaluation as its benefits, or harms, are unclear.",

We focus on two commonly used emotion regulation strategies: reappraisal (changing the way one thinks about a potentially emotion-eliciting event) and suppression (changing the way one responds behaviorally to an emotion-eliciting event). In the first section, we review experimental findings showing that reappraisal has a healthier profile of short-term affective, cognitive, and social consequences than suppression. In the second section, we review individual-difference findings, which show that using reappraisal to regulate emotions is associated with healthier patterns of affect, social functioning, and well-being than is using suppression. In the third section, we consider issues in the development of reappraisal and suppression and provide new evidence for a normative shift toward an increasingly healthy emotion regulation profile during adulthood (i.e., increases in the use of reappraisal and decreases in the use of suppression).",

Next, we consider what happens when emotion becomes dysregulated in a major depressive episode. We suggest that an emotion regulatory perspective integrates diverse theoretical views of depression and has implications for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of depression. We conclude by speculating about the role of emotion regulation in the broader context of public mental health.",

The most fundamental issue is how to learn an effective and accurate representation from spatiotemporal action sequences towards improved performance, and this article aims to address the aforementioned challenge. In particular, we design a novel method of hybrid features' extraction based on the construction of multistream networks and their organic fusion. First, we train a convolution neural networks (CNN) model to learn CNN‐based features with the raw skeleton coordinates and their temporal differences serving as input signals. The attention mechanism is injected into the CNN model to weigh more effective and important information. Then, we employ long short‐term memory (LSTM) to obtain long‐term temporal features from action sequences. Finally, we generate the hybrid features by fusing the CNN and LSTM networks, and we classify action types with the hybrid features. The extensive experiments are performed on several large‐scale publically available databases, and promising results demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

This formulation not only leads to greater expressive power but also stronger generalization capability.

Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art results, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Frechet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Visualization of the attention layers shows that the generator leverages neighborhoods that correspond to object shapes rather than local regions of fixed shape.",

Our key idea is to combine recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and adversarial training for human motion modeling. We first describe an efficient method for training an RNN model from prerecorded motion data. We implement RNNs with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells because they are capable of addressing the nonlinear dynamics and long term temporal dependencies present in human motions. Next, we train a refiner network using an adversarial loss, similar to generative adversarial networks (GANs), such that refined motion sequences are indistinguishable from real mocap data using a discriminative network. The resulting model is appealing for motion synthesis and control because it is compact, contact-aware, and can generate an infinite number of naturally looking motions with infinite lengths. Our experiments show that motions generated by our deep learning model are always highly realistic and comparable to high-quality motion capture data. We demonstrate the power and effectiveness of our models by exploring a variety of applications, ranging from random motion synthesis, online/offline motion control, and motion filtering. We show the superiority of our generative model by comparison against baseline models.",

            "abstract": "Data-driven modeling of human motions is ubiquitous in computer graphics and computer vision applications, such as synthesizing realistic motions or recognizing actions. Recent research has shown that such problems can be approached by learning a natural motion manifold using deep learning on a large amount data, to address the shortcomings of traditional data-driven approaches. However, previous deep learning methods can be sub-optimal for two reasons. First, the skeletal information has not been fully utilized for feature extraction. Unlike images, it is difficult to define spatial proximity in skeletal motions in the way that deep networks can be applied for feature extraction. Second, motion is time-series data with strong multi-modal temporal correlations between frames. On the one hand, a frame could be followed by several candidate frames leading to different motions; on the other hand, long-range dependencies exist where a number of frames in the beginning are correlated with a number of frames later. Ineffective temporal modeling would either under-estimate the multi-modality and variance, resulting in featureless mean motion or over-estimate them resulting in jittery motions, which is a major source of visual artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new deep network to tackle these challenges by creating a natural motion manifold that is versatile for many applications. The network has a new spatial component for feature extraction. It is also equipped with a new batch prediction model that predicts a large number of frames at once, such that long-term temporally-based objective functions can be employed to correctly learn the motion multi-modality and variances. With our system, long-duration motions can be predicted/synthesized using an open-loop setup where the motion retains the dynamics accurately. It can also be used for denoising corrupted motions and synthesizing new motions with given control signals. We demonstrate that our system can create superior results comparing to existing work in multiple applications.",

Belongingness appears to have multiple and strong effects on emotional patterns and on cognitive processes. Lack of attachments is linked to a variety of ill effects on health, adjustment, and well-being. Other evidence, such as that concerning satiation, substitution, and behavioral consequences, is likewise consistent with the hypothesized motivation. Several seeming counterexamples turned out not to disconfirm the hypothesis. Existing evidence supports the hypothesis that the need to belong is a powerful, fundamental, and extremely pervasive motivation.",

            "abstract": "SUMMARY\nIn 1995 the American College of Sports Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published national guidelines on Physical Activity and Public Health. The Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorsed and supported these recommendations. The purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health. Development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists, including physicians, epidemiologists, exercise scientists, and public health specialists. This panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical scientific data, including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995. Issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health, physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim, and communications issues. Key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts. Comments were integrated into the final recommendation.\n\n\nPRIMARY RECOMMENDATION\nTo promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week. [I (A)] Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation. [IIa (B)] For example, a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity, which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk and noticeably accelerates the heart rate, can be accumulated toward the 30-min minimum by performing bouts each lasting 10 or more minutes. [I (B)] Vigorous-intensity activity is exemplified by jogging, and causes rapid breathing and a substantial increase in heart rate. In addition, every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance a minimum of two days each week. [IIa (A)] Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, persons who wish to further improve their personal fitness, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity.

Two contradictory motive items, Breaking Away From Daily Routines and Preparing for a Career, were considered as individual motive items. The most important factors were Self‐Expression, Achievement/Performing and the individual motive item Breaking Away From Daily Routines. There were significant differences in the ratings of all four motivational factors and the two motive items between dance groups. Three motivational factors, Social Contacts, Fitness and Achievement/Performing, were similar to those most often found in sport studies. The comparison of...",

        "abstract": "Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent \"High Throughput\" methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.",

The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difficult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pre-training guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.",

        "title": "Three-Dimensional Visualization of Movement Qualities in Contemporary Dance",
        "abstract": "Analyzing and documenting contemporary dance movement data has proven to be a very difficult task due to the vast existence of styles and aesthetics which are characteristic of each individual choreographer. Indeed, identifying movement qualities with the intention of co-relating them to specific meanings and choreographic intentions is practically impossible without taking an artist-driven approach. Moreover, equipping dancers with wearable technology in order to accurately track each of their movements is only applicable in controlled laboratory scenarios, therefore not being a viable approach to analyze large scale real-world rehearsals or performances. This paper describes a visualization system that exposes movement qualities for dance through rendering effects. Combining optical flow analysis with depth video information, we were able to estimate the three-dimensional flow for each point in the cloud. This information was used to color point cloud videos with this information, showing potential to be used for the creation of different rendering effects, which are also discussed in this paper. The data used was captured in a non-intrusive manner during the creation process of a dance piece by Portuguese choreographer Rui Lopes Graça, enabling us to examine nuances and details of the rehearsals' process, which would not be replicable in a laboratory environment.",

The aim this study was to employ a method of video analysis to describe the physiological demands of classical ballet performance and to examine differences between artists, soloists, and principal dancers. Forty-eight performances [male = 24, female = 24; artists (corps de ballet) = 16, soloists =16, principals =16] were analyzed in four fields: work intensity, body movement, partner work, and number of transitory movements occurring per minute. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between ranks in two intensity bands: time at rest (p < 0.05) and time performing at moderate intensity (p < 0.05), with soloists and principals resting for 75.2 ± 15.1% and 53 ± 24.1% of the total performance, respectively (p < 0.05). Principals also spent a significantly greater percentage of time at moderate intensity than both soloists and artists (p < 0.05). Significant differences between males and females (p < 0.05) were seen in the number of lifting and supporting movements performed. It was concluded that classical ballet is an intermittent form of exercise, utilizing both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems, a finding that supports previous studies. The demands of the performances analyzed varied according to role. Therefore, it was also concluded that video analysis can help provide a basis for rank-specific supplemental training.",

In its typical use case scenario of representing a scanned environment, it has \nproven to be a less costly alternative than separate viewpoint encoding. However, higher quality laser scanner \nhardware and different user interaction paradigms have emerged, creating scenarios where traditional LDIs have \nconsiderably lower efficacy. Wide-baseline setups create surfaces aligned to the viewing rays producing a greater \namount of sparsely populated layers. Free viewpoint visualization suffers from the variant quantization of depths \non the LDI algorithm, reducing resolution of the dataset in uneven directions. This paper presents an alternative \nrepresentation to the LDI, in which each layer of data is positioned in different viewpoints that coincide with the \noriginal scanning viewpoints. A redundancy removal algorithm based on world-space distances as opposed to to \nimage-space is discussed, ensuring points are evenly distributed and are not viewpoint dependent. We compared \nour proposed representation with traditional LDIs and viewpoint dependent encoding. Results showed the multiview \nLDI (MVLDI) creates a smaller number of layers and removes higher amounts of redundancy than traditional \nLDIs, ensuring no relevant portion of data is discarded in wider baseline setups.",

In particular, we discuss the motion capture sessions that took place at Motek, Amsterdam as well as the dancers’ experience of being captured and watching themselves or others as varying visual representations through the HoloLens. HoloLens is Microsoft’s first holographic computer that you wear as you would a pair of glasses. The study embraced four dance genres: Ballet, Contemporary, Flamenco and Greek Folk dance. We are specifically interested in the kinesthetic and emotional engagement with the moving body and what new corporeal awareness may be experienced. Positioning the moving, dancing body as fundamental to technological advancements, we discuss the importance of considering the dancer’s experience in the real and virtual space. Some of the artists involved in the project have offered their experiences, which are included, and they form the basis of the discussion. In addition, we discuss the affect of immersive environments, how these environments expand reality and what effect (emotionally and otherwise) that has on the body. The research reveals insights into relationships between emotion, movement and technology and what new sensorial knowledge this evokes for the dancer.",

In digital technology contexts, movement quality information can be accessed and obtained by exploring the semantics of an expressive motion framework called Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) as well as the use of computational techniques to measure, analyze, and capture this type of information from the human body in motion. LMA has broad application across research fields of art computing (e.g., character animation, gesture recognition, interaction design, robotics, visual language, interactive arts, and game design). However, the integration of LMA within the visualization domain is still under exploration, and there are no contributions in that domain for representing high-level semantic information such as movement quality. This thesis’ research aims to develop understanding of how LMA can be used as a semantic design resource for visualizing movement qualities by (1) outlining potential visual mapping to represent movement qualities and (2) creating a set of design heuristics for abstract visual representation of movement quality. To generate better understanding of how LMA can be artistically applied to visualization contexts, practice-based research was used as an approach to developing a series of visualization systems that used LMA as an underlying model to capture, represent, and map movement quality to a visualization system. Movement experts were selected to participate in evaluation of the visualization systems, and the comparative analysis method was used to critique, analyze, and compare these visualization systems. This study contributes new knowledge gained from art practice by illustrating how movement theoretical models and movement expertise can be modified and adapted to the design and application of more richly articulated human movement knowledge within the visualization domain. Finally, the study provided a set of design heuristics comprised of eight design guidelines for representing eight movement qualities. These design guidelines can be applied and further explored in various areas, such as visual communication design, abstract animation, and movement analytics.",

Thereby, we hope to shed light on dance research in general and to outline possible directions for future studies. The notion of a contrastive opposition between the American anthropological perspective on dance and the European choreological one has unfortunately been based upon rather broad generalisations rooted in lack of mutually shared knowledge, partly caused by language barriers and in gaining access to relevant information. Generalisations have tended to gloss over the diversity of trends and directions which characterize the efforts on both sides of the Atlantic in establishing basic theories and developing the necessary methods and tools for dance research as a science of its own. There are, however, basic differences between the development of European and American dance research (see also Kaeppler, this volume). Thus, among European dance scholars, the general trend has been to study dance and dance events within their own culture, whereas American dance scholars have tended to concentrate their studies on cultures different from their own. American dance scholars have often come from the field of anthropology and, therefore, they have naturally applied already elaborated theories and methods to the study of dance processes. Their focus has been on \"dancing people\", therefore, they have seldom analyzed choreographic structure. Conversely, Eurpean dance scholars, who have come mainly from the field of musicology, have felt a different and explicit need to work towards the development of theories and methods deriving from the dance material itself as conceived in its pure choreographic features.",

Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight some recent technical developments. This Perspective describes the development and capabilities of SciPy 1.0, an open source scientific computing library for the Python programming language.",

        "abstract": "This work targets Dance Style Recognition in videos as an application of Human Action Recognition. We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Laban Feature descriptor (STLF) for dance style recognition based on Laban theory. Laban Movement Analysis has become increasingly popular as a language to describe, index and record human motion. We only exploit motion features and body-pose information without encoding the appearance. The model is tested on some action recognition benchmarks and ICD, a challenging dataset of YouTube dance videos. Unlike other works, where Laban based features have been used in constrained environments, with static camera, sensors and no background noise, we employ STLF on videos in unconstrained and natural settings. It is robust to camera jitter, zoom variations and other acquisition conditions and is computationally cheap. It performs comparable or better than the state-of-the-art.",

This paper conducts a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques, exploring different deep architectures and comparing them on a common ground, identifying and disclosing important implementation details. We identify several useful properties of CNN-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the CNN output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on performance. We also identify aspects of deep and shallow methods that can be successfully shared. In particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied to CNN-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous performance boost. Source code and models to reproduce the experiments in the paper is made publicly available.",

Recent studies showing that members of literate cultures associated the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors could not demonstrate that at least some facial expressions of emotion are universal; the cultures compared had all been exposed to some of the same mass media presentations of facial expression, and these may have taught the people in each culture to recognize the unique facial expressions of other cultures. To show that members of a preliterate culture who had minimal exposure to literate cultures would associate the same emotion concepts with the same facial behaviors as do members of Western and Eastern literate cultures, data were gathered in New Guinea by telling subjects a story, showing them a set of three faces, and asking them to select the face which showed the emotion appropriate to the story. The results provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that the association between particular facial muscular patterns and discrete emotions is universal.",

This research studied movement quality by using objective physical measurements of movement parameters and subjective movement quality judgments and by comparing both approaches in terms of reliability and validity. This is done on the basis of clinical behavior samples that compared movements of psychiatric patients before and after therapy (N = 20). Results indicate that subjective judgments of movement quality are used reliably by lay judges and that these judgments are related closely to objective movement parameters. Some characteristics of movement quality seem to be important cues in clinical judgments of patients' improvement, although, objectively, movements do not differ before and after successful therapy.",

We read that the Indian divorces his wife in the dance and, when he is ill, dances to dispel the disease; and that once in front of the Turkish soldiers sixty Greek mothers and girls danced the old Romaiika as they threw themselves one after another into the abyss. The book includes analyses of many forms of the art--sitting dances, dances of the hands, solo, group and couple dances--and a discussion of rhythm and melody in relation to the dance. But it is not only because of its informative character that the book is distinguished. World History of the Dance, written with rare force and insight, communicates a feeling for its subject such as is seldom found in works of historical research. It is the author's understanding of the essence of the art, its exhilaration and power to break down the distinctions of ordinary life, that makes his book so rich a contribution to the knowledge and appreciation of the dance.",

Three professional guitarists were asked to perform 3 short melodies to communicate anger, sadness, happiness, and fear to listeners. The resulting performances were analyzed with respect to 5 acoustic cues and judged by 30 listeners on adjective scales. Multiple regression analysis was applied to the relationships between (a) the performer's intention and the cues and (b) the listeners' judgments and the cues. The analyses of performers and listeners were related using C. J. Hursch, K. R. Hammond, and J. L. Hursch's (1964) lens model equation. The results indicated that (a) performers were successful at communicating emotions to listeners, (b) performers' cue utilization was well matched to listeners' cue utilization, and (c) cue utilization was more consistent across different melodies than across different performers. Because of the redundancy of the cues, 2 performers could communicate equally well despite differences in cue utilization.",

To address this, psychophysiological measures were recorded while listners heard two excerpts chosen to represent each of three emotions: sad, fear, and happy. The measures covered a fairly wide spectrum of cardiac, vascular, electrodermal, and respiratory functions. Other subjects indicated dynamic changes in emotions they experienced while listening to the music on one of four scales: sad, fear, happy, and tension. Both physiological and emotion judgements were made on a second-by-second basis. The physiological measures all showed a significant effect of music compared to the pre-music interval. A number of analyses, including correlations between physiology and emotion judgments, found significant differences among the excerpts. The sad excerpts produced the largest changes in heart rate, blood pressure, skin conductance and temperature. The fear excerpts produced the largest changes in blood transit time and amplitude. The happy excerpts produced the largest changes in the measures of respiration. These emotion-specific physiological changes only partially replicated those found for nonmusical emotions. The physiological effects of music observed generally support the emotivist view of musical emotions.",

Study 1 (N = 102) used an open-ended questionnaire to identify behavioral categories.

Study 3 used psychotherapist (N = 26) judgments of the likely success of the strategies. Therapist and self-rating converged on success of strategies and gender differences. These studies clarify and confirm previous research findings, particularly gender differences in controlling depression. Exercise appears to be the most effective mood-regulating behavior, and the best general strategy to change a bad mood is a combination of relaxation, stress management, cognitive, and exercise techniques. Results support a 2-dimensional biopsychological model of mood.",

Major recent developments include the use of electronic forms of data collection and multilevel models in data analysis. We identify several areas of research opportunities: 1. in technology, combining electronic diary reports with collateral measures such as ambulatory heart rate; 2. in measurement, switching from measures based on between-person differences to those based on within-person changes; and 3. in research questions, using diaries to (a) explain why people differ in variability rather than mean level, (b) study change processes during major events and transitions, and (c) study interpersonal processes using dyadic and group diary methods.",

One powerful emotional effect induced by music is a shivery, gooseflesh type of skin sensation (commonly called \"chills\" or \"thrills\"), which may reflect the brain9s ability to extract specific kinds of emotional meaning from music. A large survey indicated that college-age students typically prefer to label this phenomenon as \"chills\" rather than \"thrills,\" but many mistakenly believe that happiness in music is more influential in evoking the response than sadness. A series of correlational studies analyzing the subjective experience of chills in groups of students listening to a variety of musical pieces indicated that chills are related to the perceived emotional content of various selections, with much stronger relations to perceived sadness than happiness. As a group, females report feeling more chills than males do. Because feelings of sadness typically arise from the severance of established social bonds, there may exist basic neurochemical similarities between the chilling emotions evoked by music and those engendered by social loss. Further study of the \"chill\" response should help clarify how music interacts with a specific emotional process of the normal human brain.",

Requirements for the application of multimodal interaction theory in the musical domain are discussed. We introduce the concept of bidirectional complementarity to characterize the relationship between the component sensing technologies. Each control can be used independently, but together they are mutually complementary. This reveals a fundamental difference from orthogonal systems. The creation of a concert piece based on this system is given as example.",

Thanks to this residency, her ongoing long-distance collaboration with the team since 2007 dramatically accelerated, and led to solving several compositional and calibration issues of the GestureFollower (GF). Kimura was also the first artist to develop projects between the two teams at IRCAM, using OMAX (Musical Representation Team) with GF. In the past year, the performance with Augmented Violin has been expanded in larger scale interactive audio/visual projects as well.

            "abstract": "This paper takes two approaches to describe aspects of physical interfaces in the electronic arts. One approach takes a Human Factors point of view at the different interactions hat can take place in electronic art, and the other more practical approach describes sensor technologies (and a sensor categorisation) to make the physical interaction possible. In this introduction the historical development of the ergonomic aspects of the design of instruments are described. Because the earliest examples of the usage of electronic media to make art can be found in music, and because music has a long tradition of performance and of a precise and i timate relationship between human and technology, this paper often takes electronic musical instruments as a starting point. From there, the paper aims to describe the general field of art forms using electronics (visual arts, installations, architecture, network, music). Humans have always been making music by using objects and artefacts. Every known way of generating sound, using strings, bells, reeds etc. has been used to make musical instruments. In all stages of engineering (manual / mechanical / electromechanical / electronic / digital) the technology was reflected in the instruments. The nature of the sound generating process traditionally dictated the design of the instrument. Take for instance bowing a string. On a violin the strings are short and therefore fit on an instrument that is held under the player's chin. Longer strings to reach lower registers called for a bigger instrument, for instance the cello that rests with a pin on the ground and is held between the player's knees. Even longer and thicker strings for bass notes demands such a big instrument that the player has to stand next to it and embrace it. In instruments that use electricity in any form this relationship is often less clear.",

            "title": "Making Motion Musical: Gesture Mapping Strategies for Interactive Computer Music",
            "abstract": "The increase in sophistication of new devices that allow gesture and movement to be translated into computer data holds great promise for interactive composition, dance, and creating responsive music in virtual reality systems. Data describing human motion can produce musically satisfying results by their impact on sound and musical processes. This paper will take a general look at the use of physical gesture data as primary compositional constraints in interactive music systems. Theoretical concepts for the interpretation and evaluation of these data will be discussed. Finally, these devices and techniques will be shown be viable in multimedia applications. Background The invention of the Theremin in 1919 prophesied the development of music produced by electrical means and is even more remarkable as the first musical instrument performed without physical touch. The results produced by moving the hands in space were more subtle and varied than a simple oscillator would suggest because the sound reflected the expressive quality of human movement. The world caught up with Leon Theremin in the 1960s and 1970s when several composers rediscovered the exploration of movement to create electronic music. Of particular note is Variations V (1965), a collaborative work featuring music by John Cage and choreography by Merce Cunningham, with a system designed by Gordon Mumma and David Tudor to derive sounds from the movements of dancers, who produced music based on their proximity to several electronic sensors placed on stage. Thus, the entire floor was transformed into a musical instrument responsive to movement throughout the space (Nyman). Since the 1980s, the sophistication and accuracy of digital technology has brought opportunities for the further refinement of motion-based instruments. Researchers in both dance and music have created numerous systems showing the viability of using computers to interpret data from motion detectors and body sensors. Years of ongoing work at STEIM and the MIT Media Lab are of particular interest in this area. Corporate interests are now pushing their own research and we will soon be inundated with body suits, gloves, motion detectors, and other devices for virtual reality environments. In addition, physical computer interface devices not intended specifically for music, such as a mouse, have been frequently used to perform or shape computer music processes. While these devices may lack the resolution and refinement of musical instruments, composers have already proven that any device that translates physical movement into numbers is fair game for an interactive musical performance (as witnesses by the frequent adaptation of Mattel's Nintendo PowerGlove). The abundance of successful research will insure composers reliable and accurate movement data. With many of these technicalities solved, some attention can now be shifted away from instrument building and towards musical performance and composition. Specifically, how can composers create music based on movement data? How can movement be used to shape and structure musical material? What specific performance parameters will create and modify sound? It is doubtful that such movement data can be simply applied to pre-existing musical models. An examination of the physical parameters of movement, their limitations, and the methods used for their measurement, will yield clues to an appropriate musical response, one where imaginative connections engage performers by their power to shape sound. In his insightful essay on \"Effort and Expression,\" Joel Ryan states that \"in fact, the physicality of the performance interface gives definition to the modeling process itself\" (Ryan). Interactive music systems can be used to interpret these data, extending the performer's power of expression beyond a simple one-to-one relationship of triggered sound, to include the control of compositional processes, musical structure, signal processing, and sound synthesis. Characteristics of Movement Transducers Looking at acoustic instruments and their related digital models, motion makes music by exciting physical devices that produce sound or MIDI data. Physical energy is transformed into sound through a musical instrument mechanism. Two different classes of movement transducers are the focus of this discussion. Although the wide variety of devices for detecting movement have unique sensing apparatuses, capabilities, and features, many share common attributes. Spatial sensors detect location in space, by proximity to hardware sensors or by location within a projected grid. Body sensors measure the angle, force, or position of various parts of the body. These two methods are by no means mutually exclusive. Examples of spatial sensors includes the Radio Drum (Mathews), which measures the location of two batons in three dimensions in relation to a rectangular radio receiver; Donald Buchla's Lightning (Rich), which uses an infrared signal to locate a performer within a user-definable two-dimensional grid, and several systems that analyze location and movement in space using video cameras, such as David Rokby's Very Nervous System (Cooper), and the Virtual Stage Environment (Lovell). Inexpensive pressure triggers, light beams, and motion detectors have been used extensively to identify a person's location within a space. Examples of body sensors include MIDI Dancer (Coniglio), which analyzes body shape by measuring the angles of arm, leg, and hip joints; BioMuse (Knapp and Lufsted), which measures electrical voltages produced by muscle contraction, and a host of hand-based controllers such as The Hands (Waiswicz), which also measures proximity. Regardless of sensor type, it is important to recognize not only what is being measured, but how it is being measured. These devices specify a limited range of motion (left-right, high-low, open-closed) and divide that range into a limited number of discrete steps, with data sent out more or less continuously along this range. The resolution or scale of these steps, as well as the device sampling rate will be factors in musical interpretation. These numbers can be filtered, scaled, limited or otherwise processed by software in preparation for entering an interactive system. Some devices may have less continuous reporting, sending out values representing predetermined trigger points. These numbers determine the location or body position of a performer over time within a pre-defined range. Timing and location may be used to determine the speed or force of an action. Software can interpret these numbers to create music based on either a performer's exact location or position, or by movement relative to a previous location or position. The number of parameters transmitted by a device also defines some of its musical capabilities. Spatial sensors work in one, two, or three dimensions. Body sensors may track one or more parts of the body. Movement as an Instrument Does human movement have constraints similar to musical instruments which might suggest something akin to idiomatic expression? Is there a distinct character to the movement of the hands? What is finger music? What is running music? What is the sound of one hand clapping? These questions may be answered by allowing the physicality of movement to impact on musical material and processes. These relationships may be established by viewing the body and space as musical instruments, free from the associations of acoustic instruments, but with similar limitations that can lend character to sound through idiomatic movements. Traditional studies in orchestration, as well as studies in sound synthesis, begin by examining the physical properties of instruments and their methods for producing sound. Physical constraints produce unique timbral characteristics, and suggest musical material that will be idiomatic or appropriate for a particular instrument's playing technique. These reflect the weight, force, pressure, speed, and range used to produce sound. In turn, the sound reflects, in some way, the effort or energy used to create it. The fact that brass tones add upper partials as they grow louder is a classic example. Each part of the body has its unique limitation in terms of direction, weight, range of motion, speed and force. In addition, actions can be characterized by ease of execution, accuracy, repeatability, fatigue, and response. The underlying physics of movement lends insight into the selection of musical material. Thus, a delicate curling of the fingers should produce a very different sonic result than a violent and dramatic leg kick, since the size, weight and momentum alone would have different physical ramifications. To do this, physical parameters can be appropriately mapped to musical parameters, such as weight to density or register, tension to dissonance, or physical space to simulated acoustical space, although such simple one-to-one correspondences are not always musically successful. The composer's job then, is not only to map movement data to musical parameters, but to interpret these numbers to produce musically satisfying results. The stage, room, or space also has its boundaries, limiting speed, direction, and maneuverability. Psychological intensity increases or decreases with stage position, as the audience perceives more energy and focus as the performer moves upstage. Apparent gravity pulls the performer downstage with less effort, in a way similar to the very real pull of vertical downward motion. Intensity may also vary with the amount of activity confined to a given space. These physical and psychological properties of space are ripe for musical interpretation. Being aware of the underlying physics of movement does not necessarily imply an obvious musical solution. Indeed, since computers are only simulating real world events, tampering with the apparent laws of physics is a luxury made possible in virtual environments. By being aware of these la",

This interface enables users to control and interact with the game console without the need to touch a controller. It largely increases the users’ degree of freedom to express their emotion. In this paper, we first describe the system we developed to use this interface for sound generation and controlling musical expression. The skeleton data are extracted from users’ motions and the data are translated to pre-defined MIDI data. We then use the MIDI data to control several applications. To allow the translation between the data, we implemented a simple Kinect-to-MIDI data convertor, which is introduced in this paper. We describe two applications to make music with Kinect: we first generate sound with Max/MSP, and then control the adlib with our own adlib generating system by the body movements of the users.",

            "abstract": "We present the design and implementation of the Conductor's Jacket, a unique wearable device that measures physiological and gestural signals, together with the Gesture Construction, a musical software system that interprets these signals and applies them expressively in a musical context. Sixteen sensors have been incorporated into the Conductor's Jacket in such a way as to not encumber or interfere with the gestures of a working orchestra conductor. The Conductor's Jacket system gathers up to sixteen data channels reliably at rates of 3 kHz per channel, and also provides real-time graphical feedback. Unlike many gesture-sensing systems it not only gathers positional and accelerational data but also senses muscle tension from several locations on each arm. The Conductor's Jacket was used to gather conducting data from six subjects, three professional conductors and three students, during twelve hours of rehearsals and performances. Analyses of the data yielded thirty-five significant features that seem to reflect intuitive and natural gestural tendencies, including context-based hand switching, anticipatory 'flatlining' effects, and correlations between respiration and phrasing. The results indicate that muscle tension and respiration signals reflect several significant and expressive characteristics of a conductor's gestures. From these results we present nine hypotheses about human musical expression, including ideas about efficiency, intentionality, polyphony, signal-to-noise ratios, and musical flow state. Finally, this thesis describes the Gesture Construction, a musical software system that analyzes and performs music in realtime based on the performers gestures and breathing signals. A bank of software filters extracts several of the features that were found in the conductor study, including beat intensities and the alternation between arms. These features are then used to generate real-time expressive effects by shaping the beats, tempos, articulations, dynamics, and note lengths in a musical score.

            "abstract": "Gestures have long been considered an interaction technique that can potentially deliver more natural, creative and intuitive methods for communicating with our computers. For over 40 years, gestures provided an alternative input mode to the keyboard and mouse interactions for most application domains, employing an array of technologies to control multitude of tasks. But how do we make sense of the expanse of this technique so that we may approach gestures from a theoretical perspective, and understand its role in human computer interactions? Existing research tends to focus on the technology, exploring novel methods for enabling gestures, and the tasks they can afford. However few researchers have approached the discipline with the intent of building a cohesive understanding of gestures and the relationships that exist between the different systems and interactions. In this work, we present a theoretical framework to support a systematic approach to researching and designing gesture-based interactions. We propose four categories —physical gestures, input devices, output technologies, and user goals —as the basis from which the framework extends. Each category is defined in terms of manipulatable parameters, and their affect on the user experience. Parameters can be tested using empirical experiments, and amended using qualitative methods. The framework is intended for use as a tool to guide research and design, and presents a structure for providing a theoretical understanding of gesture interactions. Our research began with a review and analysis of the gesture literature, preceded by a series of studies and experiments, which lead to the development of the theoretical framework. This thesis presents a detailed discussion of the qualitative and quantitative research that led to the development of framework, its structure and components, and examples of its application towards a theoretical approach to research an design of gestures for human computer interactions.",

Consequently, the endeavor of sophisticated digital instrument design has been accessible to the creative community for several years, which has resulted in a host of new instruments that explore a variety of physical mappings. The emphasis on physicality exhibited by so-called “gestural controllers” stands in contrast to the practice of conventional laptop performance. While the laptop computer is certainly a digital musical instrument, its associated performance practice is often criticized based on a perceived lack of physicality. This paper examines motivations behind the foregrounding of gesture in computer-based performance.

            "abstract": "I shall devote the body of this paper to a description of experiments with rats. But I shall also attempt in a few words at the close to indicate the significance of these findings on rats for the clinical behavior of men. Most of the rat investigations, which I shall report, were carried out in the Berkeley laboratory. But I shall also include, occasionally, accounts of the behavior of non-Berkeley rats who obviously have misspent their lives in out-of-State laboratories. Furthermore, in reporting our Berkeley experiments I shall have to omit a very great many. The ones I shall talk about were carried out by graduate students (or underpaid research assistants) who, supposedly, got some of their ideas from me. And a few, though a very few, were even carried out by me myself. Let me begin by presenting diagrams for a couple of typical mazes, an alley maze and an elevated maze. In the typical experiment a hungry rat is put at the entrance of the maze (alley or elevated), and wanders about through the various true path segments and blind alleys until he finally comes to the food box and eats. This is repeated (again in the typical experiment) one trial every 24 hours and the animal tends to make fewer and fewer errors (that is, blindalley entrances) and to take less and less time between start and goal-box until finally he is entering no blinds at all and running in a very few seconds from start to goal. The results are usually presented in the form of average curves of blind-entrances, or of seconds from start to finish, for groups of rats. All students agree as to the facts. They disagree, however, on theory and explanation. (1) First, there is a school of animal psychologists which believes that the maze behavior of rats is a matter of mere simple stimulus-response connections. Learning, according to them, consists in the strengthening of some of these connections and in the weakening of others. According to this ‘stimulus-response’ school the rat in progressing down the maze is helplessly responding to a succession of external stimulisights, sounds, smells, pressures, etc. impinging upon his external sense organs-plus internal stimuli coming from the viscera and from the skeletal muscles.

            "abstract": "Real time and gestual monitoring of the production of synthesised sound has been part of the permanent preoccupations of musical informatics since its beginning. The conditions imposed by the standard mode of communication with the computer and by the time taken by calculation at the start of musical informatics placed the musician in a situation far removed from his usual action or description modes, and, in particular, ruled out an instrumental type of relationship. Today, as real time synthesis has been possible for several years, numerous devices are being developed to meet the specific demands of the instrumental Relationship efficiently and in a differentiated way. However, in complete contrast to questions relative to synthesis or compositional models, gestual monitoring has given rise especially to technical developments, with a view to approaching as near as possible given traditional instrumental situations, at the expense of sufficient theoretical reflection focused fundamentally on the role of the instrumental gesture, its status and its application in an informatic tool for musical creation. It is, however, apparent that the instrumental gesture is not mere monitoring. In \" natural \" sound production by acoustic instruments, this gesture participates intimately with the physical phenomenon and directly determines some of its decisive attributes for perception and musicality. It has simultaneously a concrete function : required for sound production and a symbolic one : the instrument and its accompanying gesture are two causes that combine to produce the sound effect, and, for this reason, the sound effect bears the perceptual indices that are specifically related to the gesture. The indices may remain present and significant in the sound object when this contributes to the composition of a musical structure. In the perspective of creating concepts and pertinent tools for computer assisted musical creation, it seems vital to us to consider the question of the musical gesture more in depth that from purely superficial ergonomic considerations. The object of this paper is to present, whilst attempting to situate it in the general conceptual framework of composition, a particular point of view taking the instrumental gesture, via the computer, as an object that composition may operate on. From this we have deduced the functional specificities that should be included in the conception of a musical creation informatic tool.",

This movement is related to both the musical score execution and the emotional intention conveyed. In this experiment, a pianist was asked to play the same excerpt with different emotionally expressive intentions. The aim was to verify whether different expressions could be distinguished based on movement by trying to determine which motion cues were most emotion-sensitive. Analyses were performed via an automated system capable of detecting the temporal profiles of two motion cues: the quantity of motion of the upper body and the velocity of head movements. Results showed that both were sensitive to emotional expression, especially the velocity of head movements. Further, some features conveying information about movement temporal dynamics varied among expressive conditions allowing emotion discrimination. These results are in line with recent theories that underlie the dynamic nature of emotional expression.",

Imagery is the internal representation of a stimulus, experienced in the presence or absence of that stimulus. Imagery may be of different types, such as visual (imagined seeing), auditory (imagined words or sounds), spatial (imagined distances or placement), or kinaesthetic (imagined movement). The thought processes that musicians use in this regard are not well-documented. This lack of knowledge contributes to the mystique that surrounds music literacy, a mystique that, in turn, does little to help student musicians develop useful strategies for performing and listening to music. The aim of the study in the first instance was to find out what types of thought processes musicians actively employ during their work. The research expanded progressively to become an exploration of the psychological and physical tools musicians use when they perform and listen to music. The underlying premise was that there is an inner voice with multiple manifestations, and that musicians have the capacity to generate such internal imagery.

            "abstract": "Introduction ‘Language’ and ‘gesture’ have long been held to be different, yet at the same time a relationship between them has always been recognized. However, whether they are regarded as belonging together or not depends upon how these words are defined. Thus if, with Armstrong, Stokoe & Wilcox, we accept Studdert-Kennedy's (1987: 77) definition of ‘gesture’ as “an equivalence class of coordinated movements that achieve some end” (see Armstrong et al. 1995: 43), then, insofar as both speech and, let us say, gestures of the hands are comprised of “coordinated movements that achieve some end,” it is possible to argue for a fundamental identity between the one and the other, as indeed they have done. On the other hand, if we insist, as some have, that a defining feature of language is that it be spoken, then this seems forever to make it impossible to see ‘gesture’ as part of ‘language’. However, if we define language in a more abstract fashion, and allow that its medium of realization is not one of its defining features, then whether or not ‘gesture’ is to be seen as a part of language depends upon what other features are insisted upon. For example, if we follow Saussure's definition of language, so long as ‘gestures’ can be shown to be arbitrary form-meaning pairs differentiated in contrastive relationships and organized paradigmatically and syntagmatically, they can be regarded as a form of language. On these grounds, gesture systems such as primary or alternate sign languages would be included, but we might exclude such modes of expression as improvised or locally created gesturings such as may be observed in many of the gestures used concurrently with speech.",

        "abstract": "L anguage has been granted too much power. The linguistic turn, the semiotic turn, the interpretative turn, the cultural turn: it seems that at every turn lately every “thing”—even materiality—is turned into a matter of language or some other form of cultural representation. The ubiquitous puns on “matter” do not, alas, mark a rethinking of the key concepts (materiality and signification) and the relationship between them. Rather, it seems to be symptomatic of the extent to which matters of “fact” (so to speak) have been replaced with matters of signification (no scare quotes here). Language matters. Discourse matters. Culture matters. There is an important sense in which the only thing that does not seem to matter anymore is matter. What compels the belief that we have a direct access to cultural representations and their content that we lack toward the things represented? How did language come to be more trustworthy than matter? Why are language and culture granted their own agency and historicity while matter is figured as passive and immutable, or at best inherits a potential for change derivatively from language and culture? How does one even go about inquiring after the material conditions that have led us to such a brute reversal of naturalist beliefs when materiality itself is always already figured within a linguistic domain as its condition of possibility?",

            "abstract": "How can we understand the world as a whole instead of separate natural and human realms? Joseph T. Rouse proposes an approach to this classic problem based on radical new conceptions of both philosophical naturalism and scientific practice. Rouse begins with a detailed critique of modern thought on naturalism, from Neurath and Heidegger to Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn and W.V.O. Quine. He identifies two constraints central to a philosophically robust naturalism: it must impose no arbitrarily philosophical restrictions on science, and it must shun even the most subtle appeals to mysterious and supernatural forces. Thus a naturalistic approach requires philosophers to show that their preferred conception of nature is what scientific inquiry discloses, and that their conception of scientific understanding is itself intelligible as part of the natural world. Finally, Rouse draws on feminist science studies and other recent work on causality and discourse to demonstrate the crucial role that closer attention to scientifc practice can play in reclaiming naturalism.",

            "abstract": "How to Succeed in School Without Really Learning: The Credentials Race in American Education, by David Labaree. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1997. 328 PP. $35.00 David Labaree adds to a very large body of literature that criticizes American schooling. In How to Succeed in School Without Really Learning he describes the relationship and contradictions between social mobility (private good), social efficiency, and democratic equality (public good). His thesis is that the pursuit of credentials (grades, degrees, etc.), as private good, has come to dominate and actually hinder students from acquiring knowledge and learning skills that would make them better citizens and better contributers to the capitalist economy. Labaree follows the earlier credential theorists, Boudon (1974) Collins (1979) and Brown (1995), adding information from his historical case study of an American high school. His arguments are clear and cogent, but for readers who anticipate new solutions to education's \"crisis\" there may be disappointment. In the final chapter, Labaree simply states: \"Social mobility, I conclude, needs to be balanced by democratic equality and social efficiency, or else we wi ll continue to reproduce an educational system that is mired in consumerism and credentialism.\" The formula by which such a balance is to be achieved is not provided by Labaree. To be sure, credentialist theory has much to offer in describing the state of professionalism in American schooling today, and Labaree lays out its major themes clearly and concisely in his first chapter. In his next three chapters he focuses upon \"the sorting and selecting of students within schools\" by examining the historical roots, consequences, and implications of that process. This is followed by an analysis of education stratification from a market perspective. \"From this perspective, the processes of selection and stratification that characterize education are the result not simply of societal needs but of individual demands, as individual consumers pursue symbolic advantages that will enhance their competitive position. The logic that governs these processes is that of the market.\" Labaree states that \"arguments most often found in the literature [ldots] draw on either human capital theory or social reproduction theory,\" a practice he finds to be inadequate. But this is an unnecessary simplification of a large body of literature that has much to offer as well as to reject. Though he is rightly concerned about the slight of individual agency, Labaree's market individualism takes the other extreme, which is equally insufficient as an approach aimed at describing the \"root causes\" of education's woes. Consistent with liberalism, Labaree accepts the contradiction between corporate and democratic values as necessary and wants to promote both. That corporate capitalism undermines both political and educational democracy is well documented (e.g., Barrow, 1990; Callahan, 1962; Hollinger, 1996; Lustig, 1982; Ophuls, 1997; Weinstein, 1968). Rather than attempting to balance the conflicting goals by putting social needs above personal desires, a better solution is to make the two identical (Benedict, 1992). But Labaree gives no credence to the possibility of a democratic economic system that meets, as Bowles and Gintis (1992) phrase it, \"the demanding criteria of fostering fundamental fairness, the dignity of the human person, and enhanced social participation\" (p. 3). A major contention of Labaree is \"that the central problems with education in the United States are not pedagogical or organizational or social or cultural in nature but are fundamentally political.\" Labaree claims a tie to Weber, but does not seem to appreciate that \"class, status, and party\" have to be grasped as phenomena of the distribution of power (Giddens, 1982). Thus, completely absent is any discussion of the influence of corporate power on schooling in particular and society as a whole (e. …",

Another part of this fear of chaos and lack of learning lies in conventional ideas about what learning is. Many teachers, themselves schooled in conventional educational institutions, believe that their role is to fill students with curricular information. They might argue that students, who don’t know what they don’t know, cannot possibly exercise choice and freedom in curricular content to create real learning. The idea that knowledge can be stuffed into the individual, as opposed to being constructed and mediated through the individual (Lamm 1972), has led to the conventional educational practices of mandated courses and pre-established syllabi. Teachers are used to coming, and in fact are expected by both students and their administrators to come, to the first class with content ready for delivery to interchangeable students. Teachers may feel that if they arrive without a pre-set syllabus and lesson plans, students and administrators will view them as weak, unprepared, or lacking in authority. The class’s disrespect could lead to poor course and teacher evaluations as well as jeopardize their jobs. Besides losing control, teachers might also fear silence and an emptiness if they attempt democratic practices. They might also fear that some students will take over and silence others. Last, inviting student voice and choice might ill prepare students for the “real world,” where they will have to learn to bow their wills to others and see their needs go unmet (Guterson 1996). Conventionally schooled teachers who dare to implement democratic practices must grapple with all these fears. They must be willing to abandon plans and adjust to the process of dialogue; they must learn to listen more than talk, not apply one lesson plan to all sections of the same class, and surrender their authoritarian supports (Shor 1996). They must learn to trust students’ innate curiosity, and if this curiosity has been crushed in the past, they must work to bring it back to life. Teachers must take to heart what Rogers wrote in Freedom to Learn (1969): educational HORIZONS Fall 2008"

        "abstract": "This letter proposes a framework which is able to generate a sequence of three-dimensional human dance poses for a given music. The proposed framework consists of three components: a music feature encoder, a pose generator, and a music genre classifier. We focus on integrating these components for generating a realistic 3D human dancing move from music, which can be applied to artificial agents and humanoid robots. The trained dance pose generator, which is a generative autoregressive model, is able to synthesize a dance sequence longer than 1,000 pose frames. Experimental results of generated dance sequences from various songs show how the proposed method generates human-like dancing move to a given music. In addition, a generated 3D dance sequence is applied to a humanoid robot, showing that the proposed framework can make a robot to dance just by listening to music.",

We compare different combinations of the modules in building CNN architectures. The results show that they achieve significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art models on the MagnaTagATune dataset and comparable results on Million Song Dataset.

Given a new sequence modeling task or dataset, which architecture should one use? We conduct a systematic evaluation of generic convolutional and recurrent architectures for sequence modeling. The models are evaluated across a broad range of standard tasks that are commonly used to benchmark recurrent networks. Our results indicate that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer effective memory. We conclude that the common association between sequence modeling and recurrent networks should be reconsidered, and convolutional networks should be regarded as a natural starting point for sequence modeling tasks.

            "abstract": "Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.",

The proposed generative model is a generative adversarial network (GAN), which is based on the sequence to sequence (SEQ2SEQ) model. Using the proposed generative network, we can synthesize various actions for a robot or a virtual agent using a text encoder recurrent neural network (RNN) and an action decoder RNN. The proposed generative network is trained from 29,770 pairs of actions and sentence annotations extracted from MSR-Video-to-Text (MSR-VTT), a large-scale video dataset. We demonstrate that the network can generate human-like actions which can be transferred to a Baxter robot, such that the robot performs an action based on a provided sentence. Results show that the proposed generative network correctly models the relationship between language and action and can generate a diverse set of actions from the same sentence.",

            "abstract": "Synthesizing human’s movements such as dancing is a flourishing research field which has several applications in computer graphics. Recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of deep neural networks (DNNs) for achieving remarkable performance in motion and music tasks with little effort for feature pre-processing. However, applying DNNs for generating dance to a piece of music is nevertheless challenging, because of 1) DNNs need to generate large sequences while mapping the music input, 2) the DNN needs to constraint the motion beat to the music, and 3) DNNs require a considerable amount of hand-crafted data. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep recurrent method for real-time basic dance generation with audio power spectrum as input. The proposed model employs convolutional layers and a multilayered Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) to process the audio input. Then, another deep LSTM layer decodes the target dance sequence. Notably, this end-to-end approach has 1) an auto-conditioned decode configuration that reduces accumulation of feedback error of large dance sequence, 2) uses a contrastive cost function to regulate the mapping between the music and motion beat, and 3) trains with weak labels generated from the motion beat, reducing the amount of hand-crafted data. We evaluate the proposed network based on i) the similarities between generated and the baseline dancer motion with a cross entropy measure for large dance sequences, and ii) accurate timing between the music and motion beat with an F-measure. Experimental results revealed that, after training using a small dataset, the model generates basic dance steps with low cross entropy and maintains an F-measure score similar to that of a baseline dancer.",

Studies on how to synthesize music-oriented dance choreography can promote research in many fields, such as dance teaching and human behavior research. Although considerable effort has been directed toward investigating the relationship between music and dance, the synthesis of appropriate dance choreography based on music remains an open problem. There are two main challenges: 1) how to choose appropriate dance figures, i.e., groups of steps that are named and specified in technical dance manuals, in accordance with music and 2) how to artistically enhance choreography in accordance with music. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a music-oriented dance choreography synthesis method using a long short-term memory (LSTM)-autoencoder model to extract a mapping between acoustic and motion features. Moreover, we improve our model with temporal indexes and a masking method to achieve better performance. Because of the lack of data available for model training, we constructed a music-dance dataset containing choreographies for four types of dance, totaling 907,200 frames of 3D dance motions and accompanying music, and extracted multidimensional features for model training. We employed this dataset to train and optimize the proposed models and conducted several qualitative and quantitative experiments to select the best-fitted model. Finally, our model proved to be effective and efficient in synthesizing valid choreographies that are also capable of musical expression.",

We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

To this end, we ﬁrst collected a set of multimedia clips that include both music and corresponding dance motion. We then extract the joint coordinates of the dancer from video and the mel-spectrogram of music from audio and train our network using music-choreography pairs as input. Finally, a novel dance motion is generated at the inference time when only music is given as an input. We performed a user study for a qualitative evaluation of the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed model is able to generate musi-cally meaningful and natural dance movements given an unheard song. We also revealed through quantitative evaluation that the network has created a movement that correlates with the beat of music.",

Using techniques from signal processing, our method calculates certain emotional transforms which are then applied to existing motions of articulated gures in order to produce the same motions, but with an emotional quality such as angry or sad. These transforms capture the dierence between a neutral and emotional movement with respect to two components: speed (timing), and spatial amplitude (range) of a movement. Since the transforms are applied as global operations , they provide a convenient and ecient way to adapt motion-captured, simulated or keyframed animation of articulated gures to dierent situations and characters.",

Unfortunately, successful applications are limited by the variability in the signal and the consequent poor quality of estimates. I propose to use a nonlinear recursive filter based on Bayesian estimation. The desired filtered signal is modeled as a combined diffusion and jump process and the measured electromyographic (EMG) signal is modeled as a random process with a density in the exponential family and rate given by the desired signal. The rate is estimated on-line by calculating the full conditional density given all past measurements from a single electrode. The Bayesian estimate gives the filtered signal that best describes the observed EMG signal. This estimate yields results with very low short-time variability but also with the capability of very rapid response to change. The estimate approximates isometric joint torque with lower error and higher signal-to-noise ratio than current linear methods. Use of the nonlinear filter significantly reduces noise compared with current algorithms, and it may therefore permit more effective use of the EMG signal for prosthetic control, biofeedback, and neurophysiology research.",

We endeavor to facilitate exploration of new paradigms for such interaction by translating sensed input data into abstract control streams, providing a network of signal processing and analytic tools for gestural interpretation, and facilitating the translation of the processed control streams into arbitrary interactions. We have experimented with fully-embodied interactions that control parameterized 3D geometric models projected onto 2D or 3D surfaces, and, in parallel, control algorithms that produce sound. Our overarching goal is to enable the fully embodied human to control any and all aspects of a virtual and/or augmented reality environment. This paper presents aspects of the mWorlds [1,2,10] framework that enable the exploration of multimodal gestural controls for interactive environments, and describes our application of it to a series of performances.",

Drawing on embodied theories of cognition, the author argues that thinking about power involves mental simulation of space and can be interfered with by perception of vertical differences. Study 1 assessed image schemas for power and found a shared vertical difference metaphor. Studies 2, 3, and 4 showed that the judgment of a group's power is influenced by the group's vertical position in space and motor responses implying vertical movement. Study 5 ruled out that the influence of vertical position on power judgments is driven by valence differences. Study 6 showed that vertical position also influences the power judgment result itself. The evidence suggests that the concept of power is partly represented in perceptual form as vertical difference.",

The publishers deserve a vote of thanks for the care that is apparent in the physical layout, typography, binding, and especially the price. Such dedication to scholarly publication at prices which scholars can afford is meritorious indeed. We may hope that the commercial success of the book will stimulate them and others to similar efforts. It is also a very enjoyable and intellectually stimulating book which raises, and occasionally answers, a number of important linguistic questions. It is written in a direct and accessible style; while it introduces and uses a number of new terms, for the most part it is free of jargon. This is no doubt part of its appeal to nonlinguists, though linguists should also find it useful and provocative. It even has possibilities as a textbook.

On the perceptual side, the dominant cognitive view largely underestimates, and thus fails to account for, the impact of action-related processes on both the processing of perceptual information and on perceptual learning. On the action side, most approaches conceive of action planning as a mere continuation of stimulus processing, thus failing to account for the goal-directedness of even the simplest reaction in an experimental task. We propose a new framework for a more adequate theoretical treatment of perception and action planning, in which perceptual contents and action plans are coded in a common representational medium by feature codes with distal reference. Perceived events (perceptions) and to-be-produced events (actions) are equally represented by integrated, task-tuned networks of feature codes--cognitive structures we call event codes. We give an overview of evidence from a wide variety of empirical domains, such as spatial stimulus-response compatibility, sensorimotor synchronization, and ideomotor action, showing that our main assumptions are well supported by the data.",

Existing theoretical positions are summarized and evaluated in view of this critical evidence and the 2 major candidate theories ―relative speed of processing and automaticity of reading― are found to be wanting.

Height was somewhat more strongly related to success for men (rho =.29) than for women (rho =.21), although this difference was not significant. Finally, given that almost no research has examined the relationship between individuals' physical height and their incomes, we present four large-sample studies (total N = 8,590) showing that height is positively related to income (beta =.26) after controlling for sex, age, and weight. Overall, this article presents the most comprehensive analysis of the relationship of height to workplace success to date, and the results suggest that tall individuals have advantages in several important aspects of their careers and organizational lives.",

Study I supported the model's assumption that high- and low-prejudice persons are equally knowledgeable of the cultural stereotype. The model suggests that the stereotype is automatically activated in the presence of a member (or some symbolic equivalent) of the stereotyped group and that Iow-prejudiee responses require controlled inhibition of the automatically activated stereotype. Study 2, which examined the effects of automarie stereotype activation on the evaluation of ambiguous stereotype-relevant behaviors performed by a race-unspecified person, suggested that when subjects' ability to consciously monitor stereotype activation is precluded, both high- and low-prejudice subjects produce stereotype-congruent evaluations of ambiguous behaviors. Study 3 examined high- and low-prejudice subjects' responses in a consciously directed thought-listing task. Consistent with the model, only low-prejudice subjects inhibited the automatically activated stereotype-congruent thoughts and replaced them with thoughts reflecting equality and negations of the stereotype. The relation between stereotypes and prejudice and implications for prejudice reduction are discussed.",

            "abstract": "F OR a long time it has been suspected that certain standing and sitting postures might be culturally significant (Mauss 1935). Although some (e.g., Driver 1937:118) have doubted that such behaviors are consistent enough to enable anyone to draw useful conclusions about them, others have not hesitated to deal in systematic fashion with the postural habits of particular cultures (Irizawa 1920-21; Mead and Macgregor 1951; Bailey 1942). For example, following a discussion of Mohave sitting postures, Kroeber (1925:728) asserted, \"this [i.e., posture] is one of the most interesting matters in the whole range of customs .... \" However, in spite of this interest, there have been almost no attempts to bring the scattered data together into a comprehensive world-wide framework. Mauss' Les techniques du corps (1935) was a stimulating program for such an undertaking-nothing more. Human postural habits have anatomical and physiological limitations, but there are a great many choices, the determinants for which appear to be mostly cultural. The number of significantly different body attitudes capable of being maintained steadily is probably on the order of one thousand. Certain postures may occur in all cultures without exception, and may form a part of our basic hominid heritage. The upright stance with arms at the sides, or with hands clasped in the midline over the lower abdomen, certainly belongs in this category. A fourth of mankind habitually squats in a fashion very similar to the squatting position of the chimpanzee, and the rest of us might squat this way too if we were not trained to use other postures beyond infancy. Anthropoid postures may shed some light on the problem of which human ones are most likely to be \"natural\" or precultural, although ape limb proportions would deter us from relying too heavily on such evidence. Of factors which affect postures, aside from the biological substrata, we might start with sex-differentiating conditions such as pregnancy and lactation, which possibly render certain sitting positions more frequent among adult females, and nutritional conditions (not wholly independent of culture), which may determine the amount of fat accumulated in posturally strategic parts of the body. Fear of genital exposure, whatever its etiology, seems to play an important role in postural customs (or at least in their rationale) in many cultures. Clothing and footgear, such as heavy boots and tight-fitting skirts, doubtless exert their effects on ways of sitting. Artificial supports-whether logs, rocks, stools, pillows, back rests, benches, or chairs-are highly significant, with complex histories and manifold cultural interconnections. There is also a relation of types of house-construction to posture.",

            "abstract": "Mental Models offers nothing less than a unified theory of the major properties of mind: comprehension, inference, and consciousness. In spirited and graceful prose, Johnson-Laird argues that we apprehend the world by building inner mental replicas of the relations among objects and events that concern us. The mind is essentially a model-building device that can itself be modeled on a digital computer. This book provides both a blueprint for building such a model and numerous important illustrations of how to do it. In several key areas of cognition, Johnson-Laird shows how an explanation based on mental modeling is clearly superior to previous theory. For example, he argues compellingly that deductive reasoning does not take place by tacitly applying the rules of logic, but by mentally manipulating models of the states of affairs from which inferences are drawn. Similarly, linguistic comprehension is best understood not as a matter of applying inference rules to propositions derived from sentences, but rather as the mind's effort to construct and update a model of the situation described by a text or a discourse. Most provocative, perhaps, is Johnson-Laird's theory of consciousness: the mind's necessarily incomplete model of itself allows only a partial control over the many unconscious and parallel processes of cognition. This an extraordinarily rich book, providing a coherent account of much recent experimental work in cognitive psychology, along with lucid explanations of relevant theory in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy Not since Miller, Galanter, and Pribram's classic Plans and the Structure of Behavior has a book in cognitive science combined such sweep, style, and good sense. Like its distinguished predecessor, Mental Models may well serve to fix a point of view for a generation.

            "abstract": "A view-based approach to the representation and recognition of human movement is presented. The basis of the representation is a temporal template-a static vector-image where the vector value at each point is a function of the motion properties at the corresponding spatial location in an image sequence. Using aerobics exercises as a test domain, we explore the representational power of a simple, two component version of the templates: The first value is a binary value indicating the presence of motion and the second value is a function of the recency of motion in a sequence. We then develop a recognition method matching temporal templates against stored instances of views of known actions. The method automatically performs temporal segmentation, is invariant to linear changes in speed, and runs in real-time on standard platforms.",

We present a new image registration technique that makes use of the spatial intensity gradient of the images to find a good match using a type of Newton-Raphson iteration. Our technique is taster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show how our technique can be adapted tor use in a stereo vision system.",

The current study investigated the general ability to decode happiness, sadness, anger, and fear in dance forms of expressive body movement and the specific ability to detect differences in the intensity of anger and happiness when the relative amount of movement cue specifying each emotion was systematically varied. Four-year-olds (n = 25), 5-year-olds (n = 25), 8-year-olds (n = 29), and adults (n = 24) completed an emotion contrast task and 2 emotion intensity tasks. Decoding ability exceeding chance levels was demonstrated for sadness by 4-year-olds; for sadness, fear, and happiness by 5-year-olds: and for all emotions by 8-year-olds and adults. Children as young as 5 years were shown to rely on emotion-specific movement cues in their decoding of anger and happiness intensity. The theoretical significance of these effects across development is discussed.",

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls \"embodied interaction\" -- an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality -- reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.",

            "title": "The meaning of the body : aesthetics of human understanding",
            "abstract": "In \"The Meaning of the Body\", Mark Johnson continues his pioneering work on the exciting connections between cognitive science, language, and meaning first begun in the classic \"Metaphors We Live By\". Johnson uses recent research into infant psychology to show how the body generates meaning even before self-consciousness has fully developed. From there he turns to cognitive neuroscience to further explore the bodily origins of meaning, thought, and language and examines the many dimensions of meaning - including images, qualities, emotions, and metaphors - that are all rooted in the body's physical encounters with the world. Drawing on the psychology of art and pragmatist philosophy, Johnson argues that all of these aspects of meaning-making are fundamentally aesthetic. He concludes that the arts are the culmination of human attempts to find meaning and that studying the aesthetic dimensions of our experience is crucial to unlocking meaning's bodily sources.Throughout, Johnson puts forth a bold new conception of the mind rooted in the understanding that philosophy will matter to nonphilosophers only if it is built on a visceral connection to the world.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents a novel application of speech emotion recognition: estimation of the level of conversational engagement between users of a voice communication system. We begin by using machine learning techniques, such as the support vector machine (SVM), to classify users’ emotions as expressed in individual utterances. However, this alone fails to model the temporal and interactive aspects of conversational engagement. We therefore propose the use of a multilevel structure based on coupled hidden Markov models (HMM) to estimate engagement levels in continuous natural speech. The first level is comprised of SVM-based classifiers that recognize emotional states, which could be (e.g.) discrete emotion types or arousal/valence levels. A high-level HMM then uses these emotional states as input, estimating users’ engagement in conversation by decoding the internal states of the HMM. We report experimental results obtained by applying our algorithms to the LDC EMOTIONAL PROSODY and CALLFRIEND speech corpora.",

            "title": "Computational Analytical Framework for Affective Modeling: Towards Guidelines for Designing Computational Models of Emotions",
            "abstract": "Computational affective models are being developed both to elucidate affective mechanisms, and to enhance believability of synthetic agents and robots. Yet in spite of the rapid growth of computational affective modeling, no systematic guidelines exist for model design and analysis. Lack of systematic guidelines contributes to ad hoc design practices, hinders model sharing and re-use, and makes systematic comparison of existing models and theories challenging. Lack of a common computational terminology also hinders cross-disciplinary communication that is essential to advance our understanding of emotions. In this chapter the author proposes a computational analytical framework to provide a basis for systematizing affective model design by: (1) viewing emotion models in terms of two core types: emotion generation and emotion effects, and (2) identifying the generic computational tasks necessary to implement these processes. The chapter then discusses how these computational ‘building blocks’ can support the development of design guidelines, and a systematic analysis of distinct emotion theories and alternative means of their implementation. 1.0 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES The past 15 years have witnessed a rapid growth in computational models of emotion and affective agent architectures. Researchers in cognitive science, AI, HCI, robotics and gaming are developing ‘models of emotion’, primarily to create more believable and effective synthetic characters and robots, and to enhance human-computer interaction. Less frequently, these models are being developed for basic research purposes, to help elucidate the nature of the mechanisms mediating affective a variety of affective phenomena.

It has a rich set of applications, ranging from tracking users' opinions about products or about political candidates as expressed in online forums, to customer relationship management. Functional to the extraction of opinions from text is the determination of the orientation of ``subjective'' terms contained in text, i.e. the determination of whether a term that carries opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation. In this paper we present a new method for determining the orientation of subjective terms. The method is based on the quantitative analysis of the glosses of such terms, i.e. the definitions that these terms are given in on-line dictionaries, and on the use of the resulting term representations for semi-supervised term classification. The method we present outperforms all known methods when tested on the recognized standard benchmarks for this task.",

            "abstract": "Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: \\emph{Gradient-based One-Side Sampling} (GOSS) and \\emph{Exclusive Feature Bundling} (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB \\emph{LightGBM}. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.",

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.",

Starting from a three-way classification of construals of the world––events, the attribution of responsibility for events, and objects––the authors propose a systematic account of emotion differentiation. Rejecting the oft-favored features of bodily feelings, emotion-related behaviors, and facial expressions as too intensity-dependent and insufficiently diagnostic, they provide a detailed analysis of emotion differentiation in terms of the cognitive underpinnings of emotion types. Using numerous examples, they explain how different variables influence emotion intensity, and show how emotions can be formalized for computational purposes. Now with a contributed chapter describing the OCC model's influence, this book will interest a wide audience in cognitive, clinical, and social psychology, as well as in artificial intelligence and affective computing, and other cognitive science disciplines.",

To that end, we leverage 400 million Twitter microposts to generate powerful word embeddings as input features and use a neural network to execute the classification. To further boost the performance, we employ dropout to train the network and leaky Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs). Our system achieved the fourth position in the final ranking, without using any kind of hand-crafted features such as lexical features or gazetteers.",

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.",

            "abstract": ". Over the last quarter-century, there is increasing body of research on understanding the human emotions. In this study, automatic classification of anger, disgust, fear, joy and sad emotions in text have been studied on the ISEAR (International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions) dataset. For the classification we have used Vector Space Model with a total of 801 news headlines provided by “Affective Task” in SemEval 2007 workshop which focuses on classification of emotions and valences in text. We have compared our results with ConceptNet and powerful text based classifiers including Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines. Our experiments showed that VSM classification gives better performance than ConceptNet, Naive Bayes and SVM based classifiers for emotion detection in sentences. We achieved an overall F-measure value of 32.22% and kappa value of 0.18 for five class emotional text classification on SemEval dataset which is better than Navie Bayes (28.52%), SVM (28.6%). We have tested and discussed the results of classification using cross-validation technique for emotion classification and sentiment analyses on both the ISEAR and SemEval datasets. In addition to the classification experiments we have developed an emotion enabled video player which automatically detects the emotion from subtitle text of video and displays corresponding emoticon.",

This survey has been inspired on the well-known fact that, despite there is a lot of work on emotional detection systems, a lot of work is expected to be done yet. The increment of these systems is due to the large amount of emotional data available in Social Web. Detecting emotions from text have attracted the attention of many researchers in computational linguistics because it has a wide range of applications, such as suicide prevention or measuring well-being of a community. This paper mainly collects works based on lexical and machine learning approaches and these works are classificated in accordance with the emotional model and the approach used.",

            "abstract": "There has long been interest in describing emotional experience in terms of underlying dimensions, but traditionally only two dimensions, pleasantness and arousal, have been reliably found. The reasons for these findings are reviewed, and integrating this review with two recent theories of emotions (Roseman, 1984; Scherer, 1982), we propose eight cognitive appraisal dimensions to differentiate emotional experience. In an investigation of this model, subjects recalled past experiences associated with each of 15 emotions, and rated them along the proposed dimensions. Six orthogonal dimensions, pleasantness, anticipated effort, certainty, attentional activity, self-other responsibility/control, and situational control, were recovered, and the emotions varied systematically along each of these dimensions, indicating a strong relation between the appraisal of one's circumstances and one's emotional state. The patterns of appraisal for the different emotions, and the role of each of the dimensions in differentiating emotional experience are discussed.",

Our system employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, including bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) and LSTM with attention mechanism. We perform transfer learning by first pre-training the LSTM networks on sentiment data before concatenating the penultimate layers of these networks into a single vector as input to new dense layers.

This paper describes TeamUNCC’s system to detect emotions in English and Arabic tweets. Our approach is novel in that we present the same architecture for all the five subtasks in both English and Arabic. The main input to the system is a combination of word2vec and doc2vec embeddings and a set of psycholinguistic features (e.g. from AffectTweets Weka-package). We apply a fully connected neural network architecture and obtain performance results that show substantial improvements in Spearman correlation scores over the baseline models provided by Task 1 organizers, (ranging from 0.03 to 0.23). TeamUNCC’s system ranks third in subtask El-oc and fourth in other subtasks for Arabic tweets.",

Especially in social media such as Twitter, due to the space constraints, the sources of information that can be mined are even more limited due to character limitations. These limitations constitute a challenge for understanding short social media posts. In this paper, we present an approach that utilizes multiple binary classifiers that represent different affective categories to model Twitter posts (e.g., tweets). We train domain-independent recurrent neural network models without any outside information such as affect lexicons. We then use these domain independent binary ranking models to evaluate the applicability of such deep learning models on the affect identification task. This approach allows different model architectures and parameter settings for each affect category instead of building one single multi-label classifier. The contributions of this paper are two-folds: we show that modeling tweets with a small training set is possible with the use of RNNs and we also prove that formulating affect identification as a binary classification task is highly effective.",

            "abstract": "Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classiﬁcation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).",

Each one analyzes input data from a different aspect and produces an emotion label as output. The first subsystem is a machine learning method. The second one is a statistical approach based on vector space model (VSM) and the last one is a keyword-based subsystem with an information fusion component to aggregate the final output of main system. We analyzed the performance of our proposed system on ISEAR dataset with seven emotions: anger, joy, sad, shame, fear, disgust and guilt. The results show that our combinational system outperforms each subsystem with overall f-measure of 0.68 and at least up to 0.71 in terms of F1 in emotion level except for anger. The overall performance of the main system is 9.13% better than machine learning module, 16.6% better than VSM and 23% better than keyword-based.",

            "abstract": "Existing Machine Learning techniques yield close to human performance on text-based classification tasks. However, the presence of multi-modal noise in chat data such as emoticons, slang, spelling mistakes, code-mixed data, etc. makes existing deep-learning solutions perform poorly. The inability of deep-learning systems to robustly capture these covariates puts a cap on their performance. We propose NELEC: Neural and Lexical Combiner, a system which elegantly combines textual and deep-learning based methods for sentiment classification. We evaluate our system as part of the third task of ‘Contextual Emotion Detection in Text’ as part of SemEval-2019. Our system performs significantly better than the baseline, as well as our deep-learning model benchmarks. It achieved a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.7765, ranking 3rd on the test-set leader-board.

These methods, therefore, are not sufficient to create an applicable and generalizable emotion detection methodology. Understanding these limitations, we present a new network based on a bidirectional GRU model to show that capturing more meaningful information from text can significantly improve the performance of these models. The results show significant improvement with an average of 26.8 point increase in F-measure on our test data and 38.6 increase on the totally new dataset.",

Because resonance requires developing overall solutions, it unites research areas and capitalizes on their strengths. The fact that pleasant and attractive products actually work better [14] is an example that the whole exceeds the sum of its parts. Moreover, designing for resonance enables individuals to create their own experiences. In this paper we elaborate on the advantages of resonance and show on the basis of two interactive installations how to find salient aspects of resonance. ISH explores visual and musical group performances through tangible interaction. Coppia Espressiva studies in depth two forms of tangible interaction: phycons (i.e. physical icons) and expressive dynamic behavior. Experimental tests with both installations show that diversity of interaction is a prerequisite to obtain resonance. Furthermore, a proper mapping between appearance, interaction, functionality and temptation increases resonance.",

            "abstract": "Recent developments in design research concentrate on two themes (1) the unity of form, function and interaction and (2) the semantics of movement. The Design Movement approach incorporates unity of form, function and interaction through movement. Design Movement introduces the design of products as an integral part of Choreography of Interaction, and thus as an integral part of (the design of) movement. This approach therefore puts forward a distinctive view on the relation of product form and movement in interaction design and, consequently, a view on semantics. In this paper we introduce this challenging view. In order to do so, we explain the framework of Choreography of Interaction, its motivation, and the way the ‘interaction choreographer’ uses it to create interaction. The framework is based on the idea that movement (1) is the embodiment of interaction and (2) comprises the trinity of Physical Involvement, Dynamic Quality and Expressed Meaning in interaction. The framework incorporates the way Design Movement approaches the relation of product form, movement and semantics for interaction design. We realize that theoretically describing this approach is a nearly impossible venture. In fact, only through movement, through practicing it, the idea can actually be grasped. Therefore, we commence with examples of projects to illustrate our endeavour.",

        "abstract": "The arts provide openings for symbolic expression by engaging the sensory experience in the body they become a source of insight through embodied cognition and emotion, enabling meaning-making, and acting as a catalyst for change. This synthesis of sensation and enactive, embodied expression through movement and the arts is capitalized on in The BodyMind Approach® (TBMA). It is integral to this biopsychosocial, innovative, unique intervention for people suffering medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) applied in primary healthcare. The relevance of embodiment and arts practices in TBMA are discussed in relation to the views of participants in the pursuit of self-management. If widely employed TBMA could have an enormous impact, reach, and significance for patients and global health services. This original pre-clinical trial of qualitative research reports on the perceptions of participant patients with generic MUS, a world-wide issue usually treated by either psychological therapy or physiotherapy. TBMA is not a therapy but a health education program founded upon the concept of an integration of psychological elements with physiological, bodily, and sensory experiences. Thematic analysis of qualitative data sets from open-ended questions in semi-structured interviews and a written questionnaire post intervention is presented. Five aspects which appear to be key to learning self-management were derived from analyzing the data: (1) body with mind connections; (2) importance of facilitation; (3) potential benefits; (4) preparedness for change; (5) self-acceptance/compassion. This article advances the discourse on the nature of self-management for MUS through changing the mind-set and the relationship participants have with their bodily symptom/s through employing embodied methods and arts practices, challenging current, and solely verbal, psychological conceptual frameworks. Rigor lies in the method of data analysis using cross verification of credibility between reported findings and scrutiny by stakeholders. We conclude that facilitated TBMA groups employing embodied methods and arts practices can act as a method for developing the self-management of MUS and improving wellbeing.",

Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) refer to persistent bodily complaints for which adequate examination (including investigation) does not reveal sufficiently explanatory structural or other specified pathology.1 MUS are common, with a spectrum of severity, and patients are found everywhere within the healthcare system.2 It has been estimated that MUS account for up to 45% of all general practice consultations,3 while a study based in secondary care indicated that about 50% of patients had no clear diagnosis at 3 months.2\n\nThe annual NHS cost for MUS in adults of working age in England was estimated to be £2.89 billion in 2008/2009 (approximately 10% of total NHS expenditure on these services for the working age population), while sickness absence and decreased quality of life for people with MUS was estimated as costing over £14 billion per annum to the UK economy.4\n\nAlthough the costs to the NHS and the economy are important considerations, the personal cost to the patient can also be significant. Patients often experience stress, distress, and anxiety because of their unexplained symptoms. They report feeling that their concerns are not taken seriously by their doctor, which can exacerbate the presentation of somatic symptoms. The suggestion that ‘negative test results means that nothing is wrong’ is cited as the most common explanation given by doctors,5 but patients can feel that their symptoms are not believed, and may disengage from health care (including for other …",

The methodological quality and heterogeneity (I2) of the retrieved trials were analyzed. The prevalence rates of medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorders, and their subcategories were estimated, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), with the aid of random-effects modeling.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom a total of 992 identified publications, 32 studies from 24 countries involving a total of 70 085 patients (age range, 15-95 years) were selected for further analysis. All had been carried out between 1990 and 2012. The primary studies were more heterogeneous overall; point prevalences for the strict diagnosis of a somatization disorder ranged from 0.8% (95% CI 0.3-1.4%, I2 = 86%) to 5.9% (95% CI 2.4-9.4%, I2 = 96%), with higher estimated prevalences in studies that applied less restrictive diagnostic criteria. At least one type of somatoform disorder was diagnosable by DSM-IV and/or ICD-10 criteria in a fraction of primary-care patients that ranged from 26.2% (95% CI 19.1-33.3%, I2 = 98%) to 34.8% (95% CI 26.6-44.6%; I2 = 92%). The percentage of patients complaining of at least one medically unexplained symptom ranged from 40.2% (95% CI 0.9-79.4%; I2 = 98%) to 49% (95% CI 18-79.8%, I2 = 98%). The quality of the studies, in general, was only moderate. No relationship was found between study quality and prevalence estimates.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe statistical heterogeneity of the included studies is very high. Somatoform disorders and medically unexplained symptoms are more common than generally assumed. The found prevalences highlight the importance of these conditions in primary care.",

Togetherness seems to conflict with individuality- the idiosyncratic character of each person's performance. To understand the relation of individuality and togetherness, we employed the mirror game paradigm in which two players are asked to mirror each other and create interesting synchronized motion, with and without a designated leader. The mirror game enables quantitative characterization of moments of togetherness in which complex motion is generated with high synchrony. We find that each person as a leader does basic strokes of motion with a characteristic signature, in terms of the shape of their velocity profile between two stopping events. In moments of togetherness both players change their signature to a universal stroke shape. This universal velocity profile resembles a half-period of a sine wave, and is therefore symmetric and maximally smooth. Thus, instead of converging to an intermediate motion signature, or having one player dominate, players seem to shift their basic motion signatures to a shape that is altogether different from their individually preferred shapes; the resulting motion may be easier to predict and to agree on. The players then build complex motion by using such smooth elementary strokes.",

            "abstract": "Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are common in both primary and secondary health care. It is gradually being acknowledged that there needs to be a variety of interventions for patients with MUS to meet the needs of different groups of patients with such chronic long-term symptoms. The proposed intervention described herewith is called The BodyMind Approach (TBMA) and promotes learning for self-management through establishing a dynamic and continuous process of emotional self-regulation. The problem is the mismatch between the patient’s mind-set and profile and current interventions. This theoretical article, based on practice-based evidence, takes forward the idea that different approaches (other than cognitive behavioral therapy) are required for people with MUS. The mind-set and characteristics of patients with MUS are reflected upon to shape the rationale and design of this novel approach. Improving services for this population in primary care is crucial to prevent the iterative spiraling downward of frequent general practitioner (GP) visits, hospital appointments, and accident and emergency attendance (A&E), all of which are common for these patients. The approach derives from embodied psychotherapy (authentic movement in dance movement psychotherapy) and adult models of learning for self-management. It has been developed from research and practice-based evidence. In this article the problem of MUS in primary care is introduced and the importance of the reluctance of patients to accept a psychological/mental health referral in the first instance is drawn out. A description of the theoretical underpinnings and philosophy of the proposed alternative to current interventions is then presented related to the design, delivery, facilitation, and educational content of the program. The unique intervention is also described to give the reader a flavor.",

Through the vivid examples taken from her own practice Adler demonstrates that physical movement can invite direct experience of spiritual truths.

            "abstract": "Many fields have explored the nature of mental life from psychology to psychiatry, literature to linguistics. Yet no common \"framework\" where each of these important perspectives can be honored and integrated with one another has been created in which a person seeking their collective wisdom can find answers to some basic questions, such as, What is the purpose of life? Why are we here? How do we know things, how are we conscious of ourselves? What is the mind? What makes a mind healthy or unwell? And, perhaps most importantly: What is the connection among the mind, the brain, and our relationships with one another? Our mental lives are profoundly relational. The interactions we have with one another shape our mental world. Yet as any neuroscientist will tell you, the mind is shaped by the firing patterns in the brain. And so how can we reconcile this tension-that the mind is both embodied and relational? Interpersonal Neurobiology is a way of thinking across this apparent conceptual divide. This Pocket Guide to Interpersonal Neurobiology is designed to aid in your personal and professional application of the interpersonal neurobiology approach to developing a healthy mind, an integrated brain, and empathic relationships. It is also designed to assist you in seeing the intricate foundations of interpersonal neurobiology as you read other books in the Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology. Praise for Daniel J.

            "abstract": "In the current climate of theoretical change, psychoanalysis is seeking a theory of interaction. We propose that principles of interactive organization documented in infant research have analogues in adult treatment. A systems model of the integration of self and mutual regulation is used to draw analogies, but not one-to-one correspondences, between infant research and adult psychoanalysis. We specifically address how self and mutual regulation impact on each other, arguing that internal and relational processes are simultaneously organized, in relation to each other, at all developmental levels. Co-constructing inner and relational processes: Self and mutual regulation in infant research and adult treatment Psychoanalysis has tended to privilege inner state as the focus of inquiry. Freud (l923) argued that perceptions of what goes on in the environment are never as important as those arising from within; that internal perceptions are more primordial, more elementary than perceptions arising externally, and that they have greater economic significance. Perceptions of the outer world are often seen as distorted through projections of the inner state. Instead, we suggest that the \"inner\" and the \"outer\" worlds are co-constructed, and thus are not separate domains. We distinguish between the two domains, but see them as fundamentally coordinated. By not privileging \"inner\" or \"outer\", and by emphasizing their reciprocal co- construction, we examine how dyadic process may (re-) organize both inner and relational processes, and reciprocally, how changes in self-regulation in either partner may alter the interactive process. In the past decade, efforts at conceptualizing systems views have been evident in both infant research and psychoanalysis. Each field, however, has come from the opposite bias. Heavily preoccupied with interactive regulation in the dyad, infant research on social development is only now seriously examining self regulation (see Tronick, 1989; Fox, 1994; Thompson, 1994). Similarly, psychoanalysis originally explicated the organization of inner states, and has only more recently seriously examined interaction in the dyad. Current versions of systems thinking conceptualizing interaction in psychoanalysis can be found, for example, in Stolorow, Atwood, and Brandschaft's (1987) intersubjectivity, Mitchell's (1988) relational psychoanalysis, Hoffman's (1983) and Gill's (1994) constructivist views, Aron's (1996) mutuality, Lichtenberg's (1989; Lichtenberg, Lachmann, & Fosshage, 1992) placement of five motivational systems within a mutual regulation model, Benjamin's (1988;1990) intersubjectivity, Ehrenberg's (1994) intimate edge, and Beebe, Jaffe, and Lachmann's (1992) dyadic systems model. These theorists all have in common the attempt to refine conceptualizations of psychoanalytic interaction. Systems thinking has also been implicit in much twentieth century psychoanalysis. For example, Ferenczi (1928), Balint (1968),",

It proposes a theory of learning for an innovative, research-informed intervention, The BodyMind Approach® (TBMA) aimed at developing confidence, competence, skills, and knowledge and understanding for self-management for people with medically unexplained symptoms. TBMA is interdisciplinary, combining embodiment and arts in health with transformative learning. Having explored the problem, the article presents TBMA and argues for how it cultivates the type of learning which sustains the self-management of symptoms. Promoting self-management fills the gap between patient needs and health service capacity. Previous studies identify learning through this method enables people to manage their symptoms when under stress in an ever-changing environment, supporting sufficient structure, agency, reflexivity, self-efficacy, and self-regulatory strategies to maintain resilience in the face of life adversity, despite their symptoms.",

        "abstract": "We present AIST++, a new multi-modal dataset of 3D dance motion and music, along with FACT, a Full-Attention Cross-modal Transformer network for generating 3D dance motion conditioned on music. The proposed AIST++ dataset contains 5.2 hours of 3D dance motion in 1408 sequences, covering 10 dance genres with multi-view videos with known camera poses—the largest dataset of this kind to our knowledge. We show that naively applying sequence models such as transformers to this dataset for the task of music conditioned 3D motion generation does not produce satisfactory 3D motion that is well correlated with the input music. We overcome these shortcomings by introducing key changes in its architecture design and supervision: FACT model involves a deep cross-modal transformer block with full-attention that is trained to predict N future motions. We empirically show that these changes are key factors in generating long sequences of realistic dance motion that are well-attuned to the input music. We conduct extensive experiments on AIST++ with user studies, where our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

            "abstract": "Recent progress in using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for image description has motivated the exploration of their application for video description. However, while images are static, working with videos requires modeling their dynamic temporal structure and then properly integrating that information into a natural language description model. In this context, we propose an approach that successfully takes into account both the local and global temporal structure of videos to produce descriptions. First, our approach incorporates a spatial temporal 3-D convolutional neural network (3-D CNN) representation of the short temporal dynamics. The 3-D CNN representation is trained on video action recognition tasks, so as to produce a representation that is tuned to human motion and behavior. Second we propose a temporal attention mechanism that allows to go beyond local temporal modeling and learns to automatically select the most relevant temporal segments given the text-generating RNN. Our approach exceeds the current state-of-art for both BLEU and METEOR metrics on the Youtube2Text dataset. We also present results on a new, larger and more challenging dataset of paired video and natural language descriptions.",

We introduce the task of dense-captioning events, which involves both detecting and describing events in a video. We propose a new model that is able to identify all events in a single pass of the video while simultaneously describing the detected events with natural language. Our model introduces a variant of an existing proposal module that is designed to capture both short as well as long events that span minutes. To capture the dependencies between the events in a video, our model introduces a new captioning module that uses contextual information from past and future events to jointly describe all events. We also introduce ActivityNet Captions, a large-scale benchmark for dense-captioning events. ActivityNet Captions contains 20k videos amounting to 849 video hours with 100k total descriptions, each with its unique start and end time. Finally, we report performances of our model for dense-captioning events, video retrieval and localization.",

For this we exploit recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTMs, which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image caption generation. Our LSTM model is trained on video-sentence pairs and learns to associate a sequence of video frames to a sequence of words in order to generate a description of the event in the video clip. Our model naturally is able to learn the temporal structure of the sequence of frames as well as the sequence model of the generated sentences, i.e. a language model.

Our approach reconciles classical slot filling approaches (that are generally better grounded in images) with modern neural captioning approaches (that are generally more natural sounding and accurate). Our approach first generates a sentence 'template' with slot locations explicitly tied to specific image regions. These slots are then filled in by visual concepts identified in the regions by object detectors. The entire architecture (sentence template generation and slot filling with object detectors) is end-to-end differentiable. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed model on different image captioning tasks. On standard image captioning and novel object captioning, our model reaches state-of-the-art on both COCO and Flickr30k datasets. We also demonstrate that our model has unique advantages when the train and test distributions of scene compositions - and hence language priors of associated captions - are different.

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

Our approach, dubbed the Dropout Autoencoder LSTM (DAELSTM), is capable of synthesizing natural looking motion sequences over long-time horizons1 without catastrophic drift or motion degradation. The model consists of two components, a 3-layer recurrent neural network to model temporal aspects and a novel autoencoder that is trained to implicitly recover the spatial structure of the human skeleton via randomly removing information about joints during training. This Dropout Autoencoder (DAE) is then used to filter each predicted pose by a 3-layer LSTM network, reducing accumulation of correlated error and hence drift over time. Furthermore to alleviate insufficiency of commonly used quality metric, we propose a new evaluation protocol using action classifiers to assess the quality of synthetic motion sequences. The proposed protocol can be used to assess quality of generated sequences of arbitrary length. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method on two of the largest motion-capture datasets available and show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of actions, including cyclic and acyclic motion, and that it can produce natural looking sequences over longer time horizons than previous methods.",

In this paper, we propose a music-driven choreography generation system using an auto-regressive encoder-decoder network. To this end, we first collect a set of multimedia clips that include both music and corresponding dance motion. We then extract the joint coordinates of the dancer from video and the mel-spectrogram of music from audio, and train our network using music-choreography pairs as input. Finally, a novel dance motion is generated at the inference time when only music is given as an input. We performed a user study for a qualitative evaluation of the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed model is able to generate musically meaningful and natural dance movements given an unheard song.",

While recent GANs have shown promising results, they can only forecast plausible motion over relatively short periods of time (few hundred milliseconds) and typically ignore the absolute position of the skeleton w.r.t. the camera. Our scheme provides long term predictions (two seconds or more) for both the body pose and its absolute position. Our approach builds upon three main contributions. First, we represent the data using a spatio-temporal tensor of 3D skeleton coordinates which allows formulating the prediction problem as an inpainting one, for which GANs work particularly well. Secondly, we design an architecture to learn the joint distribution of body poses and global motion, capable to hypothesize large chunks of the input 3D tensor with missing data. And finally, we argue that the L2 metric, considered so far by most approaches, fails to capture the actual distribution of long-term human motion. We propose two alternative metrics, based on the distribution of frequencies, that are able to capture more realistic motion patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach to significantly improve the state of the art, while also handling situations in which past observations are corrupted by occlusions, noise and missing frames.",

It consists of two separate steps: (1) estimating the 2D poses in multi-view images and (2) recovering the 3D poses from the multi-view 2D poses. First, we introduce a cross-view fusion scheme into CNN to jointly estimate 2D poses for multiple views. Consequently, the 2D pose estimation for each view already benefits from other views. Second, we present a recursive Pictorial Structure Model to recover the 3D pose from the multi-view 2D poses. It gradually improves the accuracy of 3D pose with affordable computational cost. We test our method on two public datasets H36M and Total Capture. The Mean Per Joint Position Errors on the two datasets are 26mm and 29mm, which outperforms the state-of-the-arts remarkably (26mm vs 52mm, 29mm vs 35mm).",

Existing work only implicitly models the spatial structure of the human skeleton. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the prediction into individual joints by means of a structured prediction layer that explicitly models the joint dependencies. This is implemented via a hierarchy of small-sized neural networks connected analogously to the kinematic chains in the human body as well as a joint-wise decomposition in the loss function. The proposed layer is agnostic to the underlying network and can be used with existing architectures for motion modelling. Prior work typically leverages the H3.6M dataset. We show that some state-of-the-art techniques do not perform well when trained and tested on AMASS, a recently released dataset 14 times the size of H3.6M. Our experiments indicate that the proposed layer increases the performance of motion forecasting irrespective of the base network, joint-angle representation, and prediction horizon. We furthermore show that the layer also improves motion predictions qualitatively. We make code and models publicly available at https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2019/spl.",

            "abstract": "Human motion is fundamental to understanding behavior. Despite progress on single-image 3D pose and shape estimation, existing video-based state-of-the-art methods fail to produce accurate and natural motion sequences due to a lack of ground-truth 3D motion data for training. To address this problem, we propose \"Video Inference for Body Pose and Shape Estimation'' (VIBE), which makes use of an existing large-scale motion capture dataset (AMASS) together with unpaired, in-the-wild, 2D keypoint annotations. Our key novelty is an adversarial learning framework that leverages AMASS to discriminate between real human motions and those produced by our temporal pose and shape regression networks. We define a novel temporal network architecture with a self-attention mechanism and show that adversarial training, at the sequence level, produces kinematically plausible motion sequences without in-the-wild ground-truth 3D labels. We perform extensive experimentation to analyze the importance of motion and demonstrate the effectiveness of VIBE on challenging 3D pose estimation datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Our method can produce a realistic dance video that conforms to the beats and rhymes of almost any given music. To achieve this, we firstly generate a human skeleton sequence from music and then apply the learned pose-to-appearance mapping to generate the final video. In the stage of generating skeleton sequences, we utilize two discriminators to capture different aspects of the sequence and propose a novel pose perceptual loss to produce natural dances. Besides, we also provide a new cross-modal evaluation to evaluate the dance quality, which is able to estimate the similarity between two modalities of music and dance. Finally, a user study is conducted to demonstrate that dance video synthesized by the presented approach produces surprisingly realistic results. The results are shown in the supplementary video at this https URL",

It is challenging due to not only the requirement of realistic and complex human motions for dance, but more importantly, the synthesized motions should be consistent with the style, rhythm and melody of the music. In this paper, we propose a novel autoregressive generative model, DanceNet, to take the style, rhythm and melody of music as the control signals to generate 3D dance motions with high realism and diversity. To boost the performance of our proposed model, we capture several synchronized music-dance pairs by professional dancers, and build a high-quality music-dance pair dataset.

However, well choreographed dance movements are extremely complex to animate and would involve an expensive and tedious production process. In addition to the use of complex motion capture systems, it typically requires a collaborative effort between animators, dancers, and choreographers. We introduce a complete system for dance motion synthesis, which can generate complex and highly diverse dance sequences given an input music sequence. As motion capture data is limited for the range of dance motions and styles, we introduce a massive dance motion data set that is created from YouTube videos. We also present a novel two-stream motion transformer generative model, which can generate motion sequences with high flexibility. We also introduce new evaluation metrics for the quality of synthesized dance motions, and demonstrate that our system can outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our system provides high-quality animations suitable for large crowds for virtual concerts and can also be used as reference for professional animation pipelines. Most importantly, we show that vast online videos can be effective in training dance motion models.",

Most previous works conduct music-to-dance synthesis via directly music to human skeleton keypoints mapping. Meanwhile, human choreographers design dance motions from music in a two-stage manner: they firstly devise multiple choreographic dance units (CAUs), each with a series of dance motions, and then arrange the CAU sequence according to the rhythm, melody and emotion of the music. Inspired by these, we systematically study such two-stage choreography approach and construct a dataset to incorporate such choreography knowledge. Based on the constructed dataset, we design a two-stage music-to-dance synthesis framework ChoreoNet to imitate human choreography procedure. Our framework firstly devises a CAU prediction model to learn the mapping relationship between music and CAU sequences. Afterwards, we devise a spatial-temporal inpainting model to convert the CAU sequence into continuous dance motions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ChoreoNet outperforms baseline methods (0.622 in terms of CAU BLEU score and 1.59 in terms of user study score).",

Our method generates emotionally expressive gestures by utilizing the relevant biomechanical features for body expressions, also known as affective features. We also consider the intended task corresponding to the text and the target virtual agents' intended gender and handedness in our generation pipeline. We train and evaluate our network on the MPI Emotional Body Expressions Database and observe that our network produces state-of-the-art performance in generating gestures for virtual agents aligned with the text for narration or conversation. Our network can generate these gestures at interactive rates on a commodity GPU. We conduct a web-based user study and observe that around 91% of participants indicated our generated gestures to be at least plausible on a five-point Likert Scale. The emotions perceived by the participants from the gestures are also strongly positively correlated with the corresponding intended emotions, with a minimum Pearson coefficient of 0.77 in the valence dimension.",

EDGE uses a transformer-based diffusion model paired with Jukebox, a strong music feature extractor, and confers powerful editing capabilities well-suited to dance, including joint-wise conditioning, and in-betweening. We introduce a new metric for physical plausibility, and evaluate dance quality generated by our method extensively through (1) multiple quantitative metrics on physical plausibility, beat alignment, and diversity benchmarks, and more importantly, (2) a large-scale user study, demonstrating a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.

This requires the identification and extraction of logically related motions scattered within some data set. Such content-based retrieval of motion capture data, which is the topic of this paper, constitutes a difficult and time-consuming problem due to significant spatio-temporal variations between logically related motions. In our approach, we introduce various kinds of qualitative features describing geometric relations between specified body points of a pose and show how these features induce a time segmentation of motion capture data streams. By incorporating spatio-temporal invariance into the geometric features and adaptive segments, we are able to adopt efficient indexing methods allowing for flexible and efficient content-based retrieval and browsing in huge motion capture databases. Furthermore, we obtain an efficient preprocessing method substantially accelerating the cost-intensive classical dynamic time warping techniques for the time alignment of logically similar motion data streams. We present experimental results on a test data set of more than one million frames, corresponding to 180 minutes of motion. The linearity of our indexing algorithms guarantees the scalability of our results to much larger data sets.",

This paper, on the other hand, considers a relatively new problem, which could be thought of as an inverse of action recognition: given a prescribed action type, we aim to generate plausible human motion sequences in 3D. Importantly, the set of generated motions are expected to maintain its diversity to be able to explore the entire action-conditioned motion space; meanwhile, each sampled sequence faithfully resembles a natural human body articulation dynamics. Motivated by these objectives, we follow the physics law of human kinematics by adopting the Lie Algebra theory to represent the natural human motions; we also propose a temporal Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) that encourages a diverse sampling of the motion space. A new 3D human motion dataset, HumanAct12, is also constructed. Empirical experiments over three distinct human motion datasets (including ours) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

            "abstract": "With the ongoing pandemic, virtual concerts and live events using digitized performances of musicians are getting traction on massive multiplayer online worlds. However, well choreographed dance movements are extremely complex to animate and would involve an expensive and tedious production process. In addition to the use of complex motion capture systems, it typically requires a collaborative effort between animators, dancers, and choreographers. We introduce a complete system for dance motion synthesis, which can generate complex and highly diverse dance sequences given an input music sequence. As motion capture data is limited for the range of dance motions and styles, we introduce a massive dance motion data set that is created from YouTube videos. We also present a novel two-stream motion transformer generative model, which can generate motion sequences with high flexibility. We also introduce new evaluation metrics for the quality of synthesized dance motions, and demonstrate that our system can outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our system provides high-quality animations suitable for large crowds for virtual concerts and can also be used as reference for professional animation pipelines. Most importantly, we show that vast online videos can be effective in training dance motion models.",

The proposed AIST++ dataset contains 5.2 hours of 3D dance motion in 1408 sequences, covering 10 dance genres with multi-view videos with known camera poses—the largest dataset of this kind to our knowledge. We show that naively applying sequence models such as transformers to this dataset for the task of music conditioned 3D motion generation does not produce satisfactory 3D motion that is well correlated with the input music. We overcome these shortcomings by introducing key changes in its architecture design and supervision: FACT model involves a deep cross-modal transformer block with full-attention that is trained to predict N future motions. We empirically show that these changes are key factors in generating long sequences of realistic dance motion that are well-attuned to the input music. We conduct extensive experiments on AIST++ with user studies, where our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Previous works treat this task as sequence generation, however, it is challenging to render a music-aligned long-term sequence with high kinematic complexity and coherent movements. In this paper, we reformulate it by a two-stage process, i.e., a key pose generation and then an in-between parametric motion curve prediction, where the key poses are easier to be synchronized with the music beats and the parametric curves can be efficiently regressed to render fluent rhythm-aligned movements. We named the proposed method as DanceFormer, which includes two cascading kinematics-enhanced transformer-guided networks (called DanTrans) that tackle each stage, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale music conditioned 3D dance dataset, called PhantomDance, that is accurately labeled by experienced animators rather than reconstruction or motion capture. This dataset also encodes dances as key poses and parametric motion curves apart from pose sequences, thus benefiting the training of our DanceFormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, even trained by existing datasets, can generate fluent, performative, and music-matched 3D dances that surpass previous works quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, the proposed DanceFormer, together with the PhantomDance dataset, are seamlessly compatible with industrial animation software, thus facilitating the adaptation for various downstream applications.",

Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.",

            "abstract": "Generating digital humans that move realistically has many applications and is widely studied, but existing meth-odsfocus on the major limbs of the body, ignoring the hands and head. Hands have been separately studied, but the fo-cus has been on generating realistic static grasps of objects. To synthesize virtual characters that interact with the world, we need to generate full-body motions and realistic hand grasps simultaneously. Both sub-problems are challenging on their own and, together, the state space of poses is sig-nificantly larger, the scales of hand and body motions dif-fer, and the whole-body posture and the hand grasp must agree, satisfy physical constraints, and be plausible. Additionally, the head is involved because the avatar must look at the object to interact with it. For the first time, we ad-dress the problem of generating full-body, hand and head motions of an avatar grasping an unknown object. As in-put, our method, called GOAL, takes a 3D object, its pose, and a starting 3D body pose and shape. GOAL outputs a sequence of whole-body poses using two novel networks. First, GNet generates a goal whole-body grasp with a re-alistic body, head, arm, and hand pose, as well as hand-object contact. Second, MNet generates the motion be-tween the starting and goal pose. This is challenging, as it requires the avatar to walk towards the object with foot-ground contact, orient the head towards it, reach out, and grasp it with a realistic hand pose and hand-object con-tact. To achieve this the networks exploit a representation that combines SMPL-X body parameters and 3D vertex off-sets. We train and evaluate GOAL, both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the GRAB dataset. Results show that GOAL generalizes well to unseen objects, outperforming baselines. A perceptual study shows that GOAL's gener-ated motions approach the realism of GRAB's ground truth. GOAL takes a step towards generating realistic full-body object grasping motion.

Most existing approaches train for a certain distribution of masks, which limits their generalization capabilities to unseen mask types. Furthermore, training with pixel-wise and perceptual losses often leads to simple textural extensions towards the missing areas instead of semantically meaningful generation. In this work, we propose RePaint: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based inpainting approach that is applicable to even extreme masks. We employ a pretrained unconditional DDPM as the generative prior. To condition the generation process, we only alter the reverse diffusion iterations by sampling the unmasked regions using the given image infor-mation. Since this technique does not modify or condition the original DDPM network itself, the model produces high-quality and diverse output images for any inpainting form. We validate our method for both faces and general-purpose image inpainting using standard and extreme masks. Re-Paint outperforms state-of-the-art Autoregressive, and GAN approaches for at least five out of six mask distributions. Github Repository: git.io/RePaint",

            "abstract": "Real-time in-between motion generation is universally required in games and highly desirable in existing animation pipelines. Its core challenge lies in the need to satisfy three critical conditions simultaneously: quality, controllability and speed, which renders any methods that need offline computation (or post-processing) or cannot incorporate (often unpredictable) user control undesirable. To this end, we propose a new real-time transition method to address the aforementioned challenges. Our approach consists of two key components: motion manifold and conditional transitioning. The former learns the important low-level motion features and their dynamics; while the latter synthesizes transitions conditioned on a target frame and the desired transition duration. We first learn a motion manifold that explicitly models the intrinsic transition stochasticity in human motions via a multi-modal mapping mechanism. Then, during generation, we design a transition model which is essentially a sampling strategy to sample from the learned manifold, based on the target frame and the aimed transition duration. We validate our method on different datasets in tasks where no post-processing or offline computation is allowed. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show that our method is able to generate high-quality motions measured under multiple metrics. Our method is also robust under various target frames (with extreme cases).",

Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and image-text alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters find Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment. To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models. With DrawBench, we compare Imagen with recent methods including VQ-GAN+CLIP, Latent Diffusion Models, and DALL-E 2, and find that human raters prefer Imagen over other models in side-by-side comparisons, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment.

Unlike previous work that represents motion as discrete sequential samples, we propose to express the vast motion space as a continuous function over time, hence the name Neural Motion Fields (NeMF). Specifically, we use a neural network to learn this function for miscellaneous sets of motions, which is designed to be a generative model conditioned on a temporal coordinate $t$ and a random vector $z$ for controlling the style. The model is then trained as a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with motion encoders to sample the latent space. We train our model with a diverse human motion dataset and quadruped dataset to prove its versatility, and finally deploy it as a generic motion prior to solve task-agnostic problems and show its superiority in different motion generation and editing applications, such as motion interpolation, in-betweening, and re-navigating.

First, the aesthetic styles and messages conveyed by the motion and music should be consistent. Second, the beats of the generated motion should be locally aligned to the musical features. And finally, basic choreomusical rules should be observed, and the motion generated should be diverse. To address these challenges, we propose ChoreoGraph, which choreographs high-quality dance motion for a given piece of music over a Dynamic Graph. A data-driven learning strategy is proposed to evaluate the aesthetic style and rhythmic connections between music and motion in a progressively learned cross-modality embedding space. The motion sequences will be beats-aligned based on the music segments and then incorporated as nodes of a Dynamic Motion Graph. Compatibility factors such as the style and tempo consistency, motion context connection, action completeness, and transition smoothness are comprehensively evaluated to determine the node transition in the graph. We demonstrate that our repertoire-based framework can generate motions with aesthetic consistency and robustly extensible in diversity. Both quantitative and qualitative experiment results show that our proposed model outperforms other baseline models.",

In order to remove the skill barriers for laymen, recent motion generation methods can directly generate human motions conditioned on natural languages. However, it remains challenging to achieve diverse and fine-grained motion generation with various text inputs. To address this problem, we propose MotionDiffuse, one of the first diffusion model-based text-driven motion generation frameworks, which demonstrates several desired properties over existing methods. 1) Probabilistic Mapping. Instead of a deterministic language-motion mapping, MotionDiffuse generates motions through a series of denoising steps in which variations are injected. 2) Realistic Synthesis. MotionDiffuse excels at modeling complicated data distribution and generating vivid motion sequences. 3) Multi-Level Manipulation. MotionDiffuse responds to fine-grained instructions on body parts, and arbitrary-length motion synthesis with time-varied text prompts. Our experiments show MotionDiffuse outperforms existing SoTA methods by convincing margins on text-driven motion generation and action-conditioned motion generation. A qualitative analysis further demonstrates MotionDiffuse's controllability for comprehensive motion generation.",

One hundred and six Mexican women completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, the Beliefs about and Attitudes toward Menstruation Questionnaire and the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire. The higher scores on benevolent sexism were associated with the most positive attitudes towards menstruation and also with the belief that a menstruating woman should or should not do some activities and that menstruation keeps women from their daily activities. The higher scores on hostile sexism were associated with rejection of menstruation as well as with feelings of embarrassment about it. Beliefs about and attitudes towards menstruation predicted menstrual cycle-related symptoms related to negative affect, impaired concentration and behavioural changes, but did not predict somatic symptoms. These results will be useful to health professionals and advocates who want to change the negative expectations and stereotypes of premenstrual and menstrual women and reduce the sexism and negative attitudes towards women that are evident in Mexican culture.",

Incidental exposure to sexist cues was employed in 3 experiments to investigate its effect on self-objectification variables. Consistent with system justification theory, exposure to benevolent and complementary forms of sexism, but not hostile or no sexism, increased state self-objectification, self-surveillance, and body shame among women but not men in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, we replicated these effects and demonstrated that they are specific to self-objectification and not due to a more general self-focus. In addition, following exposure to benevolent sexism only, women planned more future behaviors pertaining to appearance management than did men; this effect was mediated by self-surveillance and body shame. Experiment 3 revealed that the need to avoid closure might afford women some protection against self-objectification in the context of sexist ideology.",

These incidents affected women's psychological well-being by decreasing their comfort, increasing their feelings of anger and depression, and decreasing their state self-esteem. Although the experiences had similar effects on men's anger, depression, and state self-esteem, men reported relatively fewer sexist incidents, suggesting less overall impact on men. The results provide evidence for the phenomena of everyday prejudice and enlighten our understanding of the experience of prejudice in interpersonal encounters from the perspective of the target.",

We predicted that women would perceive an objectifier as less likable following sexual objectification and thus would distance themselves from the perpetrator. Study 1 found that objectification led female participants to perceive their male partner as less likable and to be less willing to affiliate with the partner. Study 2 replicated Study 1 in a concurrent interpersonal interaction and extended these effects to a man having a similar background with the perpetrator. Study 3 showed that power moderated the effect of sexual objectification on women's interaction intention such that only women with equal or low power (as compared to the objectifier) decreased their affiliation intention toward the objectifier, whereas high-power women did not show this effect. Implications of these findings were discussed. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Six ASI studies on 2,250 respondents established convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity.

        "abstract": "Following the success of deep convolutional networks, state-of-the-art methods for 3d human pose estimation have focused on deep end-to-end systems that predict 3d joint locations given raw image pixels. Despite their excellent performance, it is often not easy to understand whether their remaining error stems from a limited 2d pose (visual) understanding, or from a failure to map 2d poses into 3- dimensional positions.,,With the goal of understanding these sources of error, we set out to build a system that given 2d joint locations predicts 3d positions. Much to our surprise, we have found that, with current technology, \"lifting\" ground truth 2d joint locations to 3d space is a task that can be solved with a remarkably low error rate: a relatively simple deep feedforward network outperforms the best reported result by about 30% on Human3.6M, the largest publicly available 3d pose estimation benchmark. Furthermore, training our system on the output of an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art 2d detector (i.e., using images as input) yields state of the art results – this includes an array of systems that have been trained end-to-end specifically for this task. Our results indicate that a large portion of the error of modern deep 3d pose estimation systems stems from their visual analysis, and suggests directions to further advance the state of the art in 3d human pose estimation.",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of depth estimation from a single monocular image in this work. It is a challenging task as no reliable depth cues are available, e.g., stereo correspondences, motions etc. Previous efforts have been focusing on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information, with all using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are setting new records for various vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous characteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be naturally formulated into a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning problem. Therefore, we in this paper present a deep convolutional neural field model for estimating depths from a single image, aiming to jointly explore the capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. Specifically, we propose a deep structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. The proposed method can be used for depth estimations of general scenes with no geometric priors nor any extra information injected. In our case, the integral of the partition function can be analytically calculated, thus we can exactly solve the log-likelihood optimization. Moreover, solving the MAP problem for predicting depths of a new image is highly efficient as closed-form solutions exist. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation methods on both indoor and outdoor scene datasets.",

We propose a method of estimating 3D human poses from a single image, which works in conjunction with an existing 2D pose/joint detector. 3D pose estimation is challenging because multiple 3D poses may correspond to the same 2D pose after projection due to the lack of depth information. Moreover, current 2D pose estimators are usually inaccurate which may cause errors in the 3D estimation. We address the challenges in three ways: (i) We represent a 3D pose as a linear combination of a sparse set of bases learned from 3D human skeletons. (ii) We enforce limb length constraints to eliminate anthropomorphically implausible skeletons. (iii) We estimate a 3D pose by minimizing the 1-norm error between the projection of the 3D pose and the corresponding 2D detection. The 1-norm loss term is robust to inaccurate 2D joint estimations. We use the alternating direction method (ADM) to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts on three benchmark datasets.",

Our network takes an image and 3D pose as inputs and outputs a score value, which is high when the image-pose pair matches and low otherwise. The network structure consists of a convolutional neural network for image feature extraction, followed by two sub-networks for transforming the image features and pose into a joint embedding. The score function is then the dot-product between the image and pose embeddings. The image-pose embedding and score function are jointly trained using a maximum-margin cost function. Our proposed framework can be interpreted as a special form of structured support vector machines where the joint feature space is discriminatively learned using deep neural networks. We also propose an efficient recurrent neural network for performing inference with the learned image-embedding. We test our framework on the Human3.6m dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results compared to other recent methods.

A successful approach to alleviating the reconstruction ambiguity is the 3D deformable shape model and a sparse representation is often used to capture complex shape variability. But the model inference is still challenging due to the nonconvexity in the joint optimization of shape and viewpoint. In contrast to prior work that relies on an alternating scheme whose solution depends on initialization, we propose a convex approach to addressing this challenge and develop an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed convex program. We further propose a robust model to handle gross errors in the 2D correspondences. We demonstrate the exact recovery property of the proposed method, the advantage compared to several nonconvex baselines and the applicability to recover 3D human poses and car models from single images.",

            "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating detailed 3D structure from a single still image of an unstructured environment. Our goal is to create 3D models which are both quantitatively accurate as well as visually pleasing. For each small homogeneous patch in the image, we use a Markov random field (MRF) to infer a set of \"plane parameters\" that capture both the 3D location and 3D orientation of the patch. The MRF, trained via supervised learning, models both image depth cues as well as the relationships between different parts of the image. Inference in our model is tractable, and requires only solving a convex optimization problem. Other than assuming that the environment is made up of a number of small planes, our model makes no explicit assumptions about the structure of the scene; this enables the algorithm to capture much more detailed 3D structure than does prior art (such as Saxena et ah, 2005, Delage et ah, 2005, and Hoiem et el, 2005), and also give a much richer experience in the 3D flythroughs created using image-based rendering, even for scenes with significant non-vertical structure. Using this approach, we have created qualitatively correct 3D models for 64.9% of 588 images downloaded from the Internet, as compared to Hoiem et al.'s performance of 33.1%. Further, our models are quantitatively more accurate than either Saxena et al. or Hoiem et al.",

Following the success of regression forests for 3D pose estimation from depth data or 2D pose estimation from RGB images, we extend regression forests to infer missing depth data of image features and 3D pose simultaneously. Since we do not observe depth for inference or training directly, we hypothesize the depth of the features by sweeping with a plane through the 3D volume of potential joint locations. The regression forests are then combined with a pictorial structure framework, which is extended to 3D. The approach is evaluated on two challenging benchmarks where stateof-the-art performance is achieved.",

The recognised gestures are used to generate motion control commands to the low‐level DSP motion controller so that it can control the motion of the RoboChair according to the user's intention. Adaboost face detection algorithm and Camshift object tracking algorithm are combined in our system to achieve accurate face detection, tracking and gesture recognition in real time. It is intended to be used as a human‐friendly interface for elderly and disabled people to operate our intelligent wheelchair using their head gestures rather than their hands.Findings – This is an extremely useful system for the users who have restricted limb movements caused by some diseases such as Parkinson's disease and quadriplegics.Practical implicatio...",

            "abstract": "Humans use gestures in most communicative acts. How are these gestures initiated and performed? What kinds of communicative roles do they play and what kinds of meanings do they convey? How do listeners extract and understand these meanings? Will it be possible to build computerized communicating agents that can extract and understand the meanings and accordingly simulate and display expressive gestures on the computer in such a way that they can be effective conversational partners? All these questions are easy to ask, but far more difficult to answer. In the thesis we try to address these questions regarding the synthesis and acquisition of communicative gestures. \nOur approach to gesture is based on the principles of movement observation science, specifically Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) and its Effort and Shape components. LMA, developed in the dance community over the past seventy years, is an effective method for observing, describing, notating, and interpreting human movement to enhance communication and expression in everyday and professional life. Its Effort and Shape component provide us with a comprehensive and valuable set of parameters to characterize gesture formation. The computational model (the EMOTE system) we have built offers power and flexibility to procedurally synthesize gestures based on predefined key pose and time information plus Effort and Shape qualities. \nTo provide real quantitative foundations for a complete communicative gesture model, we have built a computational framework where the observable characteristics of gestures—not only key pose and timing but also the underlying motion qualities—can be extracted from live performance, either in 3D motion capture data or in 2D video data, and correlated with observations validated by LMA notators. Experiments of this sort have not been conducted before and should be of interest not only to the computer animation and computer vision community but would be a powerful and valuable methodological tool for creating personalized, communicating agents.",

        "abstract": "Our proposed music-to-dance framework, Bailando++, addresses the challenges of driving 3D characters to dance in a way that follows the constraints of choreography norms and maintains temporal coherency with different music genres. Bailando++ consists of two components: a choreographic memory that learns to summarize meaningful dancing units from 3D pose sequences, and an actor-critic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that composes these units into a fluent dance coherent to the music. In particular, to synchronize the diverse motion tempos and music beats, we introduce an actor-critic-based reinforcement learning scheme to the GPT with a novel beat-align reward function. Additionally, we consider learning human dance poses in the rotation domain to avoid body distortions incompatible with human morphology, and introduce a musical contextual encoding to allow the motion GPT to grasp longer-term patterns of music. Our experiments on the standard benchmark show that Bailando++ achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the added benefit of the unsupervised discovery of human-interpretable dancing-style poses in the choreographic memory.",

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we aim to generate long actions represented as sequences of skeletons. The generated sequences must demonstrate continuous, meaningful human actions, while maintaining coherence among body parts. Instead of generating skeletons sequentially following an autoregressive model, we propose a framework that generates the entire sequence altogether by transforming from a sequence of latent vectors sampled from a Gaussian process (GP). This framework, named Convolutional Sequence Generation Network (CSGN), jointly models structures in temporal and spatial dimensions. It captures the temporal structure at multiple scales through the GP prior and the temporal convolutions; and establishes the spatial connection between the latent vectors and the skeleton graphs via a novel graph refining scheme. It is noteworthy that CSGN allows bidirectional transforms between the latent and the observed spaces, thus enabling semantic manipulation of the action sequences in various forms. We conducted empirical studies on multiple datasets, including a set of high-quality dancing sequences collected by us. The results show that our framework can produce long action sequences that are coherent across time steps and among body parts.",

            "abstract": "Many complex decision making problems like scheduling in manufacturing systems, portfolio management in finance, admission control in communication networks etc., with clear and precise objectives, can be formulated as stochastic dynamic programming problems in which the objective of decision making is to maximize a single “overall” reward. In these formulations, finding an optimal decision policy involves computing a certain “value function” which assigns to each state the optimal reward one would obtain if the system was started from that state. This function then naturally prescribes the optimal policy, which is to take decisions that drive the system to states with maximum value. \nFor many practical problems, the computation of the exact value function is intractable, analytically and numerically, due to the enormous size of the state space. Therefore one has to resort to one of the following approximation methods to find a good sub-optimal policy: (1) Approximate the value function. (2) Restrict the search for a good policy to a smaller family of policies. \nIn this thesis, we propose and study actor-critic algorithms which combine the above two approaches with simulation to find the best policy among a parameterized class of policies. Actor-critic algorithms have two learning units: an actor and a critic. An actor is a decision maker with a tunable parameter. A critic is a function approximator. The critic tries to approximate the value function of the policy used by the actor, and the actor in turn tries to improve its policy based on the current approximation provided by the critic. Furthermore, the critic evolves on a faster time-scale than the actor. \nWe propose several variants of actor-critic algorithms. In all the variants, the critic uses Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation. Some of the variants are inspired by a new geometric interpretation of the formula for the gradient of the overall reward with respect to the actor parameters. This interpretation suggests a natural set of basis functions for the critic, determined by the family of policies parameterized by the actor's parameters. We concentrate on the average expected reward criterion but we also show how the algorithms can be modified for other objective criteria. We prove convergence of the algorithms for problems with general (finite, countable, or continuous) state and decision spaces. \nTo compute the rate of convergence (ROC) of our algorithms, we develop a general theory of the ROC of two-time-scale algorithms and we apply it to study our algorithms. In the process, we study the ROC of TD learning and compare it with related methods such as Least Squares TD (LSTD). We study the effect of the basis functions used for linear function approximation on the ROC of TD. We also show that the ROC of actor-critic algorithms does not depend on the actual basis functions used in the critic but depends only on the subspace spanned by them and study this dependence. \nFinally, we compare the performance of our algorithms with other algorithms that optimize over a parameterized family of policies. We show that when only the “natural” basis functions are used for the critic, the rate of convergence of the actor critic algorithms is the same as that of certain stochastic gradient descent algorithms. However, with appropriate additional basis functions for the critic, we show that our algorithms outperform the existing ones in terms of ROC.

Experimental results of generated dance sequences from various songs show how the proposed method generates human-like dancing move to a given music.

            "abstract": "The creation of improvised dancing choreographies is an important research field of cross-modal analysis. A key point of this task is how to effectively create and correlate music and dance with a probabilistic one-to-many mapping, which is essential to create realistic dances of various genres. To address this issue, we propose a GAN-based cross-modal association framework, DeepDance, which correlates two different modalities (dance motion and music) together, aiming at creating the desired dance sequence in terms of the input music. Its generator is to predictively produce the dance movements best-fit to current music piece by learning from examples. In another hand, its discriminator acts as an external evaluation from the audience and judges the whole performance. The generated dance movements and the corresponding input music are considered to be well-matched if the discriminator cannot distinguish the generated movements from the training samples according to the estimated probability. By adding motion consistency constraints in our loss function, the proposed framework is able to create long realistic dance sequences. To alleviate the problem of expensive and inefficient data collection, we propose an effective approach to create a large-scale dataset, YouTube-Dance3D, from open data source. Extensive experiments on currently available music-dance datasets and our YouTube-Dance3D dataset demonstrate that our approach effectively captures the correlation between music and dance and can be used to choreograph appropriate dance sequences.",

Most previous works conduct music-to-dance synthesis via directly music to human skeleton keypoints mapping. Meanwhile, human choreographers design dance motions from music in a two-stage manner: they firstly devise multiple choreographic dance units (CAUs), each with a series of dance motions, and then arrange the CAU sequence according to the rhythm, melody and emotion of the music. Inspired by these, we systematically study such two-stage choreography approach and construct a dataset to incorporate such choreography knowledge. Based on the constructed dataset, we design a two-stage music-to-dance synthesis framework ChoreoNet to imitate human choreography procedure. Our framework firstly devises a CAU prediction model to learn the mapping relationship between music and CAU sequences. Afterwards, we devise a spatial-temporal inpainting model to convert the CAU sequence into continuous dance motions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ChoreoNet outperforms baseline methods (0.622 in terms of CAU BLEU score and 1.59 in terms of user study score).",

In contrast to CNNs, they contain no inductive bias that prioritizes local interactions. This makes them expressive, but also computationally infeasible for long sequences, such as high-resolution images. We demonstrate how combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the expressivity of transformers enables them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution images. We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a context-rich vocabulary of image constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently model their composition within high-resolution images. Our approach is readily applied to conditional synthesis tasks, where both non-spatial information, such as object classes, and spatial information, such as segmentations, can control the generated image. In particular, we present the first results on semantically-guided synthesis of megapixel images with transformers. Project page at https://git.io/JLlvY.",

This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture, and associated advances in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.",

In order to remove the skill barriers for laymen, recent motion generation methods can directly generate human motions conditioned on natural languages. However, it remains challenging to achieve diverse and fine-grained motion generation with various text inputs. To address this problem, we propose MotionDiffuse, one of the first diffusion model-based text-driven motion generation frameworks, which demonstrates several desired properties over existing methods. 1) Probabilistic Mapping. Instead of a deterministic language-motion mapping, MotionDiffuse generates motions through a series of denoising steps in which variations are injected. 2) Realistic Synthesis. MotionDiffuse excels at modeling complicated data distribution and generating vivid motion sequences. 3) Multi-Level Manipulation. MotionDiffuse responds to fine-grained instructions on body parts, and arbitrary-length motion synthesis with time-varied text prompts. Our experiments show MotionDiffuse outperforms existing SoTA methods by convincing margins on text-driven motion generation and action-conditioned motion generation. A qualitative analysis further demonstrates MotionDiffuse's controllability for comprehensive motion generation.",

EDGE uses a transformer-based diffusion model paired with Jukebox, a strong music feature extractor, and confers powerful editing capabilities well-suited to dance, including joint-wise conditioning, and in-betweening. We introduce a new metric for physical plausibility, and evaluate dance quality generated by our method extensively through (1) multiple quantitative metrics on physical plausibility, beat alignment, and diversity benchmarks, and more importantly, (2) a large-scale user study, demonstrating a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.

To understand experience and the user experience that results from interacting with products, designers conduct situated research activities focused on the interactions between people and products, and the experience that results. This paper attempts to clarify experience in interactive systems. We characterize current approaches to experience from a number of disciplines, and present a framework for designing experience for interactive system. We show how the framework can be applied by members of a multidisciplinary team to understand and generate the kinds of interactions and experiences new product and system designs might offer.",

        "title": "Synthesis and acquisition of laban movement analysis qualitative parameters for communicative gestures",
        "abstract": "Humans use gestures in most communicative acts. How are these gestures initiated and performed? What kinds of communicative roles do they play and what kinds of meanings do they convey? How do listeners extract and understand these meanings? Will it be possible to build computerized communicating agents that can extract and understand the meanings and accordingly simulate and display expressive gestures on the computer in such a way that they can be effective conversational partners? All these questions are easy to ask, but far more difficult to answer. In the thesis we try to address these questions regarding the synthesis and acquisition of communicative gestures. \nOur approach to gesture is based on the principles of movement observation science, specifically Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) and its Effort and Shape components. LMA, developed in the dance community over the past seventy years, is an effective method for observing, describing, notating, and interpreting human movement to enhance communication and expression in everyday and professional life. Its Effort and Shape component provide us with a comprehensive and valuable set of parameters to characterize gesture formation. The computational model (the EMOTE system) we have built offers power and flexibility to procedurally synthesize gestures based on predefined key pose and time information plus Effort and Shape qualities. \nTo provide real quantitative foundations for a complete communicative gesture model, we have built a computational framework where the observable characteristics of gestures—not only key pose and timing but also the underlying motion qualities—can be extracted from live performance, either in 3D motion capture data or in 2D video data, and correlated with observations validated by LMA notators. Experiments of this sort have not been conducted before and should be of interest not only to the computer animation and computer vision community but would be a powerful and valuable methodological tool for creating personalized, communicating agents.",

For example, control algorithms allow the simulated humans to maintain balance while moving their arms, to run or bicycle at a variety of speeds, and to perform two vaults. For each simulation, we compare the computed motion to that of humans performing similar maneuvers. We perform the comparison both qualitatively through real and simulated video images and quantitatively through simulated and biomechanical data.",

Dogs recognize dominance and submission, stand corrected by their superiors, demonstrate consistent personalities, and so forth. On the other hand, only humans communicate using language, and carry on conversations with one another. And the skills of conversation have developed in humans in such a way as to exploit all of the unique affordances of the human body. We make complex representational gestures with our prehensile hands, gaze away and towards one another out of the corners of our centrally-set eyes, and use the pitch and melody of our flexible voices to emphasize and clarify what we are saying. Perhaps because conversation is so defining of humanness and human interaction, the metaphor of face-to-face conversation has been applied to human-computer interface design for quite some time. One of the early arguments for the utility of this metaphor gave a list of features of face-to-face conversation that could be fruitfully applied to human-computer interaction, including mixed initiative, non-verbal communication, sense of presence, rules for transfer of control ([9]). However, although these features have gained widespread recognition, human – computer conversation has only very recently become more than a metaphor.

Although the performance of a network clearly depends on its structure, the procedure for selecting the optimal structure has not been thoroughly investigated, it is well known that the number of hidden units must be sufficient to discriminate each observation correctly. A large number of hidden units requires extensive computational time for training and often times prediction results may not be as accurate as expected. This study attempts to apply the principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the structure of a multilayered neural network for time series forecasting problems. The main focus is to determine the number of hidden units for a multilayered feedforward network. One empirical experiment with sunspot data is used to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.",

However, people whose deception attempts were more easily detected by others also had their underlying affects read more easily. Speakers whose lies were seen more readily by men also had their lies seen more readily by women, and observers better able to see the underlying affects of women were better able to see the underlying affects of men. Skill at lying successfully was unrelated to skill at catching others in their lies. A histrionic strategy (hamming) was very effective in deceiving others, and this strategy was employed more by more Machiavellian people, who also tended to get caught less often in their lies.

Such an understanding of the physical correlates of local minima suggests sensible ways of choosing the weights from which the training process is initiated.

            "abstract": "Gesture-based interfaces, in which the user specifies commands by simple freehand drawings, offer an alternative to traditional keyboard, menu, and direct manipulation interfaces. The ability to specify objects, an operation, and additional parameters with a single intuitive gesture makes gesture-based systems appealing to both novice and experienced users. \nUnfortunately, the difficulty in building gesture-based systems has prevented such systems from being adequately explored. This dissertation presents work that attempts to alleviate two of the major difficulties: the construction of gesture classifiers and the integration of gestures into direct-manipulation interfaces. Three example gesture-based applications were built to demonstrate this work. \nGesture-based systems require classifiers to distinguish between the possible gestures a user may enter. In the past, classifiers have often been hand-coded for each new application, making them difficult to build, change, and maintain. This dissertation applies elementary statistical pattern recognition techniques to produce gesture classifiers that are trained by example, greatly simplifying their creation and maintenance. Both single-path gestures (drawn with a mouse or stylus) and multiple-path gestures (consisting of the simultaneous paths of multiple fingers) may be classified. On a 1 MIPS workstation, a 30-class single-path recognizer takes 175 milliseconds to train (once the examples have been entered), and classification takes 9 milliseconds, typically achieving 97% accuracy. A method for classifying a gesture as soon as it is unambiguous is also presented. \nThis dissertation also describes GRANDMA, a toolkit for building gesture-based applications based on Smalltalk's Model/View/Controller paradigm. Using GRANDMA, one associates sets of gesture classes with individual views or entire view classes. A gesture class can be specified at runtime by entering a few examples of the class, typically 15. The semantics of a gesture class can be specified at runtime via a simple programming interface. Besides allowing for easy experimentation with gesture-based interfaces, GRANDMA sports a novel input architecture, capable of supporting multiple input devices and multi-threaded dialogues. The notion of virtual tools and semantic feedback are shown to arise naturally from GRANDMA's approach.",

The estimation of model parameters in consecutive images is done by applying a Kalman filter. Experimental results are shown for synthetic as well as for real image data.",

All three employed a modified referential communication task in which subjects (speakers) were videotaped as they described a stimulus to a partner, who then tried to select it from a set of similar stimuli. Half of the dyads communicated face-to-face; the remainder were in different rooms and communicated over an intercom. The videotaped descriptions were presented to the new subjects (listeners), who tried to select the stimulus described. Half of these listeners both saw and heard the videotape; the remainder only heard the soundtrack. The three experiments differed in the type of stimulus the speakers described: abstract graphic designs, novel synthesized sounds, or samples of tea. Communication accuracy (i.e., the rate at which listeners selected the correct stimulus) was better than chance in all three experiments, but in none was accuracy enhanced by allowing the listener to see the speaker′s gestures. The results bring into question the assumption that the communication of semantic information is a primary function of conversational hand gestures.",

Participants were grouped into dancers and physically active nondancers (ages 60-70 and 70-80 for both groups). Physical activity, body composition (body-mass index, skinfold thickness, waist-to-hip ratio), functional ability (6-min walk distance, 6-m walk time, 8-ft up-and-go time, lower body flexibility, shoulder flexibility), and static balance were measured. Younger dancers and physically active nondancers had similar 6-min walk distance, 6-m walk time, and 8-ft up-and-go time results; however, while older dancers performed similarly to younger dancers, older physically active nondancers performed poorer than their younger counterparts (p < .05). Body composition and static balance were the same for all groups. Regular physical activity can maintain body composition and postural stability with advancing age; however, Scottish country dance can delay the effects of aging on locomotion-related functional abilities.",

Thirty-two healthy elderly subjects (60 - 76 years) were assigned to one of four groups: aerobic training, mental training, combined aerobic and mental training and a control group. All subjects took two cognitive tests and an incremental exercise test before and after the training period. The intensity of exercise was individualized at the heart rate corresponding to the ventilatory threshold of each subject. After two months, the control group showed no alteration in physiological and cognitive variables. After the training period, the results showed a significant improvement in VO(2)max (F = 4.45, DF = 1, p < 0.05) of 12 % and 11 % in aerobic training and combined aerobic and mental training groups, respectively. Logical memory (F = 4.31, DF = 1, p < 0.05), as well as paired associates learning scores (F = 5.47, DF = 1, p < 0.05) and memory quotient (F = 6.52, DF = 1, p < 0.01) were significantly improved in the three trained groups. The mean difference in memory quotient between pre and post training was significantly higher in the combined aerobic and mental training group compared to aerobic training or mental training groups (F = 11.60, DF = 3, p < 0.001). We conclude that the specific aerobic training and mental training used in this study could induce the same degree of improvement in cognitive function and that combined training seemed to lead to greater effects than either technique alone.",

Blood samples were collected in one-third of the participants (randomly selected, n = 981). Test-retest reliability of the IFIS was studied in a separate sample of 277 adolescents. Physical fitness-cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), muscular fitness (MF), speed-agility (SP-AG), flexibility and overall fitness-was self-reported using 5-point Likert-scale questions (1 = very poor, 5 = very good) and measured using standard field-based tests. The CVD risk factors measured included total/central adiposity indices and mean arterial pressure, total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin resistance (HOMA) and C-reactive protein.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of covariance showed that adolescents reporting better fitness had higher measured fitness levels for all the variables studied (all P < 0.001), regardless of gender, age and weight status. Adolescents reporting very good overall fitness, CRF and SP-AG had a healthier cardiovascular profile in eight out of nine CVD risk factors studied. Perfect agreement (same test-retest answer) was observed in 65% of the adolescents and perfect-acceptable agreement (same answer or ±1) in 97% of the adolescents.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n(i) The IFIS is able to correctly rank adolescents according to their measured physical fitness levels; (ii) adolescents reporting a good/very good overall fitness, CRF or SP-AG have a more favorable cardiovascular profile; and (iii) The IFIS is reliable in adolescents.",

        "abstract": "Background: Dance is an embodied activity and, when applied therapeutically, can have several specific and unspecific health benefits. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of dance movement therapy1(DMT) and dance interventions for psychological health outcomes. Research in this area grew considerably from 1.3 detected studies/year in 1996–2012 to 6.8 detected studies/year in 2012–2018. Method: We synthesized 41 controlled intervention studies (N = 2,374; from 01/2012 to 03/2018), 21 from DMT, and 20 from dance, investigating the outcome clusters of quality of life, clinical outcomes (with sub-analyses of depression and anxiety), interpersonal skills, cognitive skills, and (psycho-)motor skills. We included recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in areas such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, elderly patients, oncology, neurology, chronic heart failure, and cardiovascular disease, including follow-up data in eight studies. Results: Analyses yielded a medium overall effect (d2 = 0.60), with high heterogeneity of results (I2 = 72.62%). Sorted by outcome clusters, the effects were medium to large (d = 0.53 to d = 0.85). All effects, except the one for (psycho-)motor skills, showed high inconsistency of results. Sensitivity analyses revealed that type of intervention (DMT or dance) was a significant moderator of results. In the DMT cluster, the overall medium effect was small, significant, and homogeneous/consistent (d = 0.30, p < 0.001, I2 = 3.47). In the dance intervention cluster, the overall medium effect was large, significant, yet heterogeneous/non-consistent (d = 0.81, p < 0.001, I2 = 77.96). Results suggest that DMT decreases depression and anxiety and increases quality of life and interpersonal and cognitive skills, whereas dance interventions increase (psycho-)motor skills. Larger effect sizes resulted from observational measures, possibly indicating bias. Follow-up data showed that on 22 weeks after the intervention, most effects remained stable or slightly increased. Discussion: Consistent effects of DMT coincide with findings from former meta-analyses. Most dance intervention studies came from preventive contexts and most DMT studies came from institutional healthcare contexts with more severely impaired clinical patients, where we found smaller effects, yet with higher clinical relevance. Methodological shortcomings of many included studies and heterogeneity of outcome measures limit results. Initial findings on long-term effects are promising.",

            "abstract": "s and other grey literature have been shown to be sources of approximately 10% of the studies referenced in Cochrane reviews (Mallett 2002). Over one-half of trials reported in conference abstract never reach full publication, and those that are eventually published in full have been shown to be systematically different than those that are never published in full (Scherer 2003). In addition, grey literature in general has been found to be more likely than health care journals to contain ‘negative’ reports (McAuley 2000). Thus, failure to identify trials reported in conference proceedings might affect the results or threaten the validity of a systematic review. Authors who wish to handsearch journals or conference proceedings to identify reports of studies for their review should first consult with the editorial based of their CRG. The CRG’s Trials Search Coordinator/Review Group Coordinator can determine whether the journal or conference proceedings has already been searched, and, if it has not, the Coordinator can register the search on the Master List and provide training in handsearching. Training material is available on the US Cochrane Center web site (http://www.cochrane.us/hsmain.htm) All correspondence regarding the initiation of a journal search, progress of a journal search, status of a search etc needs to be between staff at the US Cochrane Center and the Trials Search Coordinator/Review Group Coordinator. 5.1.3 Checking reference lists Authors should check the reference lists of articles obtained (including those from previously published systematic reviews) to identify relevant reports. The process of following up references from one article to another is generally an efficient means of identifying studies for possible inclusion in a review. Because investigators may selectively cite studies with positive results (Gotzsche 1987; Ravnskov 1992), reference lists should never be used as a sole approach to identifying reports for a review, but rather as an adjunct to other approaches. 5.1.4 Checking other reviews Some of the most convenient and obvious sources of references to potentially relevant studies are existing reviews. Copies of previously published reviews on the topic of interest should be obtained and checked for references to the original studies. As well as the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, The Cochrane Library includes the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) a database produced by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination in York, UK, that provides information on previously published reviews of the effects of healthcare. MEDLINE, EMBASE and other bibliographic databases can also be used to identify review articles. In MEDLINE, the most appropriate review articles would be indexed under the Publication Type terms META-ANALYSIS and REVIEW, ACADEMIC. Search strategies have been developed to enhance identification of these types of publication (Boynton 1998). 5.1.5 Print versions of electronic databases While MEDLINE and EMBASE include citations from 1966 and 1974 to the present, respectively, Index Medicus and Excerpta Medica, the print versions of these databases, include citations from 1879 and 1948, respectively. Searching the earlier printed subject indexes may be worthwhile, especially if there is reason to believe that there were early studies of the intervention being reviewed. Science Citation Index is the print version of SciSearch (see Section 5.1.1.3) and is used for the same general purpose, i.e. for listings of where a published article was subsequently cited. Science Citation Index is more comprehensive than SciSearch, which began in 1974.",

Dancing is increasingly used as an intervention because it combines many diverse features making it a promising neuroplasticity-inducing tool. We here investigated the effects of a 6-month dance class (1 h/week) on a group of healthy elderly individuals compared to a matched control group (CG). We performed a broad assessment covering cognition, intelligence, attention, reaction time, motor, tactile, and postural performance, as well as subjective well-being and cardio-respiratory performance. After 6 months, in the CG no changes, or further degradation of performance was found. In the dance group, beneficial effects were found for dance-related parameters such as posture and reaction times, but also for cognitive, tactile, motor performance, and subjective well-being. These effects developed without alterations in the cardio-respiratory performance. Correlation of baseline performance with the improvement following intervention revealed that those individuals, who benefitted most from the intervention, were those who showed the lowest performance prior to the intervention. Our findings corroborate previous observations that dancing evokes widespread positive effects. The pre-post design used in the present study implies that the efficacy of dance is most likely not based on a selection bias of particularly gifted individuals.

This research was conducted with a total of 60 students, including 30 students as control and 30 students as working group. 33-item self-confidence scale developed by Akin (2007) was applied to both control and working group. Latin dance training was carried out once a week (2 hours) for a total of 24 hours, in 12 weeks. SPSS 16.0 was used for the evaluation of the data obtained in the study. Percetage, frequency, Paired Sample and Independent t-test were used for the analysis of the data. When post-test scores of self-confidence were evaluated, score of working group was found to be statistically significant compared to control group. According to the result of the research, it might be said that 12-week Latin dance training had increased the self confidence of the participants.",

Design A multicentre non-randomized controlled trial with a treatment and a control condition conducted in South Africa (4 sites). Methods 125 children aged 7 to 13 years were assigned either to the treatment condition receiving creative arts in psychotherapy or a control condition with a low-level supportive programme without treatment. Attrition rates were 63.4% and in total 47 children completed the programme and questionnaires assessing posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth and behaviour problems both at baseline and follow-up; 23 in the treatment group and 24 in the control group. Adjusted mean differences were analysed using ANCOVA with bootstrapping. Results Results showed that both hyperarousal symptoms (d = 0.61) and avoidance symptoms (d = 0.41) decreased more in the treatment group compared to the control group. There was no significant effect of the intervention found for reported levels of behavioural problems and posttraumatic growth. Conclusion In spite of severe challenges implementing and executing this pioneering study in underprivileged areas of South Africa, support was found for creative arts in psychotherapy reducing hyperarousal and avoidance symptoms, but not for other symptoms. Valuable lessons were learned on feasibility of implementing this intervention in a developing context.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for creating expressive aerial robots through an algorithmic procedure for creating variable motion under given task constraints. This work is informed by the close study of the Laban/Bartenieff movement system, and movement observation from this discipline will provide important analysis of the method, offering descriptive words and fitting contexts—a choreographic frame—for the motion styles produced. User studies that use utilize this qualitative analysis then validate that the method can be used to generate appropriate motion in in-home contexts. The accuracy of an individual descriptive word for the developed motion is up to 77% and context accuracy is up to 83%. A capacity for state discernment from motion profile is essential in the context of projects working toward developing in-home robots.",

        "title": "Dancing as searching with Deleuze – a study of what students in physical education teacher education express and experience in creative dance lessons",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Physical education (PE), and specifically the teaching area of dance, has been identified as an important pedagogical setting within which young people develop creativity. Creativity is thus an important aspect of schooling. Several studies have suggested however, that dance is seldom taught in PE in ways that acknowledge creative aspects of movement learning, and that students in physical education teacher education (PETE) receive insufficient training in the area of dance. Very little research has been conducted specifically on how teachers and PETE students understand the subject tradition of creative dance. The aim of this paper is to create insights into what PETE students express and experience in creative dance lessons where we specifically explore a pedagogy based on imitation. To address this aim, empirical material was generated through observations and logbooks during a pedagogical sequence of creative dance at a Swedish PETE institution. Deleuzian concepts of palpation and experimentation were used to guide our analysis. The results of this study show alternative ways of understanding what can happen when students participate in creative dance lessons. Our findings contribute to researchers’ and teacher educators’ understandings of students’ experiences of working with spaces of creativity in PETE, and how these experiences can be used in teaching of creative dance.",

Methods: The study reports on the implementation of a 10-lesson pedagogical sequence. Data were generated using observations, interviews, and student diaries with one grade 9 class (26 students aged approximately 15 years) as they developed juggling capabilities. Data were analyzed using the notion of corporeal thresholds. Results: Results show that (a) a “throw–throw–catch–catch” pattern emerged as a corporeal threshold for juggling within the sequence; (b) most learners had crossed the threshold at the outset and were able to experiment with different forms of juggling during the sequence; (c) some students crossed the threshold during the sequence. These students experienced liminal phases, characterized by frustration and an initial feeling that they were juggling in the “wrong” way; and (d) some learners became stuck, pretended to know what to do, and did not cross the threshold during the 10 lessons. Discussion/Conclusion: Three issues related to the threshold approach are discussed: student identity and group membership, the process of learning, and the emotional dimensions of movement learning. This study is concluded with reflections on the implications of the results for scholarship.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background There is a global consensus that stimulating and fostering children’s creativity in education is crucial. Addressing creativity has become an imperative in educational policies and in school curricula internationally. School-based physical education (PE), and specifically the teaching area of dance, has been identified as an important pedagogical setting within which to develop creativity. Existing studies have suggested, however, that dance is seldom taught in PE in ways that acknowledge creative aspects of movement learning. Scholars have claimed that teaching pre-arranged dances with predetermined movement outcomes dominate dance teaching in PE. Furthermore, studies have asserted that the overarching regulative principles of PE and PETE that privilege sport skills and physical exercise hinder creative movement learning. Still, dance teaching is frequently seen as part of expressive dance teaching in PE and PETE and is regarded as holding potential in the area of education for creativity. Little scholarly attention has been given to how teacher educators approach creative aspects in dance teaching. Purpose This article aims to create insights into how PETE teacher educators understand and work with creative aspects of dance in their educational practice. Method and theory To address our aim, we investigate how teacher educators describe their teaching of creative aspects of dance. To do this, empirical material was generated through qualitative interviews with PE teacher educators from each of the PETE institutions in Sweden. The theoretical concepts of smooth and striated spaces and experimentation by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari were used to guide the analysis of how the PETE educators described their teaching of creative aspects of dance. Deleuze and Guattari developed a framework that concerned questions of creativity and newness. Despite this conceptual framework having not yet been used in dance education in PE and PETE, their writing fits well when analysing questions of creativity in an educational context. Findings We identified three major themes relating to creativity in the empirical material: (a) creative aspects of expressive dance; (b) challenges that teacher educators face when introducing movement exploration in expressive dance to their students, and; (c) the teacher educators’ pedagogical work with students. Discussion The results of this study show that teaching expressive dance can take teaching in PE and PETE in new directions. The results provide insights into alternative ways of teaching in these educational settings that can counter the dominant ways of teaching dance. Results suggest that teacher educators operate in various striated spaces that are shaped by expectations and conventions. In such spaces, the educators aim to create momentary passages of smoothening that open up for experimentation and the development of students’ creativity. The results also suggest that expressive dance in PE and PETE emphasizes creative movement learning through which students learn to operate within new and unpredictable situations.",

        "abstract": "What expectations exist in the minds of dancers when interacting with a generative machine learning model? During two workshop events, experienced dancers explore these expectations through improvisation and role-play, embodying an imagined AI-dancer. The dancers explored how intuited flow, shared images, and the concept of a human replica might work in their imagined AI-human interaction. Our findings challenge existing assumptions about what is desired from generative models of dance, such as expectations of realism, and how such systems should be evaluated. We further advocate that such models should celebrate non-human artefacts, focus on the potential for serendipitous moments of discovery, and that dance practitioners should be included in their development. Our concrete suggestions show how our findings can be adapted into the development of improved generative and interactive machine learning models for dancers’ creative practice.",

            "abstract": "Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary difficulty arises due to insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust value functions. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for its own sake rather than to directly solve problems. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse, delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process, and (2) the classic ATARI game `Montezuma's Revenge'.",

In this reflexive commentary, we look back at some of the unspoken assumptions that informed how we wrote our 2006 paper. We connect some of these un-identified assumptions, and developments in the method over the years, with some conceptual mismatches and confusions we see in published TA studies. In order to facilitate better TA practice, we reflect on how our thinking has evolved – and in some cases sedimented – since the publication of our 2006 paper, and clarify and revise some of the ways we phrased or conceptualised TA, and the elements of, and processes around, a method we now prefer to call reflexive TA.",

Enabling real-time movement improvisation requires equipping computers with strategies for learning and understanding movement. Most existing research focuses on gesture classification, which does not facilitate the learning of new gestures, thereby limiting the creative capacity of computers. In this paper, we explore how to develop a gesture clustering pipeline that facilitates reasoning about arbitrary novel movements in real-time. We describe the implementation of this pipeline within the context of LuminAI, a system in which humans can collaboratively improvise movements together with an AI agent. A preliminary evaluation indicates that our pipeline is capable of efficiently clustering similar gestures together, but further work is necessary to fully assess the pipeline's ability to meaningfully cluster complex movements.",

We contribute a survey of 113 research papers that present and evaluate CSTs, and we offer recommendations for future CST evaluation. We center our discussion around six major points that researchers might consider: 1) Clearly define the goal of the CST; 2) link to theory to further understanding of usage of CSTs; 3) recruit domain experts, if applicable and feasible; 4) consider longitudinal, in-situ studies; 5) distinguish and decide whether to evaluate usability or creativity; and 6) as a community, help develop a toolbox for CST evaluation.",

It is particularly challenging for computers to judge the creativity of inputs and responses in these open-ended domains. LuminAI is an improvisational dance installation where an artiﬁcially intelligent agent dances with a user. In this paper, we enable the agent to judge the creativity of dance gestures through the development of creativity metrics, including the novelty , value , and surprise of a gesture. We then use these metrics to implement a lead-and-follow dynamic: when the user is performing less cre-atively, the agent tries to lead by performing more cre-atively. A user study is performed to compare the original and lead-and-follow systems, with results showing users found the lead-and-follow system’s gestures lower in quality than the original, more surprising than the original, and found the original system more engaging and inﬂuential on their actions.",

The proposed AIST++ dataset contains 5.2 hours of 3D dance motion in 1408 sequences, covering 10 dance genres with multi-view videos with known camera poses—the largest dataset of this kind to our knowledge. We show that naively applying sequence models such as transformers to this dataset for the task of music conditioned 3D motion generation does not produce satisfactory 3D motion that is well correlated with the input music. We overcome these shortcomings by introducing key changes in its architecture design and supervision: FACT model involves a deep cross-modal transformer block with full-attention that is trained to predict N future motions. We empirically show that these changes are key factors in generating long sequences of realistic dance motion that are well-attuned to the input music. We conduct extensive experiments on AIST++ with user studies, where our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

One limitation has been the focus on symbolic music, an imperfect representation for musical gesture, another has been the lack of interactive explorations of co-creative musical systems with modern machine learning techniques. In this work these limitations are addressed through the study of a co-creative interactive music system that applies generative AI to gestures on an electronic music controller, not to creating traditional musical notes. The controller features eight rotational controls with visual feedback and is typical of interfaces used for electronic music performance and production. The sound and interaction design of the system suggest new techniques for adopting co-creation in generative music systems and a discussion of live performances experiences put these techniques into practical context.",

Most previous studies made use of videos of actors or dancers portraying emotions through choreography. The current study applies emotion induction techniques and free movement in order to examine the recognition of emotional content from dance. Observers (N = 30) watched a set of silent videos showing depersonalized avatars of dancers moving to an emotionally neutral musical stimulus after emotions of either sadness or happiness had been induced. Each of the video clips consisted of two dance performances which were presented side-by-side and were played simultaneously; one of a dancer in the happy condition and one of the same individual in the sad condition. After every film clip, the observers were asked to make forced-choices concerning the emotional state of the dancer. Results revealed that observers were able to identify the emotional state of the dancers with a high degree of accuracy. Moreover, emotions were more often recognized for female dancers than for their male counterparts. In addition, the results of eye tracking measurements unveiled that observers primarily focus on movements of the chest when decoding emotional information from dance movement. The findings of our study show that not merely portrayed emotions, but also induced emotions can be successfully recognized from free dance movement.",

            "abstract": "Models of gaze allocation in complex scenes are derived mainly from studies of static picture viewing. The dominant framework to emerge has been image salience, where properties of the stimulus play a crucial role in guiding the eyes. However, salience-based schemes are poor at accounting for many aspects of picture viewing and can fail dramatically in the context of natural task performance. These failures have led to the development of new models of gaze allocation in scene viewing that address a number of these issues. However, models based on the picture-viewing paradigm are unlikely to generalize to a broader range of experimental contexts, because the stimulus context is limited, and the dynamic, task-driven nature of vision is not represented. We argue that there is a need to move away from this class of model and find the principles that govern gaze allocation in a broader range of settings. We outline the major limitations of salience-based selection schemes and highlight what we have learned from studies of gaze allocation in natural vision. Clear principles of selection are found across many instances of natural vision and these are not the principles that might be expected from picture-viewing studies. We discuss the emerging theoretical framework for gaze allocation on the basis of reward maximization and uncertainty reduction.",

The female advantage in emotion recognition becomes even more apparent under conditions of rapid stimulus presentation. Affective priming paradigms have been developed to examine empirically whether facial emotion stimuli presented outside of conscious awareness color our impressions. It was observed that masked emotional facial expression has an affect congruent influence on subsequent judgments of neutral stimuli. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of gender on affective priming based on negative and positive facial expression. In our priming experiment sad, happy, neutral, or no facial expression was briefly presented (for 33 ms) and masked by neutral faces which had to be evaluated. 81 young healthy volunteers (53 women) participated in the study. Subjects had no subjective awareness of emotional primes. Women did not differ from men with regard to age, education, intelligence, trait anxiety, or depressivity. In the whole sample, happy but not sad facial expression elicited valence congruent affective priming. Between-group analyses revealed that women manifested greater affective priming due to happy faces than men. Women seem to have a greater ability to perceive and respond to positive facial emotion at an automatic processing level compared to men. High perceptual sensitivity to minimal social-affective signals may contribute to women's advantage in understanding other persons' emotional states.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo test the hypothesis that rapid and accurate performance of the proficient observer in mammogram interpretation involves a shift in the mechanism of image perception from a relatively slow search-to-find mode to a relatively fast holistic mode.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval, and participant informed consent was obtained; patient informed consent was not required. The eye positions of three full-time mammographers, one attending radiologist, two mammography fellows, and three radiology residents were recorded during the interpretation of 20 normal and 20 subtly abnormal mammograms. The search time required to first locate a cancer, as well as the initial eye scan path, was determined and compared with diagnostic performance as measured with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median time for all observers to fixate a cancer, regardless of the decision outcome, was 1.13 seconds, with a range of 0.68 second to 3.06 seconds. Even though most of the lesions were fixated, recognition of them as cancerous ranged from 85% (17 of 20) to 10% (two of 20), with corresponding areas under the ROC curve of 0.87-0.40. The ROC index of detectability, d(a), was linearly related to the time to first fixate a cancer with a correlation (r(2)) of 0.81.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe rapid initial fixation of a true abnormality is evidence for a global perceptual process capable of analyzing the visual input of the entire retinal image and pinpointing the spatial location of an abnormality. It appears to be more highly developed in the most proficient observers, replacing the less efficient initial search-to-find strategies.",

Results, which indicate a female advantage at FEP, are consistent with predictions derived from an integrated neurobehavioral/social constructivist model. These findings suggest a need for research examining both neurological maturation and socialization as important factors in the development of sex differences in FEP and related skills. Possible directions for future study are discussed, with emphasis on the need to integrate the infant literature with research focused on older children and adults.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThis study examined the effects of age and two novel factors (intensity and emotion category) on healthy children's developing emotion-processing from 4 to 15 years using two matching paradigms.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn explicit emotion-matching task was employed in which children matched the emotion of a target individual, and an implicit task whereby participants ignored the emotive facial stimulus and matched identity. Four intensities (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for each of five emotion categories (sad, anger, happy, fear, and disgust) were included and provided a novel avenue of emotion-processing exploration.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIncreasing age significantly improved children's performance on both tasks, particularly for fear and disgust. Age was not associated with more subtle processing (i.e., lower intensity of expression). When explicitly matching emotion expressions, increasing intensity was associated with improved performance. When matching identities (implicit emotion-matching), emotion category and intensity influenced task performance. Sex effects were minimal.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn children, age, facial expression intensity and emotion category are important for predicting accuracy on emotion-processing tasks. Emotion category and expression intensity differentially affect performance on explicit and implicit emotion-processing tasks.",

It lays out the tenets of painting as he saw them and makes the case for non-objective artistic forms. Brilliant as a philosophical treatise and as emphatic as an avant-grade tract, \"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\" provides the theoretical underpinnings to the Expressionist movement in art. While Michael Sadler's masterful translation has been available since its original publication in 1914, under the title \"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\", unknown until now is the significant correspondence between the translator and the artist, who closely followed the progress of his book's transformation into English, and who offered numerous insights and explanations into its meaning. Housed in the archives of Tate, these and other unpublished documents are appended to Kandinsky's text to provide the first comprehensively annotated edition of this seminal work. Included in this volume, essential for any student of modernism, and certain to supersede any previous edition, are the letters between Kandinsky and Sadler, and prose poems by Kandinsky relating to the period in which the book was written. More than a revised edition, this publication constitutes a major event, as the first full account of a remarkable literary collaboration and a crucial intellectual adventure.",

We use a theory of movement observation (Laban Movement Analysis) to describe movement styles as points in a multi-dimensional perceptual space. We cast the task of learning to synthesize desired movement styles as a regression problem: sequences generated via space-time interpolation of motion capture data are used to learn a nonlinear mapping between animation parameters and movement styles in perceptual space. We demonstrate that the learned model can apply a variety of motion styles to pre-recorded motion sequences and it can extrapolate styles not originally included in the training data.",

This paper provides automated methods for identifying logically similar motions in a data set and using them to build a continuous and intuitively parameterized space of motions. To find logically similar motions that are numerically dissimilar, our search method employs a novel distance metric to find \"close\" motions and then uses them as intermediaries to find more distant motions. Search queries are answered at interactive speeds through a precomputation that compactly represents all possibly similar motion segments. Once a set of related motions has been extracted, we automatically register them and apply blending techniques to create a continuous space of motions. Given a function that defines relevant motion parameters, we present a method for extracting motions from this space that accurately possess new parameters requested by the user. Our algorithm extends previous work by explicitly constraining blend weights to reasonable values and having a run-time cost that is nearly independent of the number of example motions. We present experimental results on a test data set of 37,000 frames, or about ten minutes of motion sampled at 60 Hz.",

The algorithm to be developed is essentially identical to one presented by Vintsyuk [1] and later by Bridle and Brown [2] ; but the notation and the presentation have been clarified. The derivation used for optimally time synchronizing a test pattern, consisting of a sequence of connected words, is straightforward and simple in comparison with other approaches decomposing the pattern matching problem into several levels. The approach presented relies basically on parameterizing the time warping path by a single index and on exploiting certain path constraints both in the word interior and at the word boundaries. The resulting algorithm turns out to be significantly more efficient than those proposed by Sakoe [3] as well as Myers and Rabiner [4], while providing the same accuracy in estimating the best possible matching string. Its most important feature is that the computational expenditure per word is independent of the number of words in the input string. Thus, it is well suited for recognizing comparatively long word sequences and for real-time operation. Furthermore, there is no need to specify the maximum number of words in the input string. The practical implementation of the algorithm is discussed; it requires no heuristic rules and no overhead. The algorithm can be modified to deal with syntactic constraints in terms of a finite state syntax.",

        "title": "Creative Dance in the Education Curriculum: Justifying the Unambiguous",
        "abstract": "The inclusion of creative dance in the education curriculum has been variously justified in terms of its value as art, as movement, as therapy, and as a component of an integrated curriculum. Although creative dance is currently justified in different curricula for contra- dictory and ambivalent reasons, there is a need for an unambiguous inclusion of creative dance as a legitimate art form in the curriculum. I evaluate the various justifications for creative dance as movement, therapy, integration, and art and examine how these thwart or do not thwart the need for an unambiguous inclusion of creative dance as an art form. Pour justifier l’integration de la danse creative dans les programmes scolaires, on invoque sa valeur comme art, comme mouvement et comme therapie, ou encore sa place au sein d’un programme integre. Il faut que la danse creative soit incluse d’une maniere non ambigue dans les programmes scolaires en tant qu’expression artistique ayant droit de cite. Actuellement, on justifie l’integration de la danse creative dans divers programmes scolaires en faisant appel a des raisons contradictoires et ambivalentes. L’auteure evalue les divers moyens de justifier la danse creative comme mouvement, therapie, integration et art, et analyse comment ces diverses justifications vont ou non a l’encontre du besoin d’inclure sans ambiguite dans les programmes scolaires la danse creative comme ex- pression artistique.",

In the course of attacking these theories the author criticizes various psychological theories of art, offers a new theory of magic, and reinterprets Plato's so-called \"attack on art,\" showing that it has been entirely misunderstood. Finally, he draws important inferences concerning the position of art in human society.",

            "abstract": "Of all the forms of human endeavor that may be found represented in an educational curriculum, the place and status of dance is perhaps the most ambiguous. On the face of it, dance as an art form requires much the same sort of educational spirit and approach as painting or music, but in most schools where it is taught, it is taught as a branch of physical activity by teachers of physical education. The reasons for this, of course, are neither unclear nor inconsiderable-both dance and sport concern the practice of physical skill, and both dancer and sportsman require a sophisticated level of physical training. I shall argue in this paper, however, that given the way that the current professional preparation of physical educationalists encourages them to view the notion of skill teaching, consequences for the teaching of dance in schools of its association with physical education can only be unfortunate. The present paper, then, may be understood as an essay in the philosophy of education rather than as a discussion of aesthetics or dance.",
