        "title": "Emotion Recognition in Contemporary Dance Performances Using Laban Movement Analysis",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for emotion recognition in contemporary dance by improving existing Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) feature descriptors and introducing robust, novel descriptors that capture both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the movement. Our approach extracts expressive characteristics from 3D keypoints data of professional dancers performing contemporary dance under various emotional states, and trains multiple classifiers, including Random Forests and Support Vector Machines. Additionally, we provide in-depth explanation of features and their impact on model predictions using explainable machine learning methods. Overall, our study improves emotion recognition in contemporary dance and offers promising applications in performance analysis, dance training, and human--computer interaction, with a highest accuracy of 96.85\\%.",

            "abstract": "Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent \"High Throughput\" methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.",

Our system is a multi-component workflow which extracts and collects dance movement images, processes and quantifies human pose skeletons, and computes attributes pertaining to dance movement that adhere to the movement methodologies based on \"The Dynamics of Movement\" by Rudolph Laban. We conduct a feasibility study to classify the expressive intentions of dance phrases encapsulated within a dance routine. We detail the interacting components of our system and discuss the interpretation and conversion of subjective dance principles into quantified metrics. MoveFeel demonstrates promise in generating metrics that can effectively distinguish dance phrases that are associated with positively or negatively expressed emotion. Our goal is to build upon these techniques and apply them to the movement arts (dance, theatre), medicine (therapy), and education.",

Thus, developing a conceptual framework for archiving, managing, curating and analysing movement data, in order to develop reusable datasets and algorithms for a variety of purposes, remains a challenge. In this work, based on relevant literature on movement representation and existing systems such as Laban Movement Analysis, as well as working with dance experts through workshops, focus groups, and interviews, we propose a conceptual framework for creating, and analysing dance learning content. The conceptual framework, has been developed within an interdisciplinary project, that brings together technology and human computer interaction researchers, computer science engineers, motion capture experts from industry and academia, as well as dance experts with background on four different dance genres: contemporary, ballet, Greek folk, and flamenco. The framework has been applied: a) as a guidance to systematically create a movement library with multimodal recordings for dance education, including four different dance genres, b) as the basis for developing controlled vocabularies of dance for manual and automated annotation, and c) as the conceptual framework to define the requirements for similarity search and feature extraction.",

We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Laban Feature descriptor (STLF) for dance style recognition based on Laban theory. Laban Movement Analysis has become increasingly popular as a language to describe, index and record human motion. We only exploit motion features and body-pose information without encoding the appearance. The model is tested on some action recognition benchmarks and ICD, a challenging dataset of YouTube dance videos. Unlike other works, where Laban based features have been used in constrained environments, with static camera, sensors and no background noise, we employ STLF on videos in unconstrained and natural settings. It is robust to camera jitter, zoom variations and other acquisition conditions and is computationally cheap. It performs comparable or better than the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Similar to language and music, dance performances provide an effective way to express human emotions. With the abundance of the motion capture data, content‐based motion retrieval and classification have been fiercely investigated. Although researchers attempt to interpret body language in terms of human emotions, the progress is limited by the scarce 3D motion database annotated with emotion labels. This article proposes a hybrid feature for emotional classification in dance performances. The hybrid feature is composed of an explicit feature and a deep feature. The explicit feature is calculated based on the Laban movement analysis, which considers the body, effort, shape, and space properties. The deep feature is obtained from latent representation through a 1D convolutional autoencoder. Eventually, we present an elaborate feature fusion network to attain the hybrid feature that is almost linearly separable. The abundant experiments demonstrate that our hybrid feature is superior to the separate features for the emotional classification in dance performances.",

Low-quality data will lead to low-quality mining results. \" How can the data be preprocessed in order to help improve the quality of the data and, consequently, of the mining results? How can the data be preprocessed so as to improve the efficiency and ease of the mining process? \" There are several data preprocessing techniques. Data cleaning can be applied to remove noise and correct inconsistencies in data. Data integration merges data from multiple sources into a coherent data store such as a data warehouse. Data reduction can reduce data size by, for instance, aggregating, eliminating redundant features, or clustering. Data transformations (e.g., normalization) may be applied, where data are scaled to fall within a smaller range like 0.0 to 1.0. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of mining algorithms involving distance measurements. These techniques are not mutually exclusive; they may work together. For example, data cleaning can involve transformations to correct wrong data, such as by transforming all entries for a date field to a common format. In Chapter 2, we learned about the different attribute types and how to use basic statistical descriptions to study data characteristics. These can help identify erroneous values and outliers, which will be useful in the data cleaning and integration steps. Data processing techniques, when applied before mining, can substantially improve the overall quality of the patterns mined and/or the time required for the actual mining. In this chapter, we introduce the basic concepts of data preprocessing in Section 3.1. The methods for data preprocessing are organized into the following categories: data",

            "abstract": "Many analysis tasks for human motion rely on high-level similarity between sequences of motions, that are not an exact matches in joint angles, timing, or ordering of actions. Even the same movements performed by the same person can vary in duration and speed. Similar motions are characterized by similar sets of actions that appear frequently. In this paper we introduce motion motifs and motion signatures that are a succinct but descriptive representation of motion sequences. We first break the motion sequences to short-term movements called motion words, and then cluster the words in a high-dimensional feature space to find motifs. Hence, motifs are words that are both common and descriptive, and their distribution represents the motion sequence. To cluster words and find motifs, the challenge is to define an effective feature space, where the distances among motion words are semantically meaningful, and where variations in speed and duration are handled. To this end, we use a deep neural network to embed the motion words into feature space using a triplet loss function. To define a signature, we choose a finite set of motion-motifs, creating a bag-of-motifs representation for the sequence. Motion signatures are agnostic to movement order, speed or duration variations, and can distinguish fine-grained differences between motions of the same class. We illustrate examples of characterizing motion sequences by motifs, and for the use of motion signatures in a number of applications.",

Most algorithms deal with FER as a pure classification problem, assuming that expressions are exclusive to each other. In this letter, the problem of FER is tackled from a more detailed view: learning to discriminate expressions with consideration of the secondary information. We propose the Secondary Information aware Facial Expression Network (SIFE-Net) to explore the latent components without auxiliary labeling, and we propose a novel dynamic weighting strategy to teach the SIFE-Net. In contrast to traditional classifiers trained with one-hot labels, the proposed SIFE-Net takes advantage of secondary expression information and has more rational feature distributions. We carry out extensive experiments and analysis on three widely-used FER datasets, i.e. the CK+ dataset, the JAFFE dataset, and the RAF dataset. Experimental results show that the SIFE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.",

            "abstract": "Following the success of deep convolutional networks, state-of-the-art methods for 3d human pose estimation have focused on deep end-to-end systems that predict 3d joint locations given raw image pixels. Despite their excellent performance, it is often not easy to understand whether their remaining error stems from a limited 2d pose (visual) understanding, or from a failure to map 2d poses into 3- dimensional positions.,,With the goal of understanding these sources of error, we set out to build a system that given 2d joint locations predicts 3d positions. Much to our surprise, we have found that, with current technology, \"lifting\" ground truth 2d joint locations to 3d space is a task that can be solved with a remarkably low error rate: a relatively simple deep feedforward network outperforms the best reported result by about 30% on Human3.6M, the largest publicly available 3d pose estimation benchmark. Furthermore, training our system on the output of an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art 2d detector (i.e., using images as input) yields state of the art results – this includes an array of systems that have been trained end-to-end specifically for this task. Our results indicate that a large portion of the error of modern deep 3d pose estimation systems stems from their visual analysis, and suggests directions to further advance the state of the art in 3d human pose estimation.",

Through our research, we report on a novel methodology to investigate user’s trust in auditory assistance in a Virtual Reality (VR) based search task, under both high and low cognitive load and under varying levels of agent accuracy. We collected physiological sensor data such as electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and heart-rate variability (HRV), subjective data through questionnaire such as System Trust Scale (STS), Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ) and NASA-TLX. We also collected a behavioral measure of trust (congruency of users’ head motion in response to valid/ invalid verbal advice from the agent). Our results indicate that our custom VR environment enables researchers to measure and understand human trust in virtual agents using the matrices, and both cognitive load and agent accuracy play an important role in trust formation. We discuss the implications of the research and directions for future work.",

The most fundamental issue is how to learn an effective and accurate representation from spatiotemporal action sequences towards improved performance, and this article aims to address the aforementioned challenge. In particular, we design a novel method of hybrid features' extraction based on the construction of multistream networks and their organic fusion. First, we train a convolution neural networks (CNN) model to learn CNN‐based features with the raw skeleton coordinates and their temporal differences serving as input signals. The attention mechanism is injected into the CNN model to weigh more effective and important information. Then, we employ long short‐term memory (LSTM) to obtain long‐term temporal features from action sequences. Finally, we generate the hybrid features by fusing the CNN and LSTM networks, and we classify action types with the hybrid features. The extensive experiments are performed on several large‐scale publically available databases, and promising results demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

The idea of gesture is the foundation of the proposed interactive strategies, and is discussed from different points of view. The current implementation uses the Max/Msp programming language and Kinect sensors. The segmentation of dance gestures is based on the inspection of the zero-crossings of the acceleration curve of ea- ch body joint. Concepts from Laban Movement Analysis are used to qualify the extracted gestures. Dance improvi- sations on Petrushka excerpts are the basis of a case study, where the relations between the music (tempo, pulses,instrumentation, character) and Laban Basic Actions are stressed.  \n \n \n",

            "title": "Musical Gestures: concepts and methods in research",
            "abstract": "In the last decade, cognitive science underwent a change of paradigm by bringing human movement into the focus of research. Concepts such as ‘embodiment’ and ‘enactive’ have been proposed as core concepts reflecting the role of the human body in complex processes such as action and perception, and the interaction of mind and physical environment (Varela et al., 1991; Noë, 2004). In music research, human movement has often been related with the notion of gesture. The reason is that many musical activities (performance, conducting, dancing) involve body movements that evoke meanings, and therefore these movements are called gestures. In Camurri et al. (2005), musical gestures are addressed from the viewpoint of their expressive character. However, there are many ways in which music-related body movements can be approached, measured, described and applied. Accordingly, there are many ways in which musical gestures are meaningful. Given the different contexts in which gestures appear, and their close relationship to movement and meaning, one may be tempted to say that the notion of gesture is too broad, ill-defined and perhaps too vague. Yet the use of this notion is very convenient in modern music research, because it allows making a bridge between movement and meaning. A closer look at the term gesture reveals its potential as a core notion that provides access to central issues in action/perception processes and in mind/environment interactions.",

        "title": "The efficacy of Laban movement analysis as a framework for observing and analysing space in Rosas danst Rosas",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article forms part of a larger qualitative, conceptual project that investigates the ways in which Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) can contribute to the larger field of dance research and education with reference to dance, new technologies and particularly notions of space in screendance. Screendance refers to a dance that is specifically made for the camera or the screen, or rendered in either film, video or digital technologies, resulting in a form that is both screen related and kinesthetic. This article aims to introduce an alternative vocabulary for observing and analysing the ways in which screendance and specifically, Rosas danst Rosas, utilises space. Observation within the context of LMA refers to recognising changes regarding the Body, Effort, Shape and Space patterns observable in a mover. Therefore, this observational and analytical approach facilitates an awareness regarding the specific spatial, temporal and dynamic qualities attributed to the movements, gestures and expressions perceived in Rosas danst Rosas. This article demonstrates the applicability and efficacy of LMA as a framework for observing and analysing screendance as a hybrid of dance and screen, with reference to space in Rosas danst Rosas.",

        "abstract": "Wheelchair dance is an important form of disability art that is still subject to significant levels of ableism and art exclusion. Wheelchair dancers face challenges finding teachers and choreographers who can accommodate their needs, documenting and sharing choreographies that suit their body shapes and their assistive technologies. In turn, this hinders their ability to share creative expressions. Accessible resources and communication tools could help address these challenges. The goal of this research is the development of a visualization system grounded on Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) that notates movement quality while opening new horizons on perceptions of disabled bodies and the artistic legitimacy of wheelchair dance. The system uses video to identify the body landmarks of the dancer and wheelchair and extracts key features to create visualizations of expressive qualities from LMA basic effort. The current evaluation includes a pilot study with the general public and an online questionnaire targeting professionals to gain feedback supporting practical implementation and real-world deployment. Results from the general public evaluation showed that the visualization was effective in conveying basic effort movement qualities even to a novice audience. Expert consulted via questionnaire stated that the tool could be employed for reflective evaluation, as well as performance augmentation. The LMA visualization tool can support the artistic legitimization of wheelchair dancing through education, communication, performance, and documentation.",

            "abstract": "Analyzing and documenting contemporary dance movement data has proven to be a very difficult task due to the vast existence of styles and aesthetics which are characteristic of each individual choreographer. Indeed, identifying movement qualities with the intention of co-relating them to specific meanings and choreographic intentions is practically impossible without taking an artist-driven approach. Moreover, equipping dancers with wearable technology in order to accurately track each of their movements is only applicable in controlled laboratory scenarios, therefore not being a viable approach to analyze large scale real-world rehearsals or performances. This paper describes a visualization system that exposes movement qualities for dance through rendering effects. Combining optical flow analysis with depth video information, we were able to estimate the three-dimensional flow for each point in the cloud. This information was used to color point cloud videos with this information, showing potential to be used for the creation of different rendering effects, which are also discussed in this paper. The data used was captured in a non-intrusive manner during the creation process of a dance piece by Portuguese choreographer Rui Lopes Graça, enabling us to examine nuances and details of the rehearsals' process, which would not be replicable in a laboratory environment.",

From these dimensions we have created a new affective interaction model, which we name the affective gestural plane model. We applied this model to the design of gestural affective input to a mobile service for affective messages.",

Central to this approach is the idea that movement can be captured graphically for its analysis via different techniques of graphic representation: including drawing, 3D modelling, graphs, diagrams and notation. The article also argues that graphic models play a key role in the development of Laban's theory of harmonic space. Based on a series of geometric and topological models Laban was able to develop a material method as part of his creative research on movement analysis. My claim is that Laban's graphic approach encourages the use of visual media and technologies of graphic inscription as inventive methods for the better understanding of movement, which is why Laban's thinking can be adequately reconceptualised using technologies like video and motion capture.

In the early twentieth century, choreographers used the figure of the puppet to negotiate tensions between modern mechanization, national folk traditions, and expressive human movement. Modernism's dancing marionettes leap across national borders and genres of dance to appear in Michel Fokine's Petrouchka (1911), the Marionette Dance (1916) of Japanese-born modern dancer Ito Michio, and Bauhaus artist Oskar Schlemmer's Das Triadische Ballett (Triadic Ballet, 1922). All were influenced by modernist marionette theories that referenced Heinrich von Kleist and Gordon Craig. Ballet, modern, and avant-garde dance are often considered separate trajectories in modernism, but their use of the dancing marionette demonstrates a common impulse to explore the relation between machine and human movements.",

Traditionally emotional education has focussed on cognitive skills-based interventions. By connecting the principles of dance movement therapy (DMT), EI development, Emotional Regulation (ER) and the benefits of movement, a bridge is built permitting the proposal of a DMT EI Educational Model. Laban Bartenieff Movement Analysis (LBMA) together with the relationship between motor patterns and emotions is a core part of this proposal. A reflective process based on previous experiences of IE development in academic settings by one of the authors has enriched the model. It is organised into four modules; each module is associated with an EI branch, a social-emotional skill, a DMT element, an exploration quality, an aimed outcome and examples. Some suggestions about the applicability in different contexts and populations have also been incorporated.",

            "abstract": "Emotion communication research strongly focuses on the face and voice as expressive modalities, leaving the rest of the body relatively understudied. Contrary to the early assumption that body movement only indicates emotional intensity, recent studies have shown that body movement and posture also conveys emotion specific information. However, a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is hampered by a lack of production studies informed by a theoretical framework. In this research we adopted the Body Action and Posture (BAP) coding system to examine the types and patterns of body movement that are employed by 10 professional actors to portray a set of 12 emotions. We investigated to what extent these expression patterns support explicit or implicit predictions from basic emotion theory, bidimensional theory, and componential appraisal theory. The overall results showed partial support for the different theoretical approaches. They revealed that several patterns of body movement systematically occur in portrayals of specific emotions, allowing emotion differentiation. Although a few emotions were prototypically expressed by one particular pattern, most emotions were variably expressed by multiple patterns, many of which can be explained as reflecting functional components of emotion such as modes of appraisal and action readiness. It is concluded that further work in this largely underdeveloped area should be guided by an appropriate theoretical framework to allow a more systematic design of experiments and clear hypothesis testing.",

In this article, conceptions of emotionality and regulation and ways in which they predict social functioning are examined. Linear (including additive) and nonlinear effects are reviewed. In addition, data on mediational and moderational relations from a longitudinal study are presented. The effects of attention regulation on social functioning were mediated by resiliency, and this relation was moderated by negative emotionality at the first, but not second, assessment. Negative emotionality moderated the relation of behavior regulation to socially appropriate/prosocial behavior. These results highlight the importance of examining different types of regulation and the ways in which dispositional characteristics interact in predicting social outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Background: Dance is an embodied activity and, when applied therapeutically, can have several specific and unspecific health benefits. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of dance movement therapy1(DMT) and dance interventions for psychological health outcomes. Research in this area grew considerably from 1.3 detected studies/year in 1996–2012 to 6.8 detected studies/year in 2012–2018. Method: We synthesized 41 controlled intervention studies (N = 2,374; from 01/2012 to 03/2018), 21 from DMT, and 20 from dance, investigating the outcome clusters of quality of life, clinical outcomes (with sub-analyses of depression and anxiety), interpersonal skills, cognitive skills, and (psycho-)motor skills. We included recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in areas such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, elderly patients, oncology, neurology, chronic heart failure, and cardiovascular disease, including follow-up data in eight studies. Results: Analyses yielded a medium overall effect (d2 = 0.60), with high heterogeneity of results (I2 = 72.62%). Sorted by outcome clusters, the effects were medium to large (d = 0.53 to d = 0.85). All effects, except the one for (psycho-)motor skills, showed high inconsistency of results. Sensitivity analyses revealed that type of intervention (DMT or dance) was a significant moderator of results. In the DMT cluster, the overall medium effect was small, significant, and homogeneous/consistent (d = 0.30, p < 0.001, I2 = 3.47). In the dance intervention cluster, the overall medium effect was large, significant, yet heterogeneous/non-consistent (d = 0.81, p < 0.001, I2 = 77.96). Results suggest that DMT decreases depression and anxiety and increases quality of life and interpersonal and cognitive skills, whereas dance interventions increase (psycho-)motor skills. Larger effect sizes resulted from observational measures, possibly indicating bias. Follow-up data showed that on 22 weeks after the intervention, most effects remained stable or slightly increased. Discussion: Consistent effects of DMT coincide with findings from former meta-analyses. Most dance intervention studies came from preventive contexts and most DMT studies came from institutional healthcare contexts with more severely impaired clinical patients, where we found smaller effects, yet with higher clinical relevance. Methodological shortcomings of many included studies and heterogeneity of outcome measures limit results. Initial findings on long-term effects are promising.",

Utilizing an emotion regulation framework in conceptualization, intervention, and therapeutic process may facilitate the development of regulatory abilities that will alleviate suffering and enhance clients' capacities to navigate difficult life challenges and pursue meaningful goals. \n \n \nKeywords: \n \nemotion; \nregulation; \nmechanism; \nskill; \nattention; \nacceptance; \ndistancing; \ncognitive; \nchange; \nreappraisal",

            "abstract": "Movement is a basic form of gaining experience and communication through which children learn to cope with different tasks in their lives (Sharir, 2007). Humans are capable of using their bodies to express their ideas and emotions through movement (Ronen, 2011). In particular, children learn to move their bodies, develop their imagination and express their thoughts through dance (Bahat-Ratzon, 2004). This research study focuses on two important areas for proper overall child development: the area of motor skills and the area of emotions. The study examined the effect of folk dancing/circle dancing on emotional self-control and regulation and self-confidence among early childhood-aged children, while comparing circle dancing to dancing in an unorganized open space. In addition, the study examined the effect of circle dancing on the children’s emotional intelligence abilities. Questionnaires were distributed to 60 children from a varied age range in two kibbutz kindergarten classes: in one kindergarten class, the children gained experience in dancing in an organized fashion throughout the year; in the second kindergarten class, the children were not exposed to folk dancing. The Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire examined the emotional intelligence level of the children in both kindergarten classes and their progress in this area throughout the year. The findings showed evidence of an improvement in emotional intelligence among children in both kindergarten classes; there were significant differences between children in the two classes regarding some emotional intelligence variables as a result of circle dancing. In addition, the findings point to a strong correlation between circle dancing and emotional regulation and self-control. On the contrary, no strong correlation was found between emotional regulation and self-control and the variables of gender and age of the children.",

            "title": "A Qualitative Study of the Views of Patients With Medically Unexplained Symptoms on The BodyMind Approach®: Employing Embodied Methods and Arts Practices for Self-Management",
            "abstract": "The arts provide openings for symbolic expression by engaging the sensory experience in the body they become a source of insight through embodied cognition and emotion, enabling meaning-making, and acting as a catalyst for change. This synthesis of sensation and enactive, embodied expression through movement and the arts is capitalized on in The BodyMind Approach® (TBMA). It is integral to this biopsychosocial, innovative, unique intervention for people suffering medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) applied in primary healthcare. The relevance of embodiment and arts practices in TBMA are discussed in relation to the views of participants in the pursuit of self-management. If widely employed TBMA could have an enormous impact, reach, and significance for patients and global health services. This original pre-clinical trial of qualitative research reports on the perceptions of participant patients with generic MUS, a world-wide issue usually treated by either psychological therapy or physiotherapy. TBMA is not a therapy but a health education program founded upon the concept of an integration of psychological elements with physiological, bodily, and sensory experiences. Thematic analysis of qualitative data sets from open-ended questions in semi-structured interviews and a written questionnaire post intervention is presented. Five aspects which appear to be key to learning self-management were derived from analyzing the data: (1) body with mind connections; (2) importance of facilitation; (3) potential benefits; (4) preparedness for change; (5) self-acceptance/compassion. This article advances the discourse on the nature of self-management for MUS through changing the mind-set and the relationship participants have with their bodily symptom/s through employing embodied methods and arts practices, challenging current, and solely verbal, psychological conceptual frameworks. Rigor lies in the method of data analysis using cross verification of credibility between reported findings and scrutiny by stakeholders. We conclude that facilitated TBMA groups employing embodied methods and arts practices can act as a method for developing the self-management of MUS and improving wellbeing.",

This work provides a didactic proposal to perform Expressive Movement & Creative Dance (EMCD) at home adaptable to distinct educational levels and useful as a valuable online or face-to-face education experience even when the coronavirus crisis ends. The proposal is based on the Laban Movement Analysis, the Theatre of the Oppressed, and Lipdub. It seeks to develop students’ own artistic body language, emotional intelligence, healthy physical activity and social awareness. Furthermore, it intends to promote the creation of a new social movement (#VIDLOP) using art and popular media as empowering and democratic channels for building a better world. In conclusion, this may be a promising proposal to develop the EMCD and human awareness in challenging scenarios and distinct educational settings.",

The system can recognise predefined movement qualities through gesture analysis. It also allows for the control of abstract visuals based on physical models, specifically mass-springs models, displaying graphical animations with ‘qualities’ reflecting the participants’ expressions. \n \nThis work has been implemented and tested in an interactive installation called ‘Double Skin/Double Mind’. In that context, we were able to test the contribution of our system to dance pedagogy and to collect participants’ feedback. These preliminary tests suggest that the dancers can embrace the interaction with physical model-based visuals. They also reveal that the movement qualities of the visuals generated by our system fairly mirror the dancers’ own qualities.",

The present research, using a mixed methodology, collected data in three different population groups (volunteer participants, flamenco dancers and dance movement therapists), where the movements of flamenco dance were analysed in relation to the expression of emotions, using the movement qualities of Laban. The feelings and motivation that drove the dancers to use this dance style were also analysed. The results provide information about the relationship between basic flamenco movements and some emotions especially represented by certain movement patterns. The results obtained suggest that flamenco dance could represent a useful instrument for the expression and channelling of emotions in the context of dance movement therapy.",

Drawing on embodied theories of cognition, the author argues that thinking about power involves mental simulation of space and can be interfered with by perception of vertical differences. Study 1 assessed image schemas for power and found a shared vertical difference metaphor. Studies 2, 3, and 4 showed that the judgment of a group's power is influenced by the group's vertical position in space and motor responses implying vertical movement. Study 5 ruled out that the influence of vertical position on power judgments is driven by valence differences. Study 6 showed that vertical position also influences the power judgment result itself. The evidence suggests that the concept of power is partly represented in perceptual form as vertical difference.",

            "abstract": "We have recently demonstrated that motor execution, observation, and imagery of movements expressing certain emotions can enhance corresponding affective states and therefore could be used for emotion regulation. But which specific movement(s) should one use in order to enhance each emotion? This study aimed to identify, using Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), the Laban motor elements (motor characteristics) that characterize movements whose execution enhances each of the basic emotions: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. LMA provides a system of symbols describing its motor elements, which gives a written instruction (motif) for the execution of a movement or movement-sequence over time. Six senior LMA experts analyzed a validated set of video clips showing whole body dynamic expressions of anger, fear, happiness and sadness, and identified the motor elements that were common to (appeared in) all clips expressing the same emotion. For each emotion, we created motifs of different combinations of the motor elements common to all clips of the same emotion. Eighty subjects from around the world read and moved those motifs, to identify the emotion evoked when moving each motif and to rate the intensity of the evoked emotion. All subjects together moved and rated 1241 motifs, which were produced from 29 different motor elements. Using logistic regression, we found a set of motor elements associated with each emotion which, when moved, predicted the feeling of that emotion. Each emotion was predicted by a unique set of motor elements and each motor element predicted only one emotion. Knowledge of which specific motor elements enhance specific emotions can enable emotional self-regulation through adding some desired motor qualities to one's personal everyday movements (rather than mimicking others' specific movements) and through decreasing motor behaviors which include elements that enhance negative emotions.",

While some studies have found evidence for specific body movements accompanying specific emotions, others indicate that movement behavior (aside from facial expression) may be only indicative of the quantity (intensity) of emotion, but not of its quality. The study reported here is an attempt to demonstrate that body movements and postures to some degree are specific for certain emotions. A sample of 224 video takes, in which actors and actresses portrayed the emotions of elated joy, happiness, sadness, despair, fear, terror, cold anger, hot anger, disgust, contempt, shame, guilt, pride, and boredom via a scenario approach, was analyzed using coding schemata for the analysis of body movements and postures. Results indicate that some emotion-specific movement and posture characteristics seem to exist, but that for body movements differences between emotions can be partly explained by the dimension of activation. While encoder (actor) differences are rather pronounced with respect to specific movement and posture habits, these differences are largely independent from the emotion-specific differences found. The results are discussed with respect to emotion-specific discrete expression models in contrast to dimensional models of emotion encoding. Copyright © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Flamenco, the Spanish dance, is about expressing oneself with clarity, beauty, strength, pride, and self-confidence. Trauma survivors have often lost the ability to express themselves authentically, because they feel disconnected from themselves, or from life, often associate strength with violence, and can be flooded by strong emotions when moving. Due to the suitability of Flamenco to produce sensations of strength, pride, and well-being via body feedback, clinical institutions are starting to use Flamenco in the context of dance, music, or body psychotherapy for trauma survivors. In an experimental pilot study, N = 32 traumatized inpatients (n = 16 patients in the experimental group assessed before and after receiving a single Flamenco Therapy intervention, and n = 16 patients in the control group receiving treatment as usual) were tested for change on the following outcomes: well-being, body self-efficacy, interpersonal resonance, plus experienced health, fitness, and pain levels. Results suggest a significant improvement of well-being, improvement of experienced health level, and improvement of experienced physical pain after Flamenco therapy in the experimental group compared to the control group, and a marginal effect for improvement of interpersonal resonance (p < .10 on both measures). Given the fact that the small sample already provided considerable suggestive effects, results are encouraging, but because of the underpowered sample needs further testing. Findings and limitations are discussed with respect to active factors of dance movement therapy.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sexual harassment is a type of trauma that causes various physiological and mental phenomena, including a regression in the perception of body image and its preoccupation with it. Studies indicate that there is a link between psychological functioning and physical function, where engagement with the body affects psychological functioning. Research has pointed to the relationship between body image and dance in the therapeutic context. It has been shown that there is a positive and close relationship between dancing and movement and the way women perceive their bodies. The main purpose of this study was to examine how the frequent practice of belly dance, also called Oriental dance, affects perception of body image and self-esteem among women who have experienced sexual harassment in the past. In this study, 152 subjects were examined, 78 women who partake in belly dance and 74 women who do not. Research hypotheses were confirmed, and a significant positive correlation was found between self-esteem, body image, and belly dancing among women who previously experienced sexual harassment.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT English speakers use vertical language to talk about power, such as when speaking of people being “at the bottom of the social hierarchy” or “rising to the top.” Experimental research has shown that people automatically associate higher spatial positions with more powerful social groups, such as doctors and army generals, compared to lower spatial positions, which are associated with relatively less powerful groups, such as nurses and soldiers. However, power as a social dimension is also associated with gender. Here, by means of a reaction-time study and a corpus study, we show that professions that display greater gender asymmetries, such as doctor/nurse, exhibit stronger vertical associations. Moreover, we show that people’s perception of vertical metaphors for power depends on their own gender, with male participants having stronger vertical biases than female participants, which we propose is due to the fact that men are more prone to thinking about power in bodily terms, and to associate it with physical dominance. Our results provide clear evidence for individual differences in metaphor comprehension, thus demonstrating empirically that the same metaphor is understood differently by different people.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this study, we use a narrative inquiry approach to understand how students construct their artistic voices as part of their educational experience in California community college dance classes. Data collection techniques included semi-structured interviews, video recordings of a dance performance, and a reflective one-page journal where participants described the attributes of their artistic voices. Participants included ten community college dance students. We used socio-cultural theories and the Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) framework to analyze individuals’ personal construction and movement vocabulary. We present three findings to inform dance teachers. First, deeper self-understanding was a foundational component of students’ artistic voice. Second, the performance of the artistic voice was guided by students’ construction of personal-interpretative narratives that inspired their bodily choices. Third, the construction of the artistic voice was sustained through three types of power negotiation (compliance, resiliency, and resistance).",

I contend that although like language dance communicates through cultural codes, it does not convey literal messages but then neither is dance dominated by a requirement for factual specificity. I argue, however, that dance is structured like a language and I provide an analysis of the methods according to which language functions on an everyday basis. I review linguistic categories and argue for their counterparts in dance including vocabulary and syntax, the utterance and the speech act. The speech act is an important instance of language use which I hold is represented in dance; and in addressing this topic I shed new light on the performative quality of dance. The various theoretical issues discussed in the essay are illustrated by examples taken from modern and postmodern dance as well as from classical ballet.",

This article contributes to that reinvigoration by reviewing the use of the concept of ‘character’, considering whether the evidence supports the notion of ‘emotional character’ as a psychological construct, and suggesting new prospects for research on emotional character in embodied learning contexts such as the performing arts. Using the example of dance, it is argued that, while expertise requires training to develop concrete skills and good habits of mind to improve performance, becoming a dance artist requires something more. The performing arts communicate emotional ‘felt’ experience. The idea of emotional character describes an individual’s propensity to experience and express those feelings that create connection: to self, society, and the natural world. The aim of this essay is to remind those of us charged with the development of others that artistry goes beyond ability and that, in training, feeling is as important as thinking or doing.",

        "abstract": "Current research into music and free dance movement explores differences in corporeal articulation of basic emotions. Accordingly, Van Dyck et al. (2014, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0089773) report congruent emotion recognition in free dance movements recorded after happiness or sadness inductions in lay dancers. The current study replicates this previous study with an advanced methodological approach measuring ratings of happiness and sadness recognition separately within both happy and sad conditions. We then tested the differences between the recognition of happiness and sadness in free dance movements. Therefore, a dance movement pre-study was conducted in two different conditions where either happiness or sadness were induced within four lay dancers using guided imagery and music listening. Subsequent to this, dancers were video recorded while moving freely to a neutral piece of music. Those silenced video recordings were then presented to participants (N = 37) in an online experiment, who were instructed to rate the emotion they recognised. Based on the Effort-Shape Theory by Rudolf Laban, observers also rated kinematic features of velocity/acceleration, directness, impulsiveness and expansion. Participants rated higher levels of happiness for the happy-induction condition compared to sadness. However, participants rated higher levels of sadness in the sad condition compared to happiness for just one of the four dancers. This finding indicates that it is easier to recognise happiness in free dance movements than sadness. The results of the kinematic features supported previous research which rated higher intensities for the happy condition than the sad condition.",

            "abstract": "Recent research revealed that emotional content can be successfully decoded from human dance movement. Most previous studies made use of videos of actors or dancers portraying emotions through choreography. The current study applies emotion induction techniques and free movement in order to examine the recognition of emotional content from dance. Observers (N = 30) watched a set of silent videos showing depersonalized avatars of dancers moving to an emotionally neutral musical stimulus after emotions of either sadness or happiness had been induced. Each of the video clips consisted of two dance performances which were presented side-by-side and were played simultaneously; one of a dancer in the happy condition and one of the same individual in the sad condition. After every film clip, the observers were asked to make forced-choices concerning the emotional state of the dancer. Results revealed that observers were able to identify the emotional state of the dancers with a high degree of accuracy. Moreover, emotions were more often recognized for female dancers than for their male counterparts. In addition, the results of eye tracking measurements unveiled that observers primarily focus on movements of the chest when decoding emotional information from dance movement. The findings of our study show that not merely portrayed emotions, but also induced emotions can be successfully recognized from free dance movement.",

In light of this, the present research contends that the emotions expressed by musical stimuli are associated with their pleasing and arousing qualities. Sixty subjects rated 32 musical excerpts on 11-point scales representing the expression of eight specific emotions. Statistical analyses showed that these emotion ratings were predictable on the basis of 60 additional subjects' ratings of each excerpt in terms of 'liking' and 'arousal potential'. This indicates that ratings of liking and arousal potential are essentially similar to ratings of the specific emotions expressed by musical stimuli. These results are discussed in terms of the relationship between liking and arousal potential, and the implications that this may have for research on affective processes.",

Research into dance aesthetics has largely focussed on subjective features like familiarity with the observed movement but has rarely studied objective features like speed or acceleration. We manipulated the kinematic complexity of observed actions, by creating dance sequences that varied in movement timing, but not in movement trajectory. Dance-naïve participants rated the dance videos on speed, effort, reproducibility, and preference. Using linear mixed-effects modeling, we show that faster movement sequences with varied velocity profiles are judged to be more effortful, less reproducible, and more aesthetically pleasing than slower sequences with uniform velocity profiles. Accordingly, dance aesthetics depend not only on which movement is being performed but on how movements are executed and linked. Accordingly, the aesthetics of movement timing may apply across culturally-specific dance styles and predict both preference for and perceived difficulty of dance, consistent with an effort heuristic account of art appreciation.",

            "abstract": "Process of Improvisational Contemporary Dance Yuko Nakano (qq096220@iii.u-tokyo.ac.jp) Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies, University of Tokyo Tokyo 113-0033, Japan Takeshi Okada ( okadatak @ p.u-tokyo.ac.jp ) Graduate School of Education & Interfaculty Initiative in Information studies, University of Tokyo Tokyo 113-0033, Japan Abstract The purpose of this study is to investigate the process of improvisational contemporary dance. To achieve this goal, we combine two types of methodology: analysis of data from interviews with dancers and analysis of their dance performances. Our findings reveal that while dancing, in order to create their movements, improvisational dancers interact with various stimuli that come from inside and outside of themselves (for example, images and feelings that they entertain during their dancing, and the music, space and audience of their dance performances). Through such interactions, dancers organize movements in their performances extemporarily, using various expressive techniques (for example, changing speed or image intentionally and seeing themselves from the viewpoint of a third person). Keywords: Improvisation; Contemporary dance; Creativity Introduction What happens in artists’ minds when they generate their expressions or works? Recently research interest in artistic creation has been growing. There have been some empirical studies in psychology and cognitive science focused on artistic creation (e.g., Yokochi & Okada (2005) on Chinese ink painting, Tsuchikura (2010) on movie making, Tayanagi (2010) on jazz music, and Goan & Tujita (2007) on stage direction). Of the various forms of art, this study seeks to reveal the process of artistic creation empirically by focusing on dance, in particular improvisational contemporary dance. Improvisation plays a critical role in the process of artistic expression. Sasaki, a scholar of aesthetics, has pointed out the importance of improvisation as follows: “In the exact moment of their generation, expressions in the artistic genres, such as fine arts, music, and drama are not generated based on predetermined plans, but based on impromptu activities” (Sasaki, 1995). Thus, it can be considered that improvisation exists as an essential part of the process of artistic expression. Improvisational dance is one form of artistic expression in which such a process of improvisation saliently appears. Because improvisational dance presents audiences with the process of dance creation itself, making dance movements based on predetermined plans or repeating movements during dance performance is meaningless. Therefore, the process of improvisational dance contains the essence of artistic creation and expression. Previous studies in the domain of dance have pointed out the importance of improvisation in the creation of dance works, and the importance of impromptu expressions themselves (Fukumoto, 2007; 2009; Hosokawa, 2011; De Spain, 1997; Ribeiro & Fonseca, 2011; Soma & Hosokawa, 2007; Tsujimoto, 2010). Reviewing previous studies focused on how historically eminent dancers used improvisation to express themselves or create their dance works, Tsujimoto (2010) emphasized the significance of improvisation in dance. Tsujimoto (2010) also described an anecdote that when dancing extemporarily, the dancer's body instantly responded to stimuli from dance partners, the surrounding environment, and sensations born within the body. Through reviews of previous studies, Ribeiro & Fonseca (2011) also reported dancers’ experience while dancing extemporarily. They suggested that improvisational dance is formed by “the interaction of the body with the environment and the affective and cognitive systems” (Ribeiro & Fonseca, 2011). Although these studies offer useful insights, these findings are based on reviews and anecdotal evidence, rather than on empirical evidence. They did not empirically investigate what stimuli dancers interact with in the process of improvisation or how dancers create their works. In contrast, using information from reviews of a dancer’s works, interviews with her, and field experiments, Hosokawa (2011) studied the process and skills of improvisational dance, focusing on Kei Takei, a famous contemporary dancer. On the basis of the results of the study, Hosokawa (2011) suggests that Kei Takei generates movement sequences intuitively based on her physical skill, and polishes movement sequences to develop her dance work in keeping with her dance philosophy. De Spain (1997) constructed a theoretical model about the process of solo dance improvisation through interviews and introspective reports with improvisers of dance. De Spain’s model broke down the elements of improvisation into the categories of physical operands/operators, cognitive/affective operands/operators, determination, and attention. “The model also emphasized the importance of considering the existing state and flow of the improvisation at the moment of new action/interaction” (De Spain, 1997). Although Hosokawa (2011) and De Spain (1997) revealed",

        "abstract": "Creative dance, that is to say, movements, with or without music, which allow participants to express ideas, thoughts, and feelings, are sometimes accompanied by a ‘there is no right or wrong way to move’ rhetoric. This may reinforce the impression among physical education teacher education (PETE) students, who often have limited experience of (creative) dance, that there is nothing to practise in creative dance and that this activity is merely directionless movement. In this paper, however, based on Aggerholm's notion of practising movements, we explore an occasion in a PETE course where a magic moment occurred, indicating that the students had practised and ‘figured out’ something that made this moment possible. The purpose of the paper is to explore the knowledge in movement that PETE students were practising as they participated in creative dance. The purpose is also to shed light on what pedagogical practice contributed to enabling such practising. Video documentation and short interviews with students in one PETE course and one continuing professional development course for physical education teachers indicate that the magic moment was made possible as the students’ practised making sense of moving in non-predetermined – creative – ways and appreciating the expressive dimension of movement. Laban's movement analysis framework seemed, along with the teachers’ knowledge of movement, to be an important element in the pedagogical practice that made the magic moment possible.",

            "abstract": "L anguage has been granted too much power. The linguistic turn, the semiotic turn, the interpretative turn, the cultural turn: it seems that at every turn lately every “thing”—even materiality—is turned into a matter of language or some other form of cultural representation. The ubiquitous puns on “matter” do not, alas, mark a rethinking of the key concepts (materiality and signification) and the relationship between them. Rather, it seems to be symptomatic of the extent to which matters of “fact” (so to speak) have been replaced with matters of signification (no scare quotes here). Language matters. Discourse matters. Culture matters. There is an important sense in which the only thing that does not seem to matter anymore is matter. What compels the belief that we have a direct access to cultural representations and their content that we lack toward the things represented? How did language come to be more trustworthy than matter? Why are language and culture granted their own agency and historicity while matter is figured as passive and immutable, or at best inherits a potential for change derivatively from language and culture? How does one even go about inquiring after the material conditions that have led us to such a brute reversal of naturalist beliefs when materiality itself is always already figured within a linguistic domain as its condition of possibility?",

I evaluate the various justifications for creative dance as movement, therapy, integration, and art and examine how these thwart or do not thwart the need for an unambiguous inclusion of creative dance as an art form. Pour justifier l’integration de la danse creative dans les programmes scolaires, on invoque sa valeur comme art, comme mouvement et comme therapie, ou encore sa place au sein d’un programme integre. Il faut que la danse creative soit incluse d’une maniere non ambigue dans les programmes scolaires en tant qu’expression artistique ayant droit de cite. Actuellement, on justifie l’integration de la danse creative dans divers programmes scolaires en faisant appel a des raisons contradictoires et ambivalentes.

            "abstract": "There is international consensus that creativity is a fundamental outcome of schooling. Opportunities exist to enhance the creativity of schoolchildren, particularly in movement-based subjects such as physical education (PE). In this pilot study, we investigated the effect of a six-week dance-based PE intervention on children’s creativity in a primary school context. Forty second grade students participated in a controlled trial. One class (n = 20) was assigned to the intervention and participated in dance-based PE lessons (10 girls, 10 boys; age 7–8 years). The other class (n = 20) was assigned to the control condition and continued regular PE with no dance (10 girls, 10 boys; age 7–8 years). Pre–post assessment of creativity was obtained through an adapted version of Guilford’s (1967) Alternative Uses task. Data were analysed using linear mixed models, with adjustment made for children’s perceived dance ability and for baseline differences in creativity between groups. The overall effect of the intervention was small (d = 0.36, 95%CI = –0.21 to 0.92), but not statistically significant (p = 0.21). Post-hoc analysis revealed a large difference in the effect of the intervention between children with above and below-average baseline creativity (d = 1.26, 95%CI = 0.14 to 2.39, p = 0.03). Children with above-average creativity at baseline benefitted more (d = 0.99, 95%CI = 0.01 to 1.96, p = 0.047). This pilot study provides further support for the place of dance and creativity within the PE curriculum. However, particular attention should be given to students’ starting points.",

            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background There is a global consensus that stimulating and fostering children’s creativity in education is crucial. Addressing creativity has become an imperative in educational policies and in school curricula internationally. School-based physical education (PE), and specifically the teaching area of dance, has been identified as an important pedagogical setting within which to develop creativity. Existing studies have suggested, however, that dance is seldom taught in PE in ways that acknowledge creative aspects of movement learning. Scholars have claimed that teaching pre-arranged dances with predetermined movement outcomes dominate dance teaching in PE. Furthermore, studies have asserted that the overarching regulative principles of PE and PETE that privilege sport skills and physical exercise hinder creative movement learning. Still, dance teaching is frequently seen as part of expressive dance teaching in PE and PETE and is regarded as holding potential in the area of education for creativity. Little scholarly attention has been given to how teacher educators approach creative aspects in dance teaching. Purpose This article aims to create insights into how PETE teacher educators understand and work with creative aspects of dance in their educational practice. Method and theory To address our aim, we investigate how teacher educators describe their teaching of creative aspects of dance. To do this, empirical material was generated through qualitative interviews with PE teacher educators from each of the PETE institutions in Sweden. The theoretical concepts of smooth and striated spaces and experimentation by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari were used to guide the analysis of how the PETE educators described their teaching of creative aspects of dance. Deleuze and Guattari developed a framework that concerned questions of creativity and newness. Despite this conceptual framework having not yet been used in dance education in PE and PETE, their writing fits well when analysing questions of creativity in an educational context. Findings We identified three major themes relating to creativity in the empirical material: (a) creative aspects of expressive dance; (b) challenges that teacher educators face when introducing movement exploration in expressive dance to their students, and; (c) the teacher educators’ pedagogical work with students. Discussion The results of this study show that teaching expressive dance can take teaching in PE and PETE in new directions. The results provide insights into alternative ways of teaching in these educational settings that can counter the dominant ways of teaching dance. Results suggest that teacher educators operate in various striated spaces that are shaped by expectations and conventions. In such spaces, the educators aim to create momentary passages of smoothening that open up for experimentation and the development of students’ creativity. The results also suggest that expressive dance in PE and PETE emphasizes creative movement learning through which students learn to operate within new and unpredictable situations.",

            "title": "Dancing as searching with Deleuze – a study of what students in physical education teacher education express and experience in creative dance lessons",
            "abstract": "ABSTRACT Physical education (PE), and specifically the teaching area of dance, has been identified as an important pedagogical setting within which young people develop creativity. Creativity is thus an important aspect of schooling. Several studies have suggested however, that dance is seldom taught in PE in ways that acknowledge creative aspects of movement learning, and that students in physical education teacher education (PETE) receive insufficient training in the area of dance. Very little research has been conducted specifically on how teachers and PETE students understand the subject tradition of creative dance. The aim of this paper is to create insights into what PETE students express and experience in creative dance lessons where we specifically explore a pedagogy based on imitation. To address this aim, empirical material was generated through observations and logbooks during a pedagogical sequence of creative dance at a Swedish PETE institution. Deleuzian concepts of palpation and experimentation were used to guide our analysis. The results of this study show alternative ways of understanding what can happen when students participate in creative dance lessons. Our findings contribute to researchers’ and teacher educators’ understandings of students’ experiences of working with spaces of creativity in PETE, and how these experiences can be used in teaching of creative dance.",

In this work, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the movement interaction of participants with Bodyharp, a movement-based musical instrument. This wearable instrument offers musical affordances that allow performers to extend beyond small gestural spaces. Its wearable design encourages the performers to move while creating music and to express while using their bodies. Data was collected from twenty participants’ interactions, reflections, and compositions with Bodyharp. Video recordings of the experiment were annotated and qualitatively analyzed to reveal which performed gestures directly contribute to sound production and modification and which gestures accompany these musical actions. For a subset of participants, Musical Gestures Toolbox was used to further quantify the gestures. Using the Laban Movement Analysis framework, we observed participants’ use of space and body in their interaction with a movement-based musical instrument and how their backgrounds in music or movement (based on participants’ self-reported experiences) influenced the interaction. Our results offer design practices for creating new interactions at the intersection of music and dance.",

        "abstract": "Movement disciplines like dance or martial arts are carriers of cultural knowledge, identity, and tradition. However, oral traditions and video recordings make the preservation of this knowledge susceptible to being lost. Expert movement notation, in turn, holds the potential for precise capture and knowledge inheritance. However, motion notation approaches are not widespread, the process is often time-consuming, and the movements are hard to visualize without expert knowledge. In this work, we use Labanotation and Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), a notation system and method originally developed for dance, as a symbolic, interpretable framework for motion representation and preservation. Our contribution resides in the expansion of an existing annotation system, the LabanEditor, to handle full-body motion and data from multiple sources, and support the work of experts in annotating the movements. Our development, called MoRTELaban, supports motion-to-notation and inverse mapping from notation to keyframes, enabling exchange between video, motion capture, and Labanotation formats. This allows for the documentation and reconstruction of traditional motion practices using expert-readable scores and 3D skeletons.",

            "abstract": "Large datasets are the cornerstone of recent advances in computer vision using deep learning. In contrast, existing human motion capture (mocap) datasets are small and the motions limited, hampering progress on learning models of human motion. While there are many different datasets available, they each use a different parameterization of the body, making it difficult to integrate them into a single meta dataset. To address this, we introduce AMASS, a large and varied database of human motion that unifies 15 different optical marker-based mocap datasets by representing them within a common framework and parameterization. We achieve this using a new method, MoSh++, that converts mocap data into realistic 3D human meshes represented by a rigged body model. Here we use SMPL [Loper et al., 2015], which is widely used and provides a standard skeletal representation as well as a fully rigged surface mesh. The method works for arbitrary marker sets, while recovering soft-tissue dynamics and realistic hand motion. We evaluate MoSh++ and tune its hyperparameters using a new dataset of 4D body scans that are jointly recorded with markerbased mocap. The consistent representation of AMASS makes it readily useful for animation, visualization, and generating training data for deep learning. Our dataset is significantly richer than previous human motion collections, having more than 40 hours of motion data, spanning over 300 subjects, more than 11000 motions, and will be publicly available to the research community.",

User studies that use utilize this qualitative analysis then validate that the method can be used to generate appropriate motion in in-home contexts. The accuracy of an individual descriptive word for the developed motion is up to 77% and context accuracy is up to 83%.

While these extract precise hidden patterns in motion data, they are often task-specific and lack a semantic understatement of motion. Symbolic systems that mirror human cognition and explicit expressive processes are necessary for richer motion synthesis and analysis, enabling physical reasoning and expert knowledge encoding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that combines Labanotation and Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), originally developed for dance, to represent and analyze human motion symbolically. We expand the existing LabanEditor to support full-body annotation and integrate it with AMASS, Mediapipe, and Kinect inputs through a SMPL-based format. Our system supports automatic annotation for the local functional and expressive aspects of motion, and enables bidirectional conversion between symbols and motion. While still a work in progress, this framework lays the groundwork for explainable, expressive motion modeling that can support human-robot interaction, motion preservation, and psychomotor learning systems.",

        "abstract": "Interactive AI chatbots put the power of Large-Language Models (LLMs) into people’s hands; it is this interactivity that fueled explosive worldwide influence. In the generative dance space, however, there are few deep-learning-based generative dance models built with interactivity in mind. The release of the AIST++ dance dataset in 2021 led to an uptick of capabilities in generative dance models. Whether these models could be adapted to support interactivity and how well this approach will work is not known. In this study, we explore the capabilities of existing generative dance models for motion-to-motion synthesis on real-time, full-body motion-captured contemporary dance data. We identify an existing model that we adapted to support interactivity: the Bailando++ model, which is trained on the AIST++ dataset and was modified to take music and a motion sequence as input parameters in an interactive loop. We worked with two professional contemporary choreographers and dancers to record and curate a diverse set of 203 motion-captured dance sequences as a set of \"user inputs\" captured through the Optitrack high-precision motion capture 3D tracking system. We extracted 17 quantitative movement features from the motion data using the well-established Laban Movement Analysis theory, which allowed for quantitative comparisons of inter-movement correlations, which we used for clustering input data and comparing input and output sequences. A total of 10 pieces of music were used to generate a variety of outputs using the adapted Bailando++ model. We found that, on average, the generated output motion achieved only moderate correlations to the user input, with some exceptions of movement and music pairs achieving high correlation. The high-correlation generated output sequences were deemed responsive and relevant co-creations in relation to the input sequences. We discuss implications for interactive generative dance agents, where the use of 3D joint coordinate data should be used over SMPL parameters for ease of real-time generation, and how the use of Laban Movement Analysis could be used to extract useful features and fine-tune deep-learning models.",

The proposed framework consists of three components: a music feature encoder, a pose generator, and a music genre classifier. We focus on integrating these components for generating a realistic 3D human dancing move from music, which can be applied to artificial agents and humanoid robots. The trained dance pose generator, which is a generative autoregressive model, is able to synthesize a dance sequence longer than 1,000 pose frames. Experimental results of generated dance sequences from various songs show how the proposed method generates human-like dancing move to a given music. In addition, a generated 3D dance sequence is applied to a humanoid robot, showing that the proposed framework can make a robot to dance just by listening to music.",

The proposed AIST++ dataset contains 5.2 hours of 3D dance motion in 1408 sequences, covering 10 dance genres with multi-view videos with known camera poses—the largest dataset of this kind to our knowledge. We show that naively applying sequence models such as transformers to this dataset for the task of music conditioned 3D motion generation does not produce satisfactory 3D motion that is well correlated with the input music. We overcome these shortcomings by introducing key changes in its architecture design and supervision: FACT model involves a deep cross-modal transformer block with full-attention that is trained to predict N future motions. We empirically show that these changes are key factors in generating long sequences of realistic dance motion that are well-attuned to the input music. We conduct extensive experiments on AIST++ with user studies, where our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

            "abstract": "Human-AI co-creativity involves humans and AI collaborating on a shared creative product as partners. In a creative collaboration, communication is an essential component among collaborators. In many existing co-creative systems, users can communicate with the AI, usually using buttons or sliders. Typically, the AI in co-creative systems cannot communicate back to humans, limiting their potential to be perceived as partners rather than just a tool. This paper presents a study with 38 participants to explore the impact of two interaction designs, with and without AI-to-human communication, on user engagement, collaborative experience and user perception of a co-creative AI. The study involves user interaction with two prototypes of a co-creative system that contributes sketches as design inspirations during a design task. The results show improved collaborative experience and user engagement with the system incorporating AI-to-human communication. Users perceive co-creative AI as more reliable, personal, and intelligent when the AI communicates to users. The findings can be used to design effective co-creative systems, and the insights can be transferred to other fields involving human-AI interaction and collaboration.",

EDGE uses a transformer-based diffusion model paired with Jukebox, a strong music feature extractor, and confers powerful editing capabilities well-suited to dance, including joint-wise conditioning, and in-betweening. We introduce a new metric for physical plausibility, and evaluate dance quality generated by our method extensively through (1) multiple quantitative metrics on physical plausibility, beat alignment, and diversity benchmarks, and more importantly, (2) a large-scale user study, demonstrating a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.

During two workshop events, experienced dancers explore these expectations through improvisation and role-play, embodying an imagined AI-dancer.

Our findings challenge existing assumptions about what is desired from generative models of dance, such as expectations of realism, and how such systems should be evaluated. We further advocate that such models should celebrate non-human artefacts, focus on the potential for serendipitous moments of discovery, and that dance practitioners should be included in their development. Our concrete suggestions show how our findings can be adapted into the development of improved generative and interactive machine learning models for dancers’ creative practice.",

Bailando++ consists of two components: a choreographic memory that learns to summarize meaningful dancing units from 3D pose sequences, and an actor-critic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) that composes these units into a fluent dance coherent to the music. In particular, to synchronize the diverse motion tempos and music beats, we introduce an actor-critic-based reinforcement learning scheme to the GPT with a novel beat-align reward function. Additionally, we consider learning human dance poses in the rotation domain to avoid body distortions incompatible with human morphology, and introduce a musical contextual encoding to allow the motion GPT to grasp longer-term patterns of music. Our experiments on the standard benchmark show that Bailando++ achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the added benefit of the unsupervised discovery of human-interpretable dancing-style poses in the choreographic memory.",

Unlike existing solo or group dance generation tasks, a duet dance scenario entails a heightened degree of interaction between the two participants, requiring delicate coordination in both pose and position. To support this task, we first build a large-scale and diverse duet interactive dance dataset, DD100, by recording about 117 minutes of professional dancers' performances. To address the challenges inherent in this task, we propose a GPT-based model, Duolando, which autoregressively predicts the subsequent tokenized motion conditioned on the coordinated information of the music, the leader's and the follower's movements. To further enhance the GPT's capabilities of generating stable results on unseen conditions (music and leader motions), we devise an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy that allows the model to explore viable trajectories from out-of-distribution samplings, guided by human-defined rewards. Based on the collected dataset and proposed method, we establish a benchmark with several carefully designed metrics.",

In this paper, we propose a method that can automatically extract motion qualities from dance performances, in terms of Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), for motion analysis and indexing purposes. The main objectives of this study is to analyse the motion information of different dance performances, using the LMA components, and extract those features that are indicative of certain emotions or actions. LMA encodes motions using four components, Body, Effort, Shape and Space, which represent a wide array of structural, geometric, and dynamic features of human motion. A deeper analysis of how these features change on different movements is presented, investigating the correlations between the performers' acting emotional state and its characteristics, thus indicating the importance and the effect of each feature for the classification of the motion. Understanding the quality of the movement helps to apprehend the intentions of the performer, providing a representative search space for indexing motions.",

We use a theory of movement observation (Laban Movement Analysis) to describe movement styles as points in a multi-dimensional perceptual space. We cast the task of learning to synthesize desired movement styles as a regression problem: sequences generated via space-time interpolation of motion capture data are used to learn a nonlinear mapping between animation parameters and movement styles in perceptual space. We demonstrate that the learned model can apply a variety of motion styles to pre-recorded motion sequences and it can extrapolate styles not originally included in the training data.",

On suggere que l'interet grandissant pour le « corps » n'a pas encore permis de theoriser la personne comme agent en mouvement, absente jusqu'a ce jour de la theorie culturelle et des ecrits ethnographiques. On avance l'idee que la nouvelle perspective realiste sur la personne agissante (person and agency) est plus a meme d'offrir les bases philosophiques necessaires a une theorie des acteurs sociaux « dans leur corps », que ne l'est la philosophie existentialiste de Merleau-Ponty. Une fois que les gens sont concus comme des personnes ayant le pouvoir d'executer des actes signifiants a l'aide de signes aussi bien linguistiques que synergiques, le chemin est trace pour developper les strategies necessaires a l'investigation systematique de l'action « incorporee ». Est abordee ensuite la question de l'adoption d'une ecriture du mouvement (Labanotation) qui pourrait se reveler comme etant une ressource methodologique de grand secours, avant d'examiner les methodes utilisees pour enregistrer le langage par signes developpes par les Nord-Amerindiens des plaines. L'A. conclut sur une louange d'Evans-Pritchard pour l'interet ulterieur qu'il porta a l'idee d'un savoir et d'une ecriture du mouvement",

            "abstract": "Les danses de cour, comme la danse baroque en france ou la danse de cour coreenne, assumaient avant tout une fonction politique et sociale. En france comme en coree, leur transmission etait non seulement orale, a l'instar des danses populaires, mais aussi ecrite, grace aux caracteres chinois en coree et au systeme feuillet en france. Elles se pretent donc bien a l'etude. A partir de quels elements est-il possible aujourd'hui de les recreer en restant fidele a l'esprit du passe et en l'integrant a une mise en scene destinee au spectateur d'aujourd'hui ? voici l'objet de notre etude a travers des exemples de la danse baroque francaise et de la danse de cour coreenne. Ces danses sont nees dans le contexte social et politique d'une epoque, ce fait ne peut etre elude. Nous ferons donc notre etude a partir de ce contexte. La danse baroque est l'art du mouvement fonde sur l'alliance d'elements contraires. L'ecriture choregraphique multiplie les axes frontaux et diagonaux. Les directions changeantes du corps du danseur brisent sans cesse les lignes, donnant une sensation de fluidite. Les lignes droites disparaissent sous la profusion des ornements, et, derriere le trace en forme de volute de leurs mouvements arrondis, les danseurs semblent s'evader de ce cadre. La danse baroque invente l'espace imaginaire intemporel. Elle allie une logique cartesienne a une sensualite qui evoque les differents etats passagers de l'ame. En cela la danse baroque est l'art de la passion sublimee. L'esthetique de la danse coreenne est fondee sur son caractere rituel. Cette danse est essentiellement statique. Des pauses interrompent le mouvement du danseur a intervalles reguliers a la maniere d'une ponctuation. La beaute de la danse coreenne reside dans ces arrets qui exercent sur le public une veritable seduction. La danse baroque tout comme la danse de cour coreenne sont deux danses de cour ; il est donc tentant de les comparer, pour en faire ressortir les elements cle, pour mieux les comprendre. Mais tout differe entre ces deux danses : les epoques, l'histoire, les cultures. Notre these se propose de poser quelques jalons pour cette recherche future. Elle degage quelques elements d'approche pour une analyse approfondie d'oeuvres choregraphiques relevant de deux cultures totalement differentes.

        "abstract": "The fact that film became an object of analysis at a time when dance, body culture and life reform movements were on the agenda has received comparatively little attention in film historical scholarship to date. Yet, especially in Germany, gymnastics and modern dance formed an important context that clearly resonated in the debates surrounding the new medium. Not only were the same people—intellectuals, artists and critics—commenting on contemporary events in film and dance, but early film theory and modern dance were also surrounded by similar concerns and inquiries: When is a movement “beautiful”? What makes a body expressive? And which specific forms of a viewer’s aesthetic experience are addressed through movement?",

            "abstract": "Humans use gestures in most communicative acts. How are these gestures initiated and performed? What kinds of communicative roles do they play and what kinds of meanings do they convey? How do listeners extract and understand these meanings? Will it be possible to build computerized communicating agents that can extract and understand the meanings and accordingly simulate and display expressive gestures on the computer in such a way that they can be effective conversational partners? All these questions are easy to ask, but far more difficult to answer. In the thesis we try to address these questions regarding the synthesis and acquisition of communicative gestures. \nOur approach to gesture is based on the principles of movement observation science, specifically Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) and its Effort and Shape components. LMA, developed in the dance community over the past seventy years, is an effective method for observing, describing, notating, and interpreting human movement to enhance communication and expression in everyday and professional life. Its Effort and Shape component provide us with a comprehensive and valuable set of parameters to characterize gesture formation. The computational model (the EMOTE system) we have built offers power and flexibility to procedurally synthesize gestures based on predefined key pose and time information plus Effort and Shape qualities. \nTo provide real quantitative foundations for a complete communicative gesture model, we have built a computational framework where the observable characteristics of gestures—not only key pose and timing but also the underlying motion qualities—can be extracted from live performance, either in 3D motion capture data or in 2D video data, and correlated with observations validated by LMA notators. Experiments of this sort have not been conducted before and should be of interest not only to the computer animation and computer vision community but would be a powerful and valuable methodological tool for creating personalized, communicating agents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Photographs and film recordings have not been commonly used as source material in sports history research. However, every moment and every movement captured in photographs tell us things that researchers could have seen if they had been on the spot when the picture was taken. I suggest that photos and films can be read in the same way as any sign systems, such as writing or maps. The points of departure for my analysis of movement in photographs and film recordings are kinesthetic empathy and the idea that the meanings of most body movements are established to the extent that they are part of our cultural heritage and contain signs and symbols we can relate to. Furthermore, observations made from these documents can be analyzed with the help of theories from other research fields. Using the methods of dance research, such as Rudolf Laban’s movement analysis, Janet Adshead’s dance performance analysis, Marcel Mauss’s habitus concept, and John Martin’s dance analysis, styles, movement languages, and conventions of exercise and sport in photos and films can be identified. In addition, in accordance with photographic research by Roland Barthes, I will reflect on the fringe conditions of the use of photographs as research material, the kind of opportunities they offer, and the kind of limitations they set for the researcher.",

Through readings of works of art and social activism that make use of lynching photographs, this essay considers ways in which photography has functioned as a technology of memory for African Americans, what the essay calls critical black memory, and proffers a mode of historical interpretation that both plays upon and questions photography's documentary capacity. \n \nThe essay makes two claims specifically. First, the mechanical reproduction of lynching by way of the photograph has been central to the recounting and reconstitution of black political cultures throughout the Jim Crow and post-Civil Rights era. From the usage of lynching photography in pamphlets by early twentieth-century anti-lynching activists, to posters created by mid-century civil rights organizations, to their deployment in contemporary art and popular culture, this archive has been a constitutive element of black visuality more broadly. Second, African American engagements with photography as a “site of memory” suggest a mode of historical interpretation in which African Americans simultaneously critique the “truth-claims” of photography while they mobilize the medium's documentary capacity to intervene in the classification and subjugation of black life.",

        "title": "The \"Inter-place\" in Actor Training: Yat Malmgren's Character Analysis",
        "abstract": "Using Henri Bergson’s concept of the human body as an ‘interplace’, an ambiguous ‘place of meeting and transfer’ between materiality and culture, this paper examines the actor training practices of Yat Malmgren. Malmgren’s technique of Character Analysis sets particular movement and vocal patterns for trainee actors to perform, based on its traditional underpinnings from German expressionist dance. Integrating the phenomenologies of Bergson and Merleau-Ponty this paper illustrates the complex modalities of embodied experience inherent in actor training and Malmgren’s training in particular, where actors become keenly aware of corporeal dimensions of expression. Structural elements in the Malmgren technique highlight the chiasmatic relationship for actors of being both the viewed, constructed surface body of contesting discourses, as well as being the viewer, an embodied agency with direction. The resultant ‘excess’ or lack of congruency between these positions enables new movements in physical expression and language, as well as revealing sedimentations of habitual modes of engagement with the world. Malmgren’s emphasis is on otherness. In this actor training context otherness is first experienced as the intertwinement of the actor’s sense of self with the materiality of her own body, reflecting Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy of alterity. The ‘Interplace’ in Actor Training: Yat Malmgren’s Character Analysis I firstly want to introduce myself in this forum as an actor trainer. In the early 1980s I studied at the Drama Centre London training in Yat Malmgren’s technique of Character Analysis. I had worked as an actor previously in Australia and I returned to this after Drama Centre. However my teaching of Malmgren’s technique has become my principal direction. I have taught Malmgren’s technique to actors for 23 years, in independent acting institutions, at the National Institute for Dramatic Arts (NIDA), at the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA) and now the technique is housed at the University of Wollongong’s Faculty of Creative Arts, where I teach it as a component of Performance Skills in a three year Bachelor of Creative Arts Performance degree. Character Analysis, Malmgren’s actor training technique is the subject of my doctorate. I had considered changing the title of this paper. I wanted to call it ‘What Performing Bodies Do.’ simply to emphasise the peculiar and unique position of any performing body, being viewed, being aware of itself being viewed and yet being engrossed in action at the same time. Bruce Wilshire (1991, p. 184), a phenomenologist and performance theorist speaks eloquently about this in his seminal text Role Playing and Identity: The Limits of Theatre as Metaphor. The body that one lives and that is inseparable from oneself enjoys a precarious identity. ... My expressivity is knowable for my own reflection only because initially it is known pre-reflectively through the expressive and responsive bodies of others. It is certainly an odd thing – and that in performance the audience has as much to say about what any performing body is expressing as the body that is doing the performance itself. As Wilshire (1991, p. 232) states, The self is an occasionally conscious body that displays itself in a theatre -like way to others, and the first and third points of view on it are deeply intertwined. Of course writings about performing bodies and the role that others take in shaping performing bodies may not be particularly helpful to the performer in the act of performance itself. I thought we could play a performative game here. Let’s take me, my performative role here– I’m a performing body in this instance. You and I know all sorts of things about performing bodies. I know that Foucault (cited in Butler, 1999, p. 308) has said that my bodily surface is a web of contestations of ideologies set historically. I am a set of bodily inscriptions that you as my audience are reading. So? What? What am I to you? I am a white female academic – no that’s right I’ve announced myself as an acting teacher – I’m a white, middle aged female acting teacher – or I’m an Australian in New Zealand – or perhaps I’m at the wrong conference because I am primarily a theatre practitioner and perhaps not an academic at all! These are definitely contexts. Moreover there are many contexts that you are reading that I am unaware of even as I am in action. And they definitely do shape viewings of whatever I am up to here. But I am also an experiencing body and there is a negotiation in process between your context for me (whatever that might be!) and my subjective positioning of myself (though specific to this temporality and space). This brings me to the real title of my paper –‘The ‘interplace’ in actor training’. This term, ‘interplace’, is originally Henri Bergson’s (cited in Casey, 1998, p. 213), an early phenomenologist investigating consciousness and its role in memory. Edward Casey, in 1998, used Bergson’s term in a paper about embodiment entitled, ‘The ghost of embodiment: on bodily habitudes and schemata.’ Casey to a certain extent aligns his position with Bordieu in the paper. He develops the concept that any learned bodily movement demonstrates the ‘quasi-technical’ (1998, p. 210) ability of the human body as an ‘intermediacy’, a ‘meeting’ place between the ‘cultural’ and ‘physical’. Quoting Casey’s (1998, p. 213) paper, he argues as such an inter-place, the lived body lends itself to cultural enactments of the most varied sorts, all of which are themselves dependent on particular corporeal techniques for their own realization. Of course if I stand here then I must have used the ‘apparatus’ of my body to construct this paper, I must be applying ‘the apparatus’ which is my body to face you, to speak audibly, to read. But Casey himself dismantles the notion that any body can be considered as apparatus. It seems that as well as being the rather objectified image of Foucault’s ‘regime’ (cited in Casey 1998, p. 213) I also stand here as Casey’s ‘interplace’ having gained a set of performative skills, practiced and shaped through time, whilst being conscious of my corporeal involvement in the adjustment and enactment of those skills; my vocal qualities, my stance, my impact, my relatedness, these are corporeally involved dimensions to my surface representations. This notion of ‘the inter-place’ is directly applicable to Australian actor – training and it forms the background for my discussion today, a questioning of actor training and who it serves, as well as an introduction to Yat Malmgren’s Character Analysis. The skills acquisition which takes place in actor trainings in Australia throughout post schooling institutions whether within Universities, TAFEs (Australia’s Technical and Further Education system) or independent acting schools, are corporeally embedded learning processes that whilst having varying cultural heritages are learnt viscerally. My doctoral thesis tracks just some of these skills trainings (Hayes, 2008, p. 126), indicating for instance the background of methods and influences that Tony Knight brings to his acting teaching at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts (NIDA) which is Australia’s premiere acting institution. Knight states in an article in the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance publication of Equity (Mill, 2002, p. 16), that his principal influences in his teachings are Stella Adler’s Stanislavskian method of training actors and Rudolf Laban’s movement theories as expressed by Yat Malmgren. In comparison the heritage of techniques that Lindy Davies brought to her years of teaching and directing at the Victorian College of the Arts are quite different (Woollard, 2002, p. 43). Davies speaks of Balinese trance, of the influence of Peter Brook’s techniques and Grotowski. Jane Woollard (2002 p. 43) writing in RealTime about actor training in Australia has argued that a ‘geanealogy of method’ prevails at institutions where, like an apprenticeship model, the acting techniques offered at any one institution are the techniques in which each teacher has been trained. She indicates that training institutions’ curricula have on the whole been formed by their staff. This is the case in my own department at the University of Wollongong’s School of Music and Drama, where staff create their curriculum and where each staff member brings to that their own heritage of how they themselves were trained. My use of the term ‘inter-place’ through my added introduction of Wilshire, and his reference to identity, begs a more probing question than simply the cultural heritage of actor trainings. – What role does the identity of the performer have in shaping her own expressivity within any actor training institution? For although performance skills form the backbone of an actor training, the notion of what a body is or may be or the questioning of how expression is shaped through a human body remains primarily an unconscious rather than conscious negotiation. Each training method was created historically for a purpose, which may no longer be pertinent. Malmgren’s Character Analysis was created over his time at the Drama Centre, London, where he was the co-director of the institution with Christopher Fettes from 1963 until 2001. Malmgren was born in Sweden 1916 and lived until 2002. He retired from teaching Character Analysis at Drama Centre, London in 2001 at the age of 85. Malmgren wrote nothing of his work. In this latter half of his life he behaved as an introvert who taught principally from one room. He did not collaborate on the many theatrical productions staged at Drama Centre. Yet he is referred to as being a seminal influence on numbers of famous British and International actors, Sean Connery, Diane Cilento, Anthony Hopkins, Anne-Marie Duff, John Simm, Pearce Brosnan, Colin Firth – the list goes on and on. The technique of Character Analysis rests on a body of work entrusted to Malmgren by Rudolf Laban, th",
