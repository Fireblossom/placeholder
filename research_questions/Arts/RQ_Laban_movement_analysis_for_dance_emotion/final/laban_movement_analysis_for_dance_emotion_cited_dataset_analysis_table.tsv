AMASS	https://doi.org/10.1145/3708319.3734180	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2019.00554	The AMASS dataset is used to aggregate and standardize motion capture data into the SMPL format, facilitating Laban Movement Analysis for dance emotion research. It supports deep learning processing and integrates with motion capture inputs for analysis and generation, often using joint detection algorithms. This enables researchers to focus on deep learning applications and video inputs, enhancing the accuracy and scope of movement analysis and synthesis.
LMA features	https://doi.org/10.1002/cav.1714	https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b905d40d50724f65adf0ca20a51a3a801637679	The 'LMA features' dataset is used to analyze Laban movement analysis in relation to emotional expression. Researchers focus on the correlation between specific movement features and mood ratings, employing methodologies that quantify these relationships. This dataset enables the exploration of how particular movements are associated with different emotional states, contributing to the understanding of non-verbal communication and emotional expression in movement.
