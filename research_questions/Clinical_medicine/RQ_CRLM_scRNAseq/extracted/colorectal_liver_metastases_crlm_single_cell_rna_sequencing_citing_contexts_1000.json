        "title": "Hyperglycemia induces an immunosuppressive microenvironment in colorectal cancer liver metastases by recruiting peripheral blood monocytes through the CCL3-CCR1 axis",
        "abstract": "Background The treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), a leading cause of mortality in patients with colorectal cancer, is complicated by type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to investigate the CRLM immune microenvironment in the context of T2D and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods A hyperglycemic CRLM mouse model was established. Seven single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed, including three peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) datasets (from healthy donors and T2D patients) and four datasets with 20 CRLM samples and matching PBMCs datasets, to explore the immune characteristics and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment in CRLM with concurrent T2D. Results CD8+T cells exhibited dysfunction and exhaustion in liver metastasis from patients with CRLM and T2D; the proportions of various CD4+T cell subpopulations were also altered, and the number of myeloid cells and their function was increased. Myeloid cells in CRLM from patients with T2D exhibited high expression levels of CCL3, which recruited peripheral blood monocytes expressing high levels of CCR1, leading to an accumulation of myeloid cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Recruited cells exhibited enhanced T cell communication abilities, indicating an augmented immunosuppressive capacity. In addition, CCR1 expression in peripheral blood monocytes from patients with CRLM was closely correlated with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, suggesting that CCR1 expression levels may predict immune cell phenotype and prognosis in patients with CRLM and T2D. Conclusions Our study revealed complex changes in the tumor microenvironment of patients with CRLM and T2D. In particular, a novel mechanism was identified by which hyperglycemia regulates immunosuppression: the CCL3–CCR1 signaling axis. This finding offers a novel potential therapeutic target for patients with CRLM and T2D and provides an important theoretical basis for the future prediction of the prognosis of these patients.",

However, the effect of hyperglycemia on hepatic immunity remains obscure. We evaluated the population and function of hepatic immune cells in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced hyperglycemic mice. CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-knockout mice and mice with a depletion of regulatory T cells (DEREG) were used to investigate the migration and role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in hyperglycemic mice. The inflammatory cytokines and hepatic transaminase levels were significantly increased in the hyperglycemic mice. The population and number of infiltrating monocytes, granulocytes, and Tregs were enhanced in the livers of the hyperglycemic mice. Hepatic monocytes other than macrophages showed the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the hyperglycemic mice. The CCR2 knockout and DEREG chimeric mice exhibited increased populations of activated T cells and neutrophils compared to the WT chimeric mice, which promoted hepatic inflammation in the hyperglycemic mice. The migration of CCR2 knockout Tregs into the liver was significantly reduced compared to the WT Tregs. We demonstrated that hyperglycemia contributes to increase in infiltrating monocytes and Tregs, which are associated with hepatic immune dysfunction in mice. CCR2-mediated migration of Tregs regulates hyperglycemia-induced hepatic inflammation.",

            "abstract": "Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.",

            "abstract": "Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) maintain host self-tolerance but are a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy. Treg cells subvert beneficial anti-tumor immunity by modulating inhibitory receptor expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); however, the underlying mediators and mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we found that the cytokines IL-10 and IL-35 (Ebi3–IL-12α heterodimer) were divergently expressed by Treg cell subpopulations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and cooperatively promoted intratumoral T cell exhaustion by modulating several inhibitory receptor expression and exhaustion-associated transcriptomic signature of CD8+ TILs. While expression of BLIMP1 (encoded by Prdm1) was a common target, IL-10 and IL-35 differentially affected effector T cell versus memory T cell fates, respectively, highlighting their differential, partially overlapping but non-redundant regulation of anti-tumor immunity. Our results reveal previously unappreciated cooperative roles for Treg cell-derived IL-10 and IL-35 in promoting BLIMP1-dependent exhaustion of CD8+ TILs that limits effective anti-tumor immunity. Regulatory T cells obstruct effective anti-cancer immune responses. Vignali and colleagues demonstrate that IL-10 production and IL-35 production by tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells mediate differential and non-redundant suppressive effects on tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells.",

            "abstract": "Understanding global communications among cells requires accurate representation of cell-cell signaling links and effective systems-level analyses of those links. We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (http://www.cellchat.org/) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues. Single-cell methods record molecule expressions of cells in a given tissue, but understanding interactions between cells remains challenging. Here the authors show by applying systems biology and machine learning approaches that they can infer and analyze cell-cell communication networks in an easily interpretable way.",

            "abstract": "Tumors evade immune-mediated recognition through multiple mechanisms of immune escape. On chronic tumor antigen exposure, T cells become dysfunctional/exhausted and upregulate various checkpoint inhibitory receptors (IRs) that limit T cells’ survival and function. During the last decade, immunotherapies targeting IRs such as programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and anticytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have provided ample evidence of clinical benefits in many solid tumors. Beyond CTLA-4 and PD-1, multiple other IRs are also targeted with immune checkpoint blockade in the clinic. Specifically, T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is a promising new target for cancer immunotherapy. TIGIT is upregulated by immune cells, including activated T cells, natural killer cells, and regulatory T cells. TIGIT binds to two ligands, CD155 (PVR) and CD112 (PVRL2, nectin-2), that are expressed by tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment. There is now ample evidence that the TIGIT pathway regulates T cell-mediated and natural killer cell-mediated tumor recognition in vivo and in vitro. Dual PD-1/TIGIT blockade potently increases tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cell expansion and function in vitro and promotes tumor rejection in mouse tumor models. These findings support development of ongoing clinical trials with dual PD-1/TIGIT blockade in patients with cancer.",

            "abstract": "Background The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a dynamic system orchestrated by intricate cell-to-cell crosstalk. Specifically, macrophages within the TME play a crucial role in driving tumor progression. Exosomes are key mediators of communication between tumor cells and the TME. However, the mechanisms underlying exosome-driven crosstalk between tumor cells and macrophages during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression remain incompletely elucidated. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing were analyzed using the Seurat package. Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blot. miRNAs differentially expressed in exosomes were analyzed using the limma package. CD206 expression in CRC tissues, exosomes tracing, and exosomal miR-106a-5p transport were observed through immunofluorescence. Macrophage polarization was assessed via qRT-PCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The interactions between miR-106a-5p, hnRNPA1, and SOCS6 were evaluated using miRNA pull-down, RIP, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Transwell assays and liver metastasis model explored the role of exosomal miR-106a-5p-induced M2 macrophages in promoting CRC liver metastasis. Result The proportion of M2 macrophages is increased in CRC with liver metastasis compared to those without. Highly metastatic CRC cells release exosomes enriched with miR-106a-5p, which promote macrophages M2 polarization by suppressing SOCS6 and activating JAK2/STAT3 pathway. These M2 macrophages reciprocally enhance CRC liver metastasis. hnRNPA1 regulate the transport of miR-106a-5p into exosomes. Clinically, elevated miR-106a-5p in plasma exosomes correlated with liver metastasis and poor prognosis. Conclusion CRC-derived exosomal miR-106a-5p plays a critical role in promoting liver metastasis and is a potential biomarker for the prevention and treatment of CRC liver metastasis.

        "abstract": "Rationale: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exhibit diverse functions, yet their roles in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) remain poorly understood. Methods: Through integrated analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics from colorectal cancer patients (CRCP: non-metastatic primary tumors; CRCM: metastatic primary tumors with liver metastases), combined with in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the role of CAFs in CRLM. In vitro experiments included six groups to reveal the role of SFRP1-producing CAFs, comprising PBS (control) and recombinant human SFRP1 (rhSFRP1) treated SW480 cells, PBS (control) and recombinant mouse SFRP1 (rmSFRP1) treated CT26 cells, and conditioned medium (CM) derived from CAF-NC and CAF-Sfrp1 treated CT26 cells. Preclinical models were further employed to elucidate the role of SFRP1 in CRLM. Subcutaneous xenografts models were constructed from PBS (control) and rhSFRP1 treated SW480 cells. For orthotopic tumor metastasis models, CT26 cells were pre-cultured with CAF-NC or CAF-Sfrp1 and then orthotopically injected into BALB/c mice. Results: We identified an inflammatory CAF subtype (CFD+ iCAFs) associated with poor clinical outcomes, advanced staging, and metastasis. Transcriptional regulation analysis revealed FOS-mediated differentiation of CFD+ iCAFs drives SFRP1 overexpression. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that SFRP1-producing CAFs promote tumor stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, SFRP1 from CFD+ iCAFs binds FGFR2, activating the HIF1 signaling pathway to enhance tumor stemness, EMT, and CRLM progression. Conclusion: This study highlights CFD+ iCAFs as key regulators of tumor-stromal interactions and identifies SFRP1 as a potential therapeutic target in CRLM.",

            "abstract": "Cancer is a disease of ageing. Clinically, aged cancer patients tend to have a poorer prognosis than young. This may be due to accumulated cellular damage, decreases in adaptive immunity, and chronic inflammation. However, the effects of the aged microenvironment on tumour progression have been largely unexplored. Since dermal fibroblasts can have profound impacts on melanoma progression, we examined whether age-related changes in dermal fibroblasts could drive melanoma metastasis and response to targeted therapy. Here we find that aged fibroblasts secrete a Wnt antagonist, sFRP2, which activates a multi-step signalling cascade in melanoma cells that results in a decrease in β-catenin and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and ultimately the loss of a key redox effector, APE1. Loss of APE1 attenuates the response of melanoma cells to DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species, rendering the cells more resistant to targeted therapy (vemurafenib). Age-related increases in sFRP2 also augment both angiogenesis and metastasis of melanoma cells. These data provide an integrated view of how fibroblasts in the aged microenvironment contribute to tumour progression, offering new possibilities for the design of therapy for the elderly.",

            "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is poorly responsive to therapies and histologically contains a paucity of neoplastic cells embedded within a dense desmoplastic stroma. Within the stroma, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) secrete tropic factors and extracellular matrix components, and have been implicated in PDAC progression and chemotherapy resistance. We recently identified two distinct CAF subtypes characterized by either myofibroblastic or inflammatory phenotypes; however, the mechanisms underlying their diversity and their roles in PDAC remain unknown. Here, we use organoid and mouse models to identify TGFβ and IL1 as tumor-secreted ligands that promote CAF heterogeneity. We show that IL1 induces LIF expression and downstream JAK/STAT activation to generate inflammatory CAFs and demonstrate that TGFβ antagonizes this process by downregulating IL1R1 expression and promoting differentiation into myofibroblasts. Our results provide a mechanism through which distinct fibroblast niches are established in the PDAC microenvironment and illuminate strategies to selectively target CAFs that support tumor growth. SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the mechanisms that determine CAF heterogeneity in PDAC is a prerequisite for the rational development of approaches that selectively target tumor-promoting CAFs. Here, we identify an IL1-induced signaling cascade that leads to JAK/STAT activation and promotes an inflammatory CAF state, suggesting multiple strategies to target these cells in vivo.

We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells. CIBERSORTx, a suite of computational tools, enables inference of cell type abundance and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk RNA profiles.",

            "abstract": "More diversity at the top A detailed knowledge of cell differentiation hierarchies is important for understanding diverse biological processes such as organ development, tissue regeneration, and cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing can help elucidate these hierarchies, but it requires reliable computational methods for predicting cell lineage trajectories. Gulati et al. developed CytoTRACE, a computational framework based on the simple observation that transcriptional diversity—the number of genes expressed in a cell—decreases during differentiation. CytoTRACE outperformed other methods in several test cases and was successfully applied to study cellular hierarchies in healthy and tumor tissue. Science, this issue p. 405 The number of expressed genes per cell is the foundation of a method that can resolve cell differentiation hierarchies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful approach for reconstructing cellular differentiation trajectories. However, inferring both the state and direction of differentiation is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple, yet robust, determinant of developmental potential—the number of expressed genes per cell—and leverage this measure of transcriptional diversity to develop a computational framework (CytoTRACE) for predicting differentiation states from scRNA-seq data. When applied to diverse tissue types and organisms, CytoTRACE outperformed previous methods and nearly 19,000 annotated gene sets for resolving 52 experimentally determined developmental trajectories. Additionally, it facilitated the identification of quiescent stem cells and revealed genes that contribute to breast tumorigenesis. This study thus establishes a key RNA-based feature of developmental potential and a platform for delineation of cellular hierarchies.",

These include limitations in our understanding of the origin of CAFs and heterogeneity in CAF function, with it being desirable to retain some antitumorigenic functions. On the basis of a meeting of experts in the field of CAF biology, we summarize in this Consensus Statement our current knowledge and present a framework for advancing our understanding of this critical cell type within the tumour microenvironment. This Consensus Statement highlights the importance of cancer-associated fibroblasts in cancer biology and progression, and issues a call to action for all cancer researchers to standardize assays and report metadata in studies of cancer-associated fibroblasts to advance our understanding of this important cell type in the tumour microenvironment.",

We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (http://www.cellchat.org/) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues. Single-cell methods record molecule expressions of cells in a given tissue, but understanding interactions between cells remains challenging. Here the authors show by applying systems biology and machine learning approaches that they can infer and analyze cell-cell communication networks in an easily interpretable way.",

The application of integrated omics to exploring robust signatures for clinical translation is increasingly highlighted, attributed to the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade in diverse malignancies. However, effective tools to comprehensively interpret multi-omics data is still warranted to provide increased granularity into intrinsic mechanism of oncogenesis and immunotherapeutic sensitivity. Results We developed a computational tool for effective Immuno-Oncology Biological Research (IOBR), providing comprehensive investigation of estimation of reported or user-built signatures, TME deconvolution and signature construction base on multi-omics data. Notably, IOBR offers batch analyses of these signatures and their correlations with clinical phenotypes, lncRNA profiling, genomic characteristics and signatures generated from single-cell RNA sequencing data in different cancer settings. Additionally, IOBR also integrates multiple existing microenvironmental deconvolution methodologies and signature construction tools for convenient comparison and selection. Collectively, IOBR is a user-friendly tool, to leverage multi-omics data to facilitate immuno-oncology exploration and unveiling of tumor-immune interactions and accelerating precision immunotherapy.",

Single-cell characterization of CMS subtype tumor microenvironments is required to elucidate mechanisms of tumor and stroma cell contributions to pathogenesis which may advance subtype-specific therapeutic development. We interrogate racially diverse human CRC samples and analyze multiple independent external cohorts for a total of 487,829 single cells enabling high-resolution depiction of the cellular diversity and heterogeneity within the tumor and microenvironmental cells. Results Tumor cells recapitulate individual CMS subgroups yet exhibit significant intratumoral CMS heterogeneity. Both CMS1 microsatellite instability (MSI-H) CRCs and microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC demonstrate similar pathway activations at the tumor epithelial level. However, CD8+ cytotoxic T cell phenotype infiltration in MSI-H CRCs may explain why these tumors respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Cellular transcriptomic profiles in CRC exist in a tumor immune stromal continuum in contrast to discrete subtypes proposed by studies utilizing bulk transcriptomics. We note a dichotomy in tumor microenvironments across CMS subgroups exists by which patients with high cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and C1Q+TAM content exhibit poor outcomes, providing a higher level of personalization and precision than would distinct subtypes. Additionally, we discover CAF subtypes known to be associated with immunotherapy resistance. Conclusions Distinct CAFs and C1Q+ TAMs are sufficient to explain CMS predictive ability and a simpler signature based on these cellular phenotypes could stratify CRC patient prognosis with greater precision. Therapeutically targeting specific CAF subtypes and C1Q + TAMs may promote immunotherapy responses in CRC patients.",

            "abstract": "Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are important in tumor microenvironment (TME) driven cancer progression. However, CAFs are heterogeneous and still largely underdefined, better understanding their origins will identify new therapeutic strategies for cancer. Here, the authors discovered a new role of macrophage‐myofibroblast transition (MMT) in cancer for de novo generating protumoral CAFs by resolving the transcriptome dynamics of tumor‐associated macrophages (TAM) with single‐cell resolution. MMT cells (MMTs) are observed in non‐small‐cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) associated with CAF abundance and patient mortality. By fate‐mapping study, RNA velocity, and pseudotime analysis, existence of novel macrophage‐lineage‐derived CAF subset in the TME of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model is confirmed, which is directly transited via MMT from M2‐TAM in vivo and bone‐marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDM) in vitro. Adoptive transfer of BMDM‐derived MMTs markedly promote CAF formation in LLC‐bearing mice. Mechanistically, a Smad3‐centric regulatory network is upregulated in the MMTs of NSCLC, where chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing(ChIP‐seq) detects a significant enrichment of Smad3 binding on fibroblast differentiation genes in the macrophage‐lineage cells in LLC‐tumor. More importantly, macrophage‐specific deletion and pharmaceutical inhibition of Smad3 effectively block MMT, therefore, suppressing the CAF formation and cancer progression in vivo. Thus, MMT may represent a novel therapeutic target of CAF for cancer immunotherapy.",

            "abstract": "Introduction Mounting evidence has revealed that the interactions and dynamic alterations among immune cells are critical in shaping the tumor microenvironment and ultimately map onto heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Currently, the underlying clinical significance of immune cell evolutions remains largely unexplored in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods A total of 3,817 immune cells and 1,750 HCC patients of 15 independent public datasets were retrieved. The Seurat and Monocle algorithms were used to depict T cell evolution, and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was further applied to identify the molecular classification. Subsequently, the prognosis, biological characteristics, genomic variations, and immune landscape among distinct clusters were decoded. The clinical efficacy of multiple treatment approaches was further investigated. Results According to trajectory gene expression, three heterogeneous clusters with different clinical outcomes were identified. C2, with a more advanced pathological stage, presented the most dismal prognosis relative to C1 and C3. Eight independent external cohorts validated the robustness and reproducibility of the three clusters. Further explorations elucidated C1 to be characterized as lipid metabolic HCC, and C2 was referred to as cell-proliferative HCC, whereas C3 was defined as immune inflammatory HCC. Moreover, C2 also displayed the most conspicuous genomic instability, and C3 was deemed as “immune-hot”, having abundant immune cells and an elevated expression of immune checkpoints. The assessments of therapeutic intervention suggested that patients in C1 were suitable for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization treatment, and patients in C2 were sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while patients in C3 were more responsive to immunotherapy. We also identified numerous underlying therapeutic agents, which might be conducive to clinical transformation in the future. Conclusions Our study developed three clusters with distinct characteristics based on immune cell evolutions. For specifically stratified patients, we proposed individualized treatment strategies to improve the clinical outcomes and facilitate the clinical management.",

            "abstract": "Background Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for approximately 50% of heart failure cases. The molecular mechanisms by which HFpEF leads to impaired diastolic function of the heart have not been clarified, nor have the drugs that target the clinical symptoms of HFpEF patients. Methods HFpEF chip data (GSE180065) was downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered by the limma package in R and processed for GO and KEGG pathway analyses. Then, ferroptosis-related genes in HFpEF were identified by taking the intersection between DEGs and ferroptosis-related genes. CytoHubba and MCODE were used to screen ferroptosis-related hub DEGs in the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. Establishment of a mouse HFpEF model to validate the transcript levels of ferroptosis-related hub DEGs and ferroptosis-related phenotypes. Transcript levels of ferroptosis-related hub DEGs and HFpEF phenotypic changes in the hearts of HFpEF mice were further examined after the use of ferroptosis inhibitors. Results GO and KEGG enrichment analyses suggested that the DEGs in HFpEF were significantly enriched in ferroptosis-related pathways. A total of 24 ferroptosis-related DEGs were identified between the ferroptosis gene dataset and the DEGs. The established PPI network was further analyzed by CytoHubba and MCODE modules, and 11 ferroptosis-related hub DEGs in HFpEF were obtained. In animal experiments, HFpEF mice showed significant abnormal activation of ferroptosis. The expression trends of the 11 hub DEGs associated with ferroptosis, except for Cdh1, were consistent with the results of the bioinformatics analysis. Inhibition of ferroptosis alters the transcript levels of 11 ferroptosis-related hub DEGs and ameliorates HFpEF phenotypes. Conclusions The present study contributes to a deeper understanding of the specific mechanisms by which ferroptosis is involved in the development of HFpEF and suggests that inhibition of ferroptosis may mitigate the progression of HFpEF. In addition, eleven hub genes were recognized as potential drug binding targets.

            "abstract": "The cascade of metastasis in tumor cells, exhibiting organ-specific tendencies, may occur at numerous phases of the disease and progress under intense evolutionary pressures. Organ-specific metastasis relies on the formation of pre-metastatic niche (PMN), with diverse cell types and complex cell interactions contributing to this concept, adding a new dimension to the traditional metastasis cascade. Prior to metastatic dissemination, as orchestrators of PMN formation, primary tumor-derived extracellular vesicles prepare a fertile microenvironment for the settlement and colonization of circulating tumor cells at distant secondary sites, significantly impacting cancer progression and outcomes. Obviously, solely intervening in cancer metastatic sites passively after macrometastasis is often insufficient. Early prediction of metastasis and holistic, macro-level control represent the future directions in cancer therapy. This review emphasizes the dynamic and intricate systematic alterations that occur as cancer progresses, illustrates the immunological landscape of organ-specific PMN creation, and deepens understanding of treatment modalities pertinent to metastasis, thereby identifying some prognostic and predictive biomarkers favorable to early predict the occurrence of metastasis and design appropriate treatment combinations.",

Methods Single-cell analysis highlighted a notable increase in myCAFs in colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM). Exosomal sequencing identified PWAR6 as the most significantly elevated lncRNA in these metastatic tissues. In vivo and in vitro assays confirmed PWAR6's roles in CRC cell stemness, migration, and glutamine uptake. RNA pulldown, RIP, and Co-IP assays investigated the molecular mechanisms of the PWAR6/NRF2/SLC38A2 signaling axis in CRC progression, flow cytometry was used to assess NK cell activity and cytotoxicity. Results Clinically, higher PWAR6 expression levels are strongly associated with increased 68Ga FAPI-PET/CT SUVmax values, particularly in CRLM patients, where expression significantly exceeds that of non-LM cases and normal colon tissues. Regression analysis and survival data further support PWAR6 as a negative prognostic marker, with elevated levels correlating with worse patient outcomes. Mechanistically, PWAR6 promotes immune evasion by inhibiting NRF2 degradation through competitive binding with Keap1, thereby upregulating SLC38A2 expression, which enhances glutamine uptake in CRC cells and depletes glutamine availability for NK cells. Conclusion myCAFs derived exosomes PWAR6 represents a pivotal marker for CRC liver metastasis, and its targeted inhibition with ASO-PWAR6, in combination with FAPI treatment, effectively curtails metastasis in preclinical models, offering promising therapeutic potential for clinical management.

            "abstract": "The tumor stroma, which accounts for a large part of the tumor mass, represents an attractive target for the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic compounds. Here, the focus is notably on a subpopulation of stromal cells, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts, which are present in more than 90% of epithelial carcinomas, including pancreatic, colon, and breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts feature high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is not detectable in adult normal tissue but is associated with a poor prognosis in cancer patients. Methods: We developed an iodinated and a DOTA-coupled radiotracer based on a FAP-specific enzyme inhibitor (FAPI) and evaluated them in vitro using uptake, competition, and efflux studies as well as confocal microscopy of a fluorescence-labeled variant. Furthermore, we performed imaging and biodistribution studies on tumor-bearing animals. Finally, proof of concept was realized by imaging patients with 68Ga-labeled FAPI. Results: Both FAPIs showed high specificity, affinity, and rapid internalization into FAP-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. Biodistribution studies on tumor-bearing mice and on the first cancer patients demonstrated high intratumoral uptake of the tracer and fast body clearance, resulting in high-contrast images and negligible exposure of healthy tissue to radiation. A comparison with the commonly used radiotracer 18F-FDG in a patient with locally advanced lung adenocarcinoma revealed that the new FAP ligand was clearly superior. Conclusion: Radiolabeled FAPIs allow fast imaging with very high contrast in tumors having a high stromal content and may therefore serve as pantumor agents. Coupling of these molecules to DOTA or other chelators allows labeling not only with 68Ga but also with therapeutic isotopes such as 177Lu or 90Y.",

Current efforts to eradicate CRC predominantly focused on targeting the proliferation of rapidly growing cancer epithelial cells. This is largely ineffective with resistance arising in most tumors after exposure to chemotherapy. Despite the long‐standing recognition of the crosstalk between carcinoma‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment, how CAFs may contribute to drug resistance in neighboring cancer cells is not well characterized. Here, we show that lncRNA CCAL (colorectal cancer‐associated lncRNA) promotes oxaliplatin (Oxa) resistance of CRC cells. RNA‐ISH shows higher CCAL expressed in the tumor stroma compared to cancer nests of CRC tissues. Functional studies reveal that CCAL is transferred from CAFs to the cancer cells via exosomes, where it suppresses CRC cell apoptosis, confers chemoresistance and activates β‐catenin pathway in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CCAL interacts directly with mRNA stabilizing protein HuR (human antigen R) to increase β‐catenin mRNA and protein levels. Our findings indicate that CCAL expressed by CAFs of the colorectal tumor stroma contributes to tumor chemoresistance and CCAL may serve as a potential therapeutic target for Oxa resistance.",

Here we investigated the biological consequences of these co-occurring alterations and explored whether they conferred specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Compared with KL tumors, KLK tumors exhibited increased expression of genes involved in glutamine metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the redox homeostasis signature. Using isogenic pairs with knockdown or overexpression of LKB1, KEAP1, and NRF2, we found that LKB1 loss results in increased energetic and redox stress marked by increased levels of intracellular ROS and decreased levels of ATP, NADPH/NADP+ ratio, and glutathione. Activation of the KEAP1/NRF2 axis in LKB1-deficient cells enhanced cell survival and played a critical role in the maintenance of energetic and redox homeostasis in a glutamine-dependent manner. LKB1 and the KEAP1/NRF2 pathways cooperatively drove metabolic reprogramming and enhanced sensitivity to the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 in vitro and in vivo. Overall, these findings elucidate the adaptive advantage provided by KEAP1/NRF2 pathway activation in KL tumors and support clinical testing of glutaminase inhibitor in subsets of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.",

Mechanisms underlying the pre-metastatic niche formation are poorly understood. Here we show that in a colorectal cancer (CRC) model, primary tumors release integrin beta-like 1 (ITGBL1)-rich extracellular vesicles (EVs) to the circulation to activate resident fibroblasts in remote organs. The activated fibroblasts induce the pre-metastatic niche formation and promote metastatic cancer growth by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as IL-6 and IL-8. Mechanistically, the primary CRC-derived ITGBL1-enriched EVs stimulate the TNFAIP3-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway to activate fibroblasts. Consequently, the activated fibroblasts produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines to promote metastatic cancer growth. These findings uncover a tumor–stromal interaction in the metastatic tumor microenvironment and an intimate signaling communication between primary tumors and metastases through the ITGBL1-loaded EVs. Targeting the EVs-ITGBL1-CAFs-TNFAIP3-NF-κB signaling axis provides an attractive approach for treating metastatic diseases. Mechanisms regulating the formation of pre-metastatic niches remain poorly understood. Here, the authors show that ITGBL1-containing extracellular vesicles derived from primary colorectal cancer cells activate the production of inflammatory cytokines by resident fibroblasts in distant organs, promoting metastatic cancer growth.",

Here, we generated paired organoids derived from primary tumors and matched liver metastases in the same colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Despite the fact that paired organoids exhibit comparable gene expression and cell morphology, organoids from metastatic lesions demonstrate more aggressive phenotypes, tumorigenesis, and metastatic capacity than those from primary lesions. Transcriptional analyses of the paired organoids reveal signature genes and pathways altered during the progression of CRC, including SOX2. Further study shows that inducible knockdown of SOX2 attenuated invasion, proliferation, and liver metastasis outgrowth. Taken together, we use patient-derived paired primary and metastatic cancer organoids to model CRC metastasis and illustrate that SOX2 is associated with CRC progression and may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of CRC.",

            "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is reported to be one of the hallmarks of cancer, which is an adaptive mechanism by which fast-growing cancer cells adapt to their increasing energy demands. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) known as exosomes have been recognized as crucial signaling mediators in regulating the tumor microenvironment (TME). Meanwhile, the TME is a highly heterogeneous ecosystem incorporating cancer cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and extracellular matrix. Accumulated evidence indicates that exosomes may transfer biologically functional molecules to the recipient cells, which facilitate cancer progression, angiogenesis, metastasis, drug resistance, and immunosuppression by reprogramming the metabolism of cancer cells and their surrounding stromal cells. In this review, we present the role of exosomes in the TME and the underlying mechanism of how exosomes exacerbate tumor development through metabolic reprogramming. In addition, we will also discuss the potential role of exosomes targeting metabolic process as biomarkers for tumor diagnosis and prognosis, and exosomes-mediated metabolic reprogramming as potential targets for cancer therapy. Furthermore, a better understanding of the link between exosomes and metabolic reprogramming, and their impact on cancer progression, would provide novel insights for cancer prevention and treatment in the future.",

Mounting evidence suggests that exosomes participate in intercellular communication and act as important molecular vehicles in the regulation of numerous physiological and pathological processes, including cancer development. Exosomes are released by various cell types under both normal and pathological conditions, and they can be found in multiple bodily fluids. Moreover, exosomes carrying a wide variety of important macromolecules provide a window into altered cellular or tissue states. Their presence in biological fluids renders them an attractive, minimally invasive approach for liquid biopsies with potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prediction, and surveillance. Due to their biocompatibility and low immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, exosomes have potential clinical applications in the development of innovative therapeutic approaches. Here, we summarize recent advances in various technologies for exosome isolation for cancer research. We outline the functions of exosomes in regulating tumor metastasis, drug resistance, and immune modulation in the context of cancer development. Finally, we discuss prospects and challenges for the clinical development of exosome-based liquid biopsies and therapeutics.",

Fibroblasts, which are the main cell type within the stroma and are called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), orchestrate the crosstalk with cancer cells [2, 3] and express several markers associated with prognosis [4]. There is increasing evidence that a stromaspecific signature could be used for risk assessment in colon cancer (CC). According to the Consensus Molecular Subtype classification (CMS) in CC, the mesenchymal or CMS4 group is characterized by stromal invasion, extracellular matrix remodeling and TGF-β signaling activation. It is associated with the worst prognosis rates [5, 6]. Genes correlating with the mesenchymal subtype are mostly expressed by CAFs and other stromal cells, rather than by tumor cells [7]. Accordingly, our group defined a gene expression profile associated with CAFs with high pro-migratory effects on colon tumor cells, which was associated with patients’ poor prognosis. These were mostly advanced-stage patients [8]. The crosstalk between tumor and stromal cells is conducted in part by exosomes that are involved in many tumorogenic processes. ncRNAs contained in exosomes secreted by colon CAFs enhance proliferation and stemness properties of tumoral cells and are involved in chemoresistance [9]. Recently, our group demonstrated that there was a difference in how CAFs and normal colon mucosa fibroblasts (NFs) distributed ncRNA into the exosomal cargo. There was the same difference in distribution for their potential ncRNA target genes in recipient cells [10]. Our research into CAF profiles and targets of CAFderived exosome cargo in recipient cells found novel CAFderived signatures with prognostic value in colon cancer patients. This showed the importance of CAFs and their derived exosomes in tumor progression (Fig. 1).",

            "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming and immune escape play a major role in tumorigenesis. Increasing number of studies have shown that reprogramming of glutamine metabolism is a putative determinant of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Usually, the predatory uptake of glutamine by tumor cells in the TME results in the limited utilization of glutamine by immune cells and affects the anti-tumor immune response. The cell-programmed glutamine partitioning also affects the anti-tumor immune response. However, the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism in tumors modulates immune escape by regulating tumor PD-L1 expression. Likewise, the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism in the immune cells also affects their immune function. Additionally, different types of glutamine metabolism inhibitors extensively regulate the immune cells in the TME while suppressing tumor cell proliferation. Herein, we discuss how metabolic reprogramming of tumor and immune cells regulates anti-tumor immune responses, as well as functional changes in different immune cells in the context of targeting tumor glutamine metabolism, which can better explain the potential of targeting glutamine metabolism in combination with immunotherapy for cancer. 4cMzwV74oWjyiRZZYEfbxs Video abstract Video abstract",

            "abstract": "Background Besides featured glucose consumption, recent studies reveal that cancer cells might prefer “addicting” specific energy substrates from the tumor microenvironment (TME); however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Methods Fibroblast-specific long noncoding RNAs were screened using RNA-seq data of our NJLCC cohort, TCGA, and CCLE datasets. The expression and package of LINC01614 into exosomes were identified using flow cytometric sorting, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The transfer and functional role of LINC01614 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and CAFs were investigated using 4-thiouracil-labeled RNA transfer and gain- and loss-of-function approaches. RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase assay, gene expression microarray, and bioinformatics analysis were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved. Results We demonstrate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in LUAD primarily enhance the glutamine metabolism of cancer cells. A CAF-specific long noncoding RNA, LINC01614, packaged by CAF-derived exosomes, mediates the enhancement of glutamine uptake in LUAD cells. Mechanistically, LINC01614 directly interacts with ANXA2 and p65 to facilitate the activation of NF-κB, which leads to the upregulation of the glutamine transporters SLC38A2 and SLC7A5 and eventually enhances the glutamine influx of cancer cells. Reciprocally, tumor-derived proinflammatory cytokines upregulate LINC01614 in CAFs, constituting a feedforward loop between CAFs and cancer cells. Blocking exosome-transmitted LINC01614 inhibits glutamine addiction and LUAD growth in vivo. Clinically, LINC01614 expression in CAFs is associated with the glutamine influx and poor prognosis of patients with LUAD. Conclusion Our study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting a CAF-specific lncRNA to inhibit glutamine utilization and cancer progression in LUAD.",

Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society provides an update of CRC statistics based on incidence from population‐based cancer registries and mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, approximately 153,020 individuals will be diagnosed with CRC and 52,550 will die from the disease, including 19,550 cases and 3750 deaths in individuals younger than 50 years. The decline in CRC incidence slowed from 3%–4% annually during the 2000s to 1% annually during 2011–2019, driven partly by an increase in individuals younger than 55 years of 1%–2% annually since the mid‐1990s. Consequently, the proportion of cases among those younger than 55 years increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019. Incidence since circa 2010 increased in those younger than 65 years for regional‐stage disease by about 2%–3% annually and for distant‐stage disease by 0.5%–3% annually, reversing the overall shift to earlier stage diagnosis that occurred during 1995 through 2005. For example, 60% of all new cases were advanced in 2019 versus 52% in the mid‐2000s and 57% in 1995, before widespread screening. There is also a shift to left‐sided tumors, with the proportion of rectal cancer increasing from 27% in 1995 to 31% in 2019. CRC mortality declined by 2% annually from 2011–2020 overall but increased by 0.5%–3% annually in individuals younger than 50 years and in Native Americans younger than 65 years. In summary, despite continued overall declines, CRC is rapidly shifting to diagnosis at a younger age, at a more advanced stage, and in the left colon/rectum. Progress against CRC could be accelerated by uncovering the etiology of rising incidence in generations born since 1950 and increasing access to high‐quality screening and treatment among all populations, especially Native Americans.",

In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through 2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991 because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment options in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, these gains are threatened by increasing incidence for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates increased during 2015–2019 by 0.6%–1% annually for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and by 2%–3% annually for prostate, liver (female), kidney, and human papillomavirus‐associated oral cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also increased by 1%–2% annually for cervical (ages 30–44 years) and colorectal cancers (ages <55 years) in young adults. Colorectal cancer was the fourth‐leading cause of cancer death in both men and women younger than 50 years in the late‐1990s but is now first in men and second in women. Progress is also hampered by wide persistent cancer disparities; compared to White people, mortality rates are two‐fold higher for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers in Black people and for liver, stomach, and kidney cancers in Native American people. Continued national progress will require increased investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially among American Indian and Alaska Native and Black individuals.",

        "abstract": "Background: Huang Qin Decoction (HQD) is a well-established Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulation recognized for its application in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the precise therapeutic mechanisms remain inadequately defined. Methods: This study integrates metabolomics from a mouse model and network pharmacology to screen potential targets and bio-active ingredients of HQD. The pharmacological activity of HQD for CRC was evidenced via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) assays and cellular experimental validation were used to confirm the relative mechanisms. Results: The metabolite profile undergoes significant alterations, with metabolic reprogramming evident during the malignant progression of CRC liver metastasis. Network pharmacology analysis identified that HQD regulates several metabolic pathways, including arginine biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism, by targeting key proteins such as aspartate aminotransferase (GOT1), cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), and carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2). ScRNA-seq analysis indicated that HQD may enhance the functionality of cytotoxic T cells, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Virtual verification revealed a strong binding affinity between the identified hub targets and active constituents of HQD, a finding subsequently corroborated by AFM assays. Cellular experiments confirmed that naringenin treatment inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells by downregulating GOT1 expression and disrupting glutamine metabolism. Conclusions: Computational prediction and in vitro validation reveal the active ingredients, potential targets, and molecular mechanisms of HQD against CRC liver metastasis, thereby providing a scientific foundation for the application of TCM in CRC treatment.",

            "abstract": "The liver is the most common site of metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer due to its anatomical situation regarding its portal circulation. About 14 to 18% of patients with colorectal cancer present metastasis at the first medical consultation, and 10 to 25% at the time of the resection of the primary colorectal cancer. The incidence is higher (35%) when a computed tomography (CT) scan is used. In the last decades, a significant increase in the life expectancy of patients with colorectal cancer has been achieved with different diagnostic and treatment programs. Despite these improvements, the presence of metastasis, disease recurrence, and advanced local tumors continue to remain poor prognostic factors. Median survival without treatment is <8 months from the moment of its presentation, and a survival rate at 5 years of 11% is the best prognosis for those who present with local metastasis. Even in patients with limited metastatic disease, 5-year survival is exceptional. Patients with hepatic metastasis of colorectal cancer have a median survival of 5 to 20 months with no treatment. Approximately 20 to 30% of patients with colorectal metastasis have disease confined to the liver, and this can be managed with surgery. Modern surgical strategies at the main hepatobiliary centers have proved that hepatectomy of 70% of the liver can be performed, with a mortality rate of <5%. It is very important to have knowledge of predisposing factors, diagnostic methods, and treatment of hepatic metastasis. However, the establishment of newer, efficient, preventive screening programs for early diagnosis and adequate treatment is vital.

            "abstract": "BackgroundModern medicine often clashes with traditional medicine such as Chinese herbal medicine because of the little understanding of the underlying mechanisms of action of the herbs. In an effort to promote integration of both sides and to accelerate the drug discovery from herbal medicines, an efficient systems pharmacology platform that represents ideal information convergence of pharmacochemistry, ADME properties, drug-likeness, drug targets, associated diseases and interaction networks, are urgently needed.DescriptionThe traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP) was built based on the framework of systems pharmacology for herbal medicines. It consists of all the 499 Chinese herbs registered in the Chinese pharmacopoeia with 29,384 ingredients, 3,311 targets and 837 associated diseases. Twelve important ADME-related properties like human oral bioavailability, half-life, drug-likeness, Caco-2 permeability, blood-brain barrier and Lipinski’s rule of five are provided for drug screening and evaluation. TCMSP also provides drug targets and diseases of each active compound, which can automatically establish the compound-target and target-disease networks that let users view and analyze the drug action mechanisms. It is designed to fuel the development of herbal medicines and to promote integration of modern medicine and traditional medicine for drug discovery and development.ConclusionsThe particular strengths of TCMSP are the composition of the large number of herbal entries, and the ability to identify drug-target networks and drug-disease networks, which will help revealing the mechanisms of action of Chinese herbs, uncovering the nature of TCM theory and developing new herb-oriented drugs.

            "abstract": "Huangqin-Tang decoction (HQT) is a classic traditional Chinese herbal formulation that is widely used to ameliorate the symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study was designed to investigate the therapeutic potential and immunological regulatory activity of HQT in experimental colitis in rats. Using an animal model of colitis by intrarectally administering 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS), we found that administration of HQT significantly inhibited the severity of TNBS-induced colitis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, treatment with HQT produced better results than that with mesalazine, as shown by improvedweight loss bleeding and diarrhoea scores, colon length, and intestinal inflammation. As for potential immunological regulation of HQT action, the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells were reduced, but those Th2 and Treg cells were enhanced in LPMCs after HQT treatment. Additionally, HQT lowered the levels of Th1/Th17-associated cytokines but increased production of Th2/Treg-associated cytokines in the colon and MLNs. Furthermore, we observed a remarkable suppression of the Th1/Th17-associated transcription factors T-bet and ROR-γt. However, expression levels of the Th2/Treg-associated transcription factors GATA-3 and Foxp3 were enhanced during treatment with HQT. Our results suggest that HQT has the therapeutic potential to ameliorate TNBS-induced colitis symptoms. This protective effect is possibly mediated by its effects on CD4+ T cells subsets.",

To identify the proteins and to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in colorectal carcinogenesis, 2-DE coupled with MS/MS analysis were employed to compare the global protein profile between CRC and individual matched normal tissues from 8 CRC patients. Of 36 proteins identified, carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) was one of most significantly altered and its downregulation in CRC tissues was verified by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry methods, suggesting that CA II may serve as a potential biomarker for CRC diagnosis. To investigate the function and mechanisms of CA II in CRC, a stable SW480 colorectal cancer cell line overexpressing CA II was established. It was shown that overexpression of CA II remarkably suppressed tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, which was in part interpreted by cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and G2 phase. Further mechanism analysis revealed that the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs could be increased by CA II overexpression. Taken together, these data suggest that CA II may be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of CRC and the results may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of CRC and colorectal cancer treatment.",

Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.",

Here, PHY906 is reported to enhance the anti-tumor activity of Sorafenib in nude mice bearing HepG2 xenografts. Among the four herbal ingredients of PHY906, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (S) and Paeonia lactiflora Pall (P) are required; however, S plays a more important role than P in increasing tumor apoptosis induced by Sorafenib with an increase of mouse(m)FasL and human(h)FasR expression. PHY906 may potentiate Sorafenib action by increasing hMCP1 expression and enhancing infiltration of macrophages into tumors with a higher M1/M2 (tumor rejection) signature expression pattern, as well as affect autophagy by increasing AMPKα-P and ULK1-S555-P of tumors. Depletion of macrophage could counteract PHY906 to potentiate the anti-tumor activity of Sorafenib. It was reported that tumor cells with higher levels of ERK1/2-P are more susceptible to Sorafenib and the S component of PHY906 may increase ERK1/2-P via inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphatase in HepG2 tumors. PHY906 may potentiate the anti-hepatoma activity of Sorafenib by multiple mechanisms targeting on the inflammatory state of microenvironment of tumor tissue through two major ingredients (P and S) of PHY906.",

            "abstract": "YIV-906 (PHY906), a four-herb Chinese medicine formulation, is inspired by an 1800 year-old Chinese formulation called Huang Qin Tang which is traditionally used to treat gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. In animal studies, it could enhance anti-tumor activity of different classes of anticancer agents and promote faster recovery of the damaged intestines following irinotecan or radiation treatment. Several clinical studies have shown that YIV-906 had the potential to increase the therapeutic index of cancer treatments (chemotherapy, radiation) by prolonging life and improving patient quality of life. Results of animal studies demonstrated five clinical batches of YIV-906 had very similar in vivo activities (protection of body weight loss induced by CPT11 and enhancement of anti-tumor activity of CPT11) while four batches of commercial–made Huang Qin Tang, HQT had no or lower in vivo activities. Two quality control platforms were used to correlate the biological activity between YIV906 and HQT. Chemical profiles (using analysis of 77 peaks intensities) obtained from LC-MS could not be used to differentiate YIV-906 from commercial Huang Qin Tang. A mechanism based quality control (MBQC) platform, comprising 18 luciferase reporter cell lines and two enzymatic assays based on the mechanism action of YIV-906, could be used to differentiate YIV-906 from commercial Huang Qin Tang. Results of MBQC could be matched to their in vivo activities on irinotecan. In conclusion, the quality control of an herbal product should be dependent on its pharmacological usage. For its specific usage appropriate biological assays based on its mechanism action should be developed for QC. Chemical fingerprints comparison approach has limitations unless irrelevant chemicals have been filtered out. Additionally, using a similarity index is only useful when relevant information is used. A MBQC platform should also be applied on other herbal products.",

Serum levels of nine AAs were characterised in 336 CRC patients and their relationships with 20 markers of systemic inflammatory reaction, clinicopathological features of cancers and patient survival were analysed. Low serum glutamine and histidine levels and high phenylalanine levels associated with indicators of systemic inflammation, including high modified Glasgow Prognostic Score, high blood neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and high serum levels of CRP, IL-6 and IL-8. Low levels of serum glutamine, histidine, alanine and high glycine levels also associated with advanced cancer stage and with poor cancer-specific survival in univariate analysis.

            "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has recently been recognized as a breakthrough in cancer treatment. Recently, FDA has approved Nivolumab (anti-PD1) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients previously treated with sorafenib. However, the percentage of patients with a complete response was only 1.9% that is much lower than Nivolumab used for treating melanoma. Diarrhea, nausea and fatigue are common side effects for HCC patients who received Nivolumab. YIV906(PHY906) is inspired by the Huang Qin Tang, which was first described in Chinese texts 1800 years ago for the treatment of numerous gastrointestinal symptoms. Consistent preparations of PHY906 can be manufactured apart 10 years. Our clinical results suggest that YIV906 has potential to increase the therapeutic index of capecitabine or sorafenib for HCC patient by improving quality of life and prolonging life. In animal studies, YIV906 can increase the anti-tumor activity of a broad spectrum of chemotherapies through multiple mechanism of actions. We believe that YIV906 could have potential to improve the efficacy of Nivolumab, either by increasing its anti-tumor activity or decreasing its side effects. Here, we studied the effect of YIV906 on the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD1 using BDF1 mice bearing with Hepa 1-6 tumors. Results indicated that YIV906 alone had only moderate effects on the Hepa 1-6 tumor growth. Anti-PD1 alone could stabilize 80% tumor growth and caused 20% tumor shrinkage following 8-day injection. YIV906 plus anti-PD1 made all tumors disappear following 7-day treatment and no tumor rebound was found for one month. When YIV906 and different dosages of anti-PD1 ( 70ug or 200ug per animal) were used, YIV906 plus anti-PD1 (70ug) had an stronger anti-tumor effect than anti-PD1 (200ug) alone. The above results suggested that YIV906 could reduce the usage of anti-PD1 by 3-fold while having better antitumor effects than anti-PD1 alone. qRT-PCR results recovered that many genes related to M1-like macrophages and T cell activation were strongly up-regulated in the tumor tissues following YIV906 plus anti-PD1 treatment. More macrophages were found in tumor tissues associated with an upregulation of MCP1 protein following YIV906 plus anti-PD1 treatment. Biostatical analysis, based on the mRNA expression of M1 and M2-like macrophage signature genes, suggested the tumor microenvironment was favorable for M1 status following YIV906 plus anti-PD1 treatment. In addition, YIV906 could decrease LPS-induced PD1 protein of macrophages in culture. In conclusion, YIV906 might enhance the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD1 by changing the tumor microenvironment favorable to M1-like macrophages. Our results provide supportive information to initialize HCC clinical trial with YIV906 plus Nivolumab. This work was supported by grant (PO1CA154295-01A1) from NCI, USA. Dr. Y.-C.

            "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major reasons of mortality in the worldwide. There is clear evidence that some amino acids such as arginine can improve CRC and its complications. Hence, in this systematic review we evaluated the association between arginine intake and CRC improvement. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane library, and Google Scholar databases by using proper keywords to find the relevant literatures, published to March 2019. Nine human studies of 523 screened articles were included in present systematic review. The majority of studies have found a positive association between consumption of arginine and CRC improvement. Increased inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression and subsequently increasing the NO concentration in the tumor and/or serum, after arginine intake may be responsible for these protective effects. Also, arginine consumption may reduce cell proliferation in CRC and it can enhance immune function after remove the tumor. Although the benefits of arginine consumption in CRC patients were reported in previous trials, the finding need replication in well-designed studies before final conclusion.",

The UC rat model was made via a compound method (trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid plus ethanol). After a ten-day treatment, microarray analysis was performed from the colon segment of the rats. Biological functions and specific signaling pathways were enriched based on differentially expressed genes (DEG), and corresponding gene networks were constructed via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Through the network, we screened the potential “candidate targets,” such as ITGB1, FN1, CASP3, and ITGA5 and FABP1, ABCB1, FABP2, and SLC51B. These potential candidate targets were functionally related to immune responses, inflammation, and metabolism. Moreover, HQT significantly decreased serum levels of proinflammatory factors nitrogen monoxide (NO), proinflammatory cytokines interleukin- (IL-) 17, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The degree of HE staining of colonic tissue was severe in the model group but reduced significantly in the HQT group. HQT exhibited protective effects against colon damage by inhibiting the inflammatory response.",

AMDock integrates several external programs (Open Babel, PDB2PQR, AutoLigand, ADT scripts) to accurately prepare the input structure files and to optimally define the search space, offering several alternatives and different degrees of user supervision. For visualization of molecular structures, AMDock uses PyMOL, starting it automatically with several predefined visualization schemes to aid in setting up the box defining the search space and to visualize and analyze the docking results. One particularly useful feature implemented in AMDock is the off-target docking procedure that allows to conduct ligand selectivity studies easily. In summary, AMDock’s functional versatility makes it a very useful tool to conduct different docking studies, especially for beginners. The program is available, either for Windows or Linux, at https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS. This article was reviewed by Alexander Krah and Thomas Gaillard.",

To detect CYP 1A2 and CYP 1B1 isoforms, Western blot analysis was used. The activity of metalloprotreinases was studied by gelatine zymography.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the liver metastases and tissues adjacent to metastasis, the levels of low-spin forms of cytochrome P450 are lower than in the samples of conventionally normal liver tissue. Western blot analysis revealed that low-spin form of cytochrome P450 in primary tumors and liver metastases detected by electron paramagnetic resonance is attributed largely to CYP 1B1 isoform. The content of low-spin form of cytochrome P450 inversely correlated with the the activity of gelatinases (matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9). The survival of patients with high levels of the low-spin form of cytochrome P450 in tumor tissues was higher than that of patients with low levels of the enzyme (105 months vs 61 months).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn the primary tumors and liver metastases of patients with mCRC, the content of the low-spin form of cytochrome P450 decreased, which correlated inversely with patient's survival.",

            "abstract": "Molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann (Generalized-Born) surface area is one of the most popular methods to estimate binding free energies. This method has been proven to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large systems. As a result of its popularity, several programs have been developed for performing MM/PB(GB)SA calculations within the GROMACS community. These programs, however, present several limitations. Here we present gmx_MMPBSA, a new tool to perform end-state free energy calculations from GROMACS molecular dynamics trajectories. gmx_MMPBSA provides the user with several options, including binding free energy calculations with different solvation models (PB, GB, or 3D-RISM), stability calculations, computational alanine scanning, entropy corrections, and binding free energy decomposition. Noteworthy, several promising methodologies to calculate relative binding free energies such as alanine scanning with variable dielectric constant and interaction entropy have also been implemented in gmx_MMPBSA. Two additional tools-gmx_MMPBSA_test and gmx_MMPBSA_ana-have been integrated within gmx_MMPBSA to improve its usability. Multiple illustrating examples can be accessed through gmx_MMPBSA_test, while gmx_MMPBSA_ana provides fast, easy, and efficient access to different graphics plotted from gmx_MMPBSA output files.

Metabolomic analysis of various metabolic profiles represents a powerful and technically feasible method to monitor dynamic changes in tumor metabolism and response to treatment over the course of the disease. To date, numerous original studies have highlighted the application of metabolomics to various aspects of tumor metabolic reprogramming research. In this review, we summarize how metabolomics techniques can help understand the effects that changes in the metabolic profile of the tumor microenvironment on the three major metabolic pathways of tumors. Various non-invasive biofluids are available that produce accurate and useful clinical information on tumor metabolism to identify early biomarkers of tumor development. Similarly, metabolomics can predict individual metabolic differences in response to tumor drugs, assess drug efficacy, and monitor drug resistance. On this basis, we also discuss the application of stable isotope tracer technology as a method for the study of tumor metabolism, which enables the tracking of metabolite activity in the body and deep metabolic pathways. We summarize the multifaceted application of metabolomics in cancer metabolic reprogramming to reveal its important role in cancer development and treatment.",

Thus, this study is aimed at identifying serum biomarkers of CRC that could be used to distinguish CRC from healthy controls. Methods A prospective 1 : 2 individual matching case-control study was performed which included 50 healthy control subjects and 98 CRC patients. Untargeted metabolomic profiling was conducted with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify CRC-related metabolites and metabolic pathways. Results In total, 178 metabolites were detected, and an orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was useful to distinguish CRC patients from healthy controls. Nine metabolites showed significantly differential serum levels in CRC patients under the conditions of variable importance in projection (VIP) > 1, p < 0.05 using Student's t-test, and fold change (FC) ≥ 1.2 or ≤0.5. The above nine metabolites were 3-hydroxybutyric acid, hexadecanedioic acid, succinic acid semialdehyde, 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, prostaglandin B2, 2-pyrocatechuic acid, xanthoxylin, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid, and formylanthranilic acid. Four potential biomarkers were identified to diagnose CRC through ROC curves: hexadecanedioic acid, 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, 2-pyrocatechuic acid, and formylanthranilic acid. All AUC values of these four serum biomarkers were above 0.70. In addition, the exploratory analysis of metabolic pathways revealed the activated states for the vitamin B metabolic pathway and the alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolic pathways associated with CRC. Conclusion The 4 identified potential metabolic biomarkers could discriminate CRC patients from healthy controls, and the 2 metabolic pathways may be activated in the CRC tissues.",

            "abstract": "Cancer dormancy is a state characterized by the quiescence of disseminated cancer cells, and tumor recurrence occurs when such cells re-proliferate after a long incubation period. These cancer cells tend to be treatment resistant and one of the barriers to successful therapeutic intervention. We have previously reported that long-term treatment of cancer cells with linoleic acid (LA) induces a dormancy-like phenotype. However, the mechanism underpinning this effect has not yet been clarified. Here, we investigate the mechanism of LA-induced quiescence in cancer cells. We first confirmed that long-term treatment of the mouse colorectal cancer cell line CT26 with LA induced quiescence. When these cells were inoculated subcutaneously into a syngeneic mouse and fed with an LA diet, the inoculated cancer cells maintained the quiescent state and exhibited markers of dormancy. LA-treated CT26 cells showed reduced oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and energy production as well as reduced expression of the regulatory factors Pgc1α and MycC. MicroRNA expression profiling revealed that LA induced an upregulation in miR-494. The expression of Pgc1α and MycC were both induced by an miR-494 mimic, and the LA-induced decrease in gene expression was abrogated by an miR-494 inhibitor. The expression of miR-494 was enhanced by the mitochondrial oxidative stress produced by LA. In a syngeneic mouse subcutaneous tumor model, growth suppression by an LA diet and growth delay by LA pretreatment + LA diet were found to have similar effects as administration of an miR-494 mimic. In contrast, the effects of LA were abrogated by an miR-494 inhibitor. Analysis of human colorectal cancer tissue revealed that miR-494 was present at low levels in non-metastatic cases and cases with simultaneous liver metastases but was expressed at high levels in cases with delayed liver metastases, which also exhibited reduced expression of PGC1α and MYCC. These results suggest that miR-494 is involved in cancer dormancy induced by high levels of LA intake and that this microRNA may be valuable in targeting dormant cancer cells.",

However, the pharmacology and molecular mechanism of HQD on ulcerative colitis is still unclear. Combined microarray analysis, network pharmacology, and molecular docking for revealing the therapeutic targets and molecular mechanism of HQD against ulcerative colitis. TCMSP, DrugBank, Swiss Target Prediction were utilized to search the active components and effective targets of HQD. Ulcerative colitis effective targets were obtained by microarray data from the GEO database (GSE107499). Co-targets between HQD and ulcerative colitis are obtained by Draw Venn Diagram. PPI (Protein–protein interaction) network was constructed by the STRING database. To obtain the core target, topological analysis is exploited by Cytoscape 3.7.2. GO and KEGG enrichment pathway analysis was performed to Metascape platform, and molecular docking through Autodock Vina 1.1.2 finished. 161 active components with 486 effective targets of HQD were screened. 1542 ulcerative colitis effective targets were obtained with |Log2FC|> 1 and adjusted P-value < 0.05. The Venn analysis was contained 79 co-targets. Enrichment analysis showed that HQD played a role in TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, etc. IL6, TNF, IL1B, PTGS2, ESR1, and PPARG with the highest degree from PPI network were successfully docked with 19 core components of HQD, respectively. According to ZINC15 database, quercetin (ZINC4175638), baicalein (ZINC3871633), and wogonin (ZINC899093) recognized as key compounds of HQD on ulcerative colitis. PTGS2, ESR1, and PPARG are potential therapeutic targets of HQD. HQD can act on multiple targets through multi-pathway, to carry out its therapeutic role in ulcerative colitis.",

Herein, the prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted differentiation is a discrete hallmark capability, and that nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic microbiomes both constitute distinctive enabling characteristics that facilitate the acquisition of hallmark capabilities. Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer is daunting in the breadth and scope of its diversity, spanning genetics, cell and tissue biology, pathology, and response to therapy. Ever more powerful experimental and computational tools and technologies are providing an avalanche of \"big data\" about the myriad manifestations of the diseases that cancer encompasses.

However, the systematic effects of tadalafil in colorectal cancer were not fully understood. In this study, we assessed the anti-tumor activity of tadalafil in human colorectal cancer cells. A systematic perspective of the tadalafil-induced anti-tumor mechanism was provided by the integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics. We found that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly involved in microRNAs in cancer, purine metabolism, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism. Amino acid metabolism, especially alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism was the most of the differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) through the analysis of metabolomics. The conjoint analysis of DEGs and DAMs presented that they were also mainly involved in alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Amino acid metabolism-related genes, GPT, GGT5, and TAT, were significantly decreased after tadalafil treatment. In particular, the disturbance of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism may be the explanation for the major mechanism resulting from tadalafil anti-tumor activity.",

            "abstract": "Purpose In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients (pts), treatment strategies integrating liver resection with induction chemotherapy offer better 5-year survival rates than chemotherapy alone. However, liver resection is a complex and costly procedure, and recurrence occurs in almost 2/3rds of pts, suggesting the need to identify those at higher risk. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether the integration of plasma metabolomics and lipidomics combined with the multiplex analysis of a large panel of plasma cytokines can be used to predict the risk of relapse and other patient outcomes after liver surgery, beyond or in combination with clinical morphovolumetric criteria. Experimental design Peripheral blood metabolomics and lipidomics were performed by 600 MHz NMR spectroscopy on plasma from 30 unresectable mCRC pts treated with bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin-based regimens within the Obelics trial (NCT01718873) and subdivided into responder (R) and non-R (NR) according to 1-year disease-free survival (DFS): ≥ 1-year (R, n = 12) and < 1-year (NR, n = 18). A large panel of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors was evaluated on the same plasma using Luminex xMAP-based multiplex bead-based immunoassay technology. A multiple biomarkers model was built using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Results Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) and loading plots obtained by analyzing metabolomics profiles of samples collected at the time of response evaluation when resectability was established showed significantly different levels of metabolites between the two groups. Two metabolites, 3-hydroxybutyrate and histidine, significantly predicted DFS and overall survival. Lipidomics analysis confirmed clear differences between the R and NR pts, indicating a statistically significant increase in lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids) in NR pts, reflecting a nonspecific inflammatory response. Indeed, a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines was demonstrated in NR pts plasma. Finally, a multiple biomarkers model based on the combination of presurgery plasma levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate, cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides and IL-6 was able to correctly classify patients by their DFS with good accuracy. Conclusion Overall, this exploratory study suggests the potential of these combined biomarker approaches to predict outcomes in mCRC patients who are candidates for liver metastasis resection after induction treatment for defining personalized management and treatment strategies.",

            "abstract": "Background: Increasingly, studies have discovered that different fatty acids (Fas) are linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Methods: We systematically searched Embase and Medline databases to identify eligible studies that examined the associations of different types of Fas with CRC risk. The effect estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (Cis) were pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the study findings. Results: This study evaluated the associations of 28 dietary and 18 blood Fas with CRC risk by summarizing the most updated evidence from 54 observational and four Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies. The present findings suggested that high dietary intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexanoic acid (DHA), and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) are related to low risk of CRC, while the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio and trans-FA are related to high risk of CRC. The summary of all cohort studies found that a high intake of SFA and DHA was a protective factor for CRC, and a high intake of the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio was a risk factor for CRC. In the subgroup analysis of cancer subsites, we found that the dietary intake of linoleic acid (LA) and trans-FA are risk factors, while DPA is a protective factor for colon cancer. High dietary DHA intake was associated with a lower risk of rectal cancer, while the dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio was associated with a higher risk of rectal cancer. Meta-analysis of blood FA levels showed a significant reverse association between blood pentadecanoic acid and CRC risk, whilst other blood Fas showed no significant association with CRC risk. All included MR studies showed that high plasma arachidonic acid (AA) is associated with increased CRC risk. Conclusions: Current evidence on the dietary intake and blood levels of Fas in relation to CRC risk is less consistent. Future studies are needed to investigate how the metabolism of Fas contributes to CRC development.",

            "abstract": "Further insights into metabolic reprogramming by cancer cells are needed to determine if targeting glutamine metabolism could be a useful therapeutic approach. Cancer cells rely on the amino acid glutamine for growth and proliferation. Glutamine is a key nitrogen source and enables the cells to synthesize critical molecules including lipids and metabolites. Blocking glutamine metabolism may be useful in treating cancers, but care must be taken due to glutamine’s multiple roles. Keun-Gyu Park and Yeon-Kyung Choi at Kyungpook National University in Daegu, South Korea, and co-workers reviewed current knowledge of the steps involved in glutamine metabolism to identify opportunities for intervention. Cancers can evade glutamine metabolism inhibition by manipulating the tumor microenvironment and finding alternative ways to source nutrients. Drug trials have targeted aspects of glutamine metabolism with mixed success, inhibition of glutamine transporters showing promise. Proliferating cancer cells rely largely on glutamine for survival and proliferation. Glutamine serves as a carbon source for the synthesis of lipids and metabolites via the TCA cycle, as well as a source of nitrogen for amino acid and nucleotide synthesis. To date, many studies have explored the role of glutamine metabolism in cancer, thereby providing a scientific rationale for targeting glutamine metabolism for cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the mechanism(s) involved at each step of glutamine metabolism, from glutamine transporters to redox homeostasis, and highlight areas that can be exploited for clinical cancer treatment. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms underlying cancer cell resistance to agents that target glutamine metabolism, as well as strategies for overcoming these mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the effects of glutamine blockade on the tumor microenvironment and explore strategies to maximize the utility of glutamine blockers as a cancer treatment.",

We proposed that microbial butyrate mediated PI3K/Akt pathway suppression might involve the anti-cancer effect of HQD.Aim. This study aimed to evaluate the potential mechanism of HQD against CRC.Methodology. An azoxymethane plus dextran sulphate sodium induced CRC mouse model was used, and the intestinal flora and faecal short-chain fatty acid changes were detected, respectively, after HQD administration with 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Disease activity index, colon length and levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured to evaluate the effect of HQD on intestinal inflammation. Tumour size, number and histopathology were assessed to reflect the impact of HQD on tumour burden. Apoptosis and PI3K/Akt pathway activity were measured by TUNEL staining and Western-blotting. In vitro, the effects of sodium butyrate (NaB) on the viability of CRC cell lines were detected by the Cell-counting Kit-8. The apoptotic cells were determined by TUNEL staining. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by wound healing assay and Transwell assay, respectively. Western-blotting and immunofluorescent staining were used to test the activity of PI3K/Akt pathway.Results. Animal study showed that HQD could improve the gut dysbiosis, increase the abundance of Clostridium and the level of faecal butyric acid. Then, we found that HQD could attenuate colitis, reduce tumour burden, promote cell apoptosis and suppress PI3K/Akt pathway activity in CRC mice. In vitro experiment revealed that NaB treatment could inhibit cell growth, migration and invasion in CRC cell lines. Additionally, NaB enhanced cellular apoptosis, and reduced phosphorylated PI3K and Akt expressions. Interestingly, addition of 740Y-P, an agonist of PI3K, reversed the NaB effects on CRC cells.Conclusion. Overall, in this study, we revealed that HQD could induce apoptosis through microbial butyrate mediated PI3K/Akt inhibition and perform anti-CRC activity.",

It was determined whether or not the modeling was successful by killing 10 rats from each of the two groups. The remaining 10 rats in the normal group were then employed as the control group for the experiment. The random number table method was used to split the rats into two groups: the Huangqin Decoction (n = 10) and the Natural Recovery (n = 10) groups. For seven days, participants in the Huangqin Decoction group received the herb, whereas those in the natural healing group received normal saline. The relative density of SREBP1, the levels of cholesterol ester (CE), free cholesterol (FC), total cholesterol (TC), and Treg cells were detected and compared. Results When compared to the control group, the relative density of SREBP1 increased significantly before administration in the Huangqin Decoction group and the natural recovery group, but decreased significantly after administration, with statistical significance (P < 0.05) in the Huangqin Decoction group and the natural recovery group; the Huangqin Decoction group and natural recovery group had significantly higher levels of CE, FC, and TC than the control group before to administration, and these levels increased significantly after administration. CE, FC, and TC levels in Huangqin Decoction and natural recovery groups were much lower than those in natural recovery groups, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05), according to the results; Prior to administration, Treg cell levels in Huangqin Decoction group and the natural recovery group were significantly higher, and Treg cell levels in the Huangqin Decoction group and natural recovery group were significantly lower after administration; the decrease in the Huangqin Decoction group was significantly greater than that in natural recovery group. P < 0.05 indicated that the difference was significant. Conclusion Using Huangqin Decoction, one may efficiently regulate SREBP1, cholesterol metabolism, and Treg cell development, all of which play an important role in maintaining intestinal stability and minimizing the incidence of colon cancer.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND To analyze the potential action mechanism of Huangqin decoction (HQD) in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment on the basis of network pharmacology and molecular docking. AIM To investigate the molecular mechanisms of HQD for CRC treatment by using network pharmacology and molecular docking. METHODS All HQD active ingredients were searched using the Systematic Pharmacology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology databases and the Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular Mechanisms in traditional Chinese medicine. Then, the targets of the active ingredients were screened. The abbreviations of protein targets were obtained from the UniProt database. A “drug–compound–target” network was constructed to screen for some main active ingredients. Some targets related to the therapeutic effect of CRC were obtained from the GeneCards, DisGeNET, Therapeutic Target Database, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man databases. The intersection of targets of Chinese herbs and CRC was taken. A Venn diagram was drawn to construct the intersection target interactions network by referring to the STRING database. Topological analysis of the protein interaction network was performed using Cytoscape 3.7.2 software to screen the core HQD targets for CRC. The core targets were imported into the DAVID 6.8 analysis website for gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses and visualization. Finally, molecular docking was performed using AutoDockTool and PyMOL for validation. RESULTS In total, 280 potential drug-active ingredients were present in HQD, including 1474 targets of the drug-active ingredients. The main active ingredients identified were betulin, tetrahydropalmatine, and quercetin. In total, 10249 CRC-related targets and 1014 drug-disease intersecting targets were identified, including 28 core targets of action such as Jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, tumor protein p53, vascular endothelial growth factor, and AKT serine/threonine kinase 1. The gene ontology enrichment functional analysis yielded 503 enrichment results, including 406 biological processes that were mainly related to the positive regulation of both gene expression and transcription and cellular response to hypoxia, etc. In total, 38 cellular components were primarily related to polymer complexes, transcription factor complexes, and platelet alpha granule lumen. Then, 59 molecular functions were closely related to the binding of enzymes, homologous proteins, and transcription factors. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis yielded 139 enrichment results, involving epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance and HIF-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. CONCLUSION HQD can play a role in CRC treatment through the “multi-component-target–pathway”. The active ingredients betulin, tetrahydropalmatine, and quercetin may act on targets such as Jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, tumor protein p53, vascular endothelial growth factor, and AKT serine/threonine kinase 1, which in turn regulate HIF-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in CRC treatment. The molecular docking junction clarified that all four key target proteins could bind strongly to the main HQD active ingredients. This indicates that HQD could slow down CRC progression by modulating multiple targets and signaling pathways.",

            "abstract": "Oncogenic KRAS (KRAS*) contributes to many cancer hallmarks. In colorectal cancer (CRC), KRAS* suppresses anti-tumor immunity to promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Here, we uncovered that KRAS* transforms the phenotype of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) into lipid-laden CAFs, promoting angiogenesis and tumor progression. Mechanistically, KRAS* activates the transcription factor CP2 (TFCP2) which upregulates the expression of the pro-adipogenic factors BMP4 and WNT5B, triggering the transformation of CAFs into lipid-rich CAFs. These lipid-rich CAFs, in turn, produce vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) to spur angiogenesis. In KRAS*-driven CRC mouse models, genetic or pharmacological neutralization of TFCP2 reduced lipid-rich CAFs, lessened tumor angiogenesis, and improved overall survival. Correspondingly, in human CRC, lipid-rich CAF and TFCP2 signatures correlate with worse prognosis. This work unveils a new role for KRAS* in transforming CAFs, driving tumor angiogenesis and disease progression, providing an actionable therapeutic intervention for KRAS*-driven CRC.",

            "abstract": "YIV-906 (formally PHY906, KD018) is a four-herb formulation that is currently being developed to improve the therapeutic index and ameliorate the side effects of many chemotherapeutic drugs including sorafenib, irinotecan, and capecitabine. However, as a promising anti-cancer adjuvant, the molecular mechanism of action of YIV-906 remains unrevealed due to its multi-component and multi-target features. Since YIV-906 has been shown to induce apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells through modulating the negative regulators of ERK1/2, namely DUSPs, it is of great interest to elucidate the key components that cause the therapeutic effect of YIV-906. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of YIV-906 inhibiting DUSPs, using a broad spectrum of molecular modelling techniques, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding free energy calculations. In total, MD simulations and binding free energy calculations were performed for 99 DUSP-ligand complexes. We found that some herbal components or their metabolites could inhibit DUSPs. Based on the docking scores and binding free energies, the sulfation and glucuronidation metabolites of the S ingredient in YIV-906 play a leading role in inhibiting DUSPs, although several original herbal chemicals with carboxyl groups from the P and Z ingredients also make contributions to this inhibitory effect. It is not a surprise that the electrostatic interaction plays the dominant role in the ligand binding process, given the fact that several charged residues reside in the binding pockets of DUSPs. Our MD simulation results demonstrate that the sulfate moieties and carboxyl moieties of the advantageous ligands from YIV-906 can occupy the enzymes' catalytic sites, mimicking the endogenous phosphate substrates of DUSPs. As such, the ligand binding can inhibit the association of DUSPs and ERK1/2, which in turn reduces the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and causes cell cycle arrest in the tumor. Our modelling study provides useful insights into the rational design of highly potent anti-cancer drugs targeting DUSPs. Finally, we have demonstrated that multi-scale molecular modelling techniques are able to elucidate molecular mechanisms involving complex molecular systems.",

Early attempts to inhibit Gln metabolism using glutaminase inhibitors resulted in rapid metabolic reprogramming and therapeutic resistance. Here, we demonstrated that treating PDAC cells with a Gln antagonist, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), led to a metabolic crisis in vitro. In addition, we observed a profound decrease in tumor growth in several in vivo models using sirpiglenastat (DRP-104), a pro-drug version of DON that was designed to circumvent DON-associated toxicity. We found that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is increased as a compensatory mechanism. Combinatorial treatment with DRP-104 and trametinib led to a significant increase in survival in a syngeneic model of PDAC. These proof-of-concept studies suggested that broadly targeting Gln metabolism could provide a therapeutic avenue for PDAC. The combination with an ERK signaling pathway inhibitor could further improve the therapeutic outcome.",

The effective mechanism study of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) characterized by multi-component, multi-targeted, and integrative efficacy, perfectly corresponds to the application of network pharmacology. Currently, network pharmacology has been widely utilized to clarify the mechanism of the physiological activity of TCM. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the application of network pharmacology in TCM to reveal its potential of verifying the phenotype and underlying causes of diseases, realizing the personalized and accurate application of TCM. We searched the literature using “TCM network pharmacology” and “network pharmacology” as keywords from Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, as well as Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure in the last decade. The origins, development, and application of network pharmacology are closely correlated with the study of TCM which has been applied in China for thousands of years. Network pharmacology and TCM have the same core idea and promote each other. A well-defined research strategy for network pharmacology has been utilized in several aspects of TCM research, including the elucidation of the biological basis of diseases and syndromes, the prediction of TCM targets, the screening of TCM active compounds, and the decipherment of mechanisms of TCM in treating diseases. However, several factors limit its application, such as the selection of databases and algorithms, the unstable quality of the research results, and the lack of standardization. This review aims to provide references and ideas for the research of TCM and to encourage the personalized and precise use of Chinese medicine.",

In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through 2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991 because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment options in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, these gains are threatened by increasing incidence for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates increased during 2015–2019 by 0.6%–1% annually for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and by 2%–3% annually for prostate, liver (female), kidney, and human papillomavirus‐associated oral cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also increased by 1%–2% annually for cervical (ages 30–44 years) and colorectal cancers (ages <55 years) in young adults. Colorectal cancer was the fourth‐leading cause of cancer death in both men and women younger than 50 years in the late‐1990s but is now first in men and second in women. Progress is also hampered by wide persistent cancer disparities; compared to White people, mortality rates are two‐fold higher for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers in Black people and for liver, stomach, and kidney cancers in Native American people. Continued national progress will require increased investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially among American Indian and Alaska Native and Black individuals.",

Drug resistance and unwanted side effects are some of the limitations of current treatments for CRC. Naringenin (NAR) is a naturally occurring compound found in abundance in various citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruits, and tomatoes. It possesses a diverse range of pharmacological and biological properties that are beneficial for human health. Numerous studies have highlighted its antioxidant, anticancer, and anti‐inflammatory activities, making it a subject of interest in scientific research. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of NAR on CRC. The study's findings indicated that NAR: (1) interacts with estrogen receptors, (2) regulates the expression of genes related to the p53 signaling pathway, (3) promotes apoptosis by increasing the expression of proapoptotic genes (Bax, caspase9, and p53) and downregulation of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl2, (4) inhibits the activity of enzymes involved in cell survival and proliferation, (5) decreases cyclin D1 levels, (6) reduces the expression of cyclin‐dependent kinases (Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdk7) and antiapoptotic genes (Bcl2, x‐IAP, and c‐IAP‐2) in CRC cells. In vitro CDK2 binding assay was also performed, showing that the NAR derivatives had better inhibitory activities on CDK2 than NAR. Based on the findings of this study, NAR is a potential therapeutic agent for CRC. Additional pharmacology and pharmacokinetics studies are required to fully elucidate the mechanisms of action of NAR and establish the most suitable dose for subsequent clinical investigations.",

            "abstract": "Introduction and Purpose: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyric acid, acetic acid and propionic acid, are naturally produced in the large intestine by bacterial fermentation of insoluble carbohydrates and oligosaccharides. Butyric acid, which is the main source of energy for colon cells, has regenerative, cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Its physiological importance lies in maintaining the integrity and function of the intestinal epithelium, which protects the body against pathogens and oxidative stress. SCFA deficiencies resulting from low dietary fiber supply can lead to intestinal disorders. Supplementation with sodium butyrate, particularly using micro-encapsulation technology, enables efficient delivery of butyric acid to the gut, which may be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and in the prevention of obesity and insulin resistance. Sodium butyrate (NaB) also has promising potential in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), inducing apoptosis of cancer cells, increasing sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and protecting healthy cells. SCFAs, especially butyrate, play a key role in reproductive medicine, oncology and gastroenterology, contributing to the maintenance of health and being potential therapeutic targets. The aim of this paper is to review the available literature on this topic.\nMaterial and methods: The review was based on articles obtained from PubMed scientific database published from 2014-2024, using the following keywords: sodium butyrate, obesity, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, SCFA.\nConclusions: Studies confirm the beneficial effects of sodium butyrate on metabolism, intestinal integrity and reduction of inflammation, opening up new possibilities in the treatment of metabolic disorders and intestinal diseases. However, further clinical studies conducted on humans are still needed, as most of the work to date has been conducted on mice and/or rats.",

        "abstract": "Background Colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) are associated with a poor prognosis, reflected by a five-year survival rate of 14%. Anti-angiogenic therapy through anti-VEGF antibody administration is one of the limited therapies available. However, only a subgroup of metastases uses sprouting angiogenesis to secure their nutrients and oxygen supply, while others rely on vessel co-option (VCO). The distinct mode of vascularization is reflected by specific histopathological growth patterns (HGPs), which have proven prognostic and predictive significance. Nevertheless, their molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Methods We evaluated CRCLM from 225 patients regarding their HGP and clinical data. Moreover, we performed spatial (21,804 spots) and single-cell (22,419 cells) RNA sequencing analyses to explore molecular differences in detail, further validated in vitro through immunohistochemical analysis and patient-derived organoid cultures. Results We detected specific metabolic alterations and a signature of WNT signalling activation in metastatic cancer cells related to the VCO phenotype. Importantly, in the corresponding healthy liver of CRCLM displaying sprouting angiogenesis, we identified a predominantly expressed capillary subtype of endothelial cells, which could be further explored as a possible predictor for HGP relying on sprouting angiogenesis. Conclusion These findings may prove to be novel therapeutic targets to the treatment of CRCLM, in special the ones relying on VCO.",

            "abstract": "Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.",

It is unclear, however, if the presence of vimentin is necessary during differentiation to the endothelial phenotype. Here we evaluated gene and protein expression of differentiating wild type embryonic stem cells (WT ESCs) and vimentin knockout embryonic stem cells (VIM −/− ESCs) using embryoid bodies (EBs) formed from both cell types. Over seven days of differentiation VIM −/− EBs had altered morphology compared to WT EBs, with a rippled outer surface and a smaller size due to decreased proliferation. Gene expression of pluripotency markers decreased similarly for EBs of both cell types; however, VIM −/− EBs had impaired differentiation towards the endothelial phenotype. This was quantified with decreased expression of markers along the specification pathway, specifically the early mesodermal marker Brachy-T, the lateral plate mesodermal marker FLK1 and the endothelial-specific markers TIE2, PECAM and VE-CADHERIN. Taken together, these results indicate that the absence of vimentin impairs spontaneous differentiation of ESCs to the endothelial phenotype in vitro.",

In this study, we aim to investigate its biological function and clinical significance in human colon cancer.MethodsWe analyzed the expression of TIMP1 in both public database (Oncomine and TCGA) and 94 cases of primary colon cancer and matched normal colon tissue specimens. The underlying mechanisms of altered TIMP1 expression on cell tumorigenesis, proliferation, and metastasis were explored in vitro and in vivo.ResultsTIMP1 was overexpressed in colon tumorous tissues and lymph node metastasis specimens than in normal tissues. The aberrant expression of TIMP1 was significantly associated with the regional lymph node metastasis (p = 0.033), distant metastasis (p = 0.039), vascular invasion (p = 0.024) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (p = 0.026). Cox proportional hazards model showed that TIMP1 was an independent prognostic indicator of disease-free survival (HR = 2.603, 95 % CI: 1.115–6.077, p = 0.027) and overall survival (HR = 2.907, 95 % CI: 1.254–6.737, p = 0.013) for patients with colon cancer. Consistent with this, our findings highlight that suppression of TIMP1 expression decreased proliferation, and metastasis but increased apoptosis by inducing TIMP1 specific regulated FAK-PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway.ConclusionTIMP1 might play an important role in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis of human colon cancer and function as a potential prognostic indicator for colon cancer.",

            "abstract": "Although the renin angiotensin system (RAS) is a major regulator of vascular homeostasis, the role of the RAS in tumor angiogenesis is little understood. Here we show that host angiotensin II (ATII) type 1 (AT1) receptor plays an important role in angiogenesis and growth of tumor cells engrafted in mice. Subcutaneous B16-F1 melanoma-induced angiogenesis as assessed by tissue capillary density and microangiography was prominent in WT mice but was reduced in AT1a receptor-deficient (AT1a-/-) mice. Consequently, tumor growth rate was significantly slower, and the mouse survival rate was greater, in AT1a-/- mice than in WT mice. Tumor growth was also reduced in WT mice treated with TCV-116, a selective blocker of AT1 receptor. Because the beta-galactosidase gene was inserted into the AT1a gene locus in AT1a-/- mice, the site of beta-galactosidase expression represents the AT1a receptor expression in these mutant mice. In tumor-implanted AT1a-/- mice, the major site of the beta-galactosidase expression was macrophages in tissues surrounding tumors. Moreover, the number of infiltrated macrophages was significantly lower in AT1a-/- mice than in WT mice, and double-immunofluorescence staining revealed that these macrophages expressed VEGF protein intensively. Therefore, the host ATII-AT1 receptor pathway supports tumor-associated macrophage infiltration, which results in enhanced tissue VEGF protein levels. The host ATII-AT1 receptor pathway thereby plays important roles in tumor-related angiogenesis and growth in vivo.",

Ligand activation of Notch releases the intracellular domain of the receptor that translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription through the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jkappa. Previously, it has been shown that the Notch4 intracellular region (N4IC) can inhibit endothelial sprouting and angiogenesis. Here, N4IC deletion mutants were assessed for their ability to inhibit human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC) sprouting with the use of a quantitative endothelial sprouting assay. Deletion of the ankyrin repeats, but not the RAM (RBP-Jkappa associated module) domain or C-terminal region (CT), abrogated the inhibition of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2)- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced sprouting by Notch4, whereas the ankyrin repeats alone partially blocked sprouting. The ankyrin repeats were also the only domain required for up-regulation of RBP-Jkappa-dependent gene expression. Interestingly, enforced expression of the ankyrin domain alone was sufficient to up-regulate some, but not all, RBP-Jkappa-dependent genes. Although N4IC reduced VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin expression, neither of these events is necessary and sufficient to explain N4IC-mediated inhibition of sprouting. A constitutively active RBP-Jkappa mutant significantly inhibited HMEC sprouting but not as strongly as N4IC. Thus, Notch4-induced inhibition of sprouting requires the ankyrin repeats and appears to involve RBP-Jkappa-dependent and -independent signaling.",

However, how metabolism supports this adaptation of cancer cells is poorly defined. We use 2D versus 3D cultivation to induce a shift in the cellular phenotype of breast cancer cells. We discover that proline catabolism via proline dehydrogenase (Prodh) supports growth of breast cancer cells in 3D culture. Subsequently, we link proline catabolism to in vivo metastasis formation. In particular, we find that PRODH expression and proline catabolism is increased in metastases compared to primary breast cancers of patients and mice. Moreover, inhibiting Prodh is sufficient to impair formation of lung metastases in the orthotopic 4T1 and EMT6.5 mouse models, without adverse effects on healthy tissue and organ function. In conclusion, we discover that Prodh is a potential drug target for inhibiting metastasis formation. Metastasizing cancer cells rewire their metabolism to support their malignant phenotypes. Here, the authors show that the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype in breast cancer cell lines results in increased proline catabolism and that inhibition of this pathway decreases lung metastasis formation in two mouse models.",

To elicit these effects, Wnts act as autocrine as well as paracrine signalling molecules between Wnt-producing and Wnt-receiving cells. More than 40 years after the discovery of the Wg/Wnt pathway, it is still unclear how they are transported to fulfil their paracrine signalling functions. Several mechanisms have been proposed to mediate intercellular Wnt transport, including Wnt-binding proteins, lipoproteins, exosomes and cytonemes. In this Review, we describe the evidence for each proposed mechanism, and discuss how they may contribute to Wnt dispersal in tissue-specific and context-dependent manners, to regulate embryonic development precisely and maintain the internal steady state within a defined tissue. Summary: This Review describes the trafficking mechanisms proposed to mediate the extracellular transport of Wnt proteins and discusses how they contribute to Wnt dispersal.",

The search for therapeutic targets for gliomas has always been a focus of research in the field of neurology. The unusual expression of epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) has been proved in most tumors. In our study, we determined the expression level of EMP1 expression in glioma tissues. There were higher levels of EMP1 in glioma tissues—particularly GBM tissues—than those in normal brain tissues. Then we discovered that silencing EMP1 inhibited glioma cell invasion and proliferation through inhibiting the PI3K‐AKT signaling pathway. Subsequently, we investigated the function of EMP1 on glioma stem cells and found that it regulates the expression of CD44 in such cells to promote stemness. Taken together, the new strategies for the treatment of glioma may be provided by these finding, thereby improving the prognosis associated with it.",

Thus, robust membrane repair mechanisms have evolved to counteract the eminent threat of a torn plasma membrane. Different repair mechanisms and the bio-physical parameters required for efficient repair are now emerging from different research groups. However, less is known about when these mechanisms come into play. This review focuses on the existence of membrane disruptions and repair mechanisms in both physiological and pathological conditions, and across multiple cell types, albeit to different degrees. Fundamentally, irrespective of the source of membrane disruption, aberrant calcium influx is the common stimulus that activates the membrane repair response. Inadequate repair responses can tip the balance between physiology and pathology, highlighting the significance of plasma membrane integrity. For example, an over-activated repair response can promote cancer invasion, while the inability to efficiently repair membrane can drive neurodegeneration and muscular dystrophies. The interdisciplinary view explored here emphasises the widespread potential of targeting plasma membrane repair mechanisms for therapeutic purposes.",

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2‐fold to 3‐fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2‐fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.",

However, more than 50% of patients will develop metastases, mainly in the liver (LM-CRC), throughout the evolution of their disease, which accounts for most CRC-related deaths. Treatment it is certainly a controversial issue, since it has not been shown to increase overall survival in the adjuvant setting, although it does improve disease free survival (DFS). Moreover, current chemotherapy combinations are administered based on data extrapolated from primary tumors (PT), not considering that LM-CRC present a very particular tumor microenvironment that can radically condition the effectiveness of treatments designed for a PT. The liver has a particular histology and microenvironment that can determine tumor growth and response to treatments: double blood supply, vascularization through fenestrated sinusoids and the presence of different mesenchymal cell types, among other particularities. Likewise, the liver presents a peculiar immune response against tumor cells, a fact that correlates with the poor response to immunotherapy. All these aspects will be addressed in this review, putting them in the context of the histological growth patterns of LM-CRC, a particular pathologic feature with both prognostic and predictive repercussions.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background After resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM), 2 main histopathological growth patterns can be observed: a desmoplastic and a nondesmoplastic subtype. The desmoplastic subtype has been associated with superior survival. These findings require external validation. Methods An international multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients treated surgically for CRLM at 3 tertiary hospitals in the United States and the Netherlands. Determination of histopathological growth patterns was performed on hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections of resected CRLM according to international guidelines. Patients displaying a desmoplastic histopathological phenotype (only desmoplastic growth observed) were compared with patients with a nondesmoplastic phenotype (any nondesmoplastic growth observed). Cutoff analyses on the extent of nondesmoplastic growth were performed. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox analysis. All statistical tests were 2-sided. Results In total 780 patients were eligible. A desmoplastic phenotype was observed in 19.1% and was associated with microsatellite instability (14.6% vs 3.6%, P = .01). Desmoplastic patients had superior 5-year OS (73.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 64.1% to 84.0% vs 44.2%, 95% CI = 38.9% to 50.2%, P < .001) and DFS (32.0%, 95% CI = 22.9% to 44.7% vs 14.7%, 95% CI = 11.7% to 18.6%, P < .001) compared with their nondesmoplastic counterparts. A desmoplastic phenotype was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 0.36 (95% CI = 0.23 to 0.58) and 0.50 (95% CI = 0.37 to 0.66) for cancer recurrence. Prognosis was independent of KRAS and BRAF status. The cutoff analyses found no prognostic relationship between either OS or DFS and the extent of nondesmoplastic growth observed (all P > .1). Conclusions This external validation study confirms the remarkably good prognosis after surgery for CRLM in patients with a desmoplastic phenotype. The extent of nondesmoplastic growth does not affect prognosis.",

            "abstract": "Claudin-2 promotes breast cancer liver metastasis by enabling seeding and early cancer cell survival. We now demonstrate that Claudin-2 is functionally required for colorectal cancer liver metastasis and that Claudin-2 expression in primary colorectal cancers is associated with poor overall and liver metastasis-free survival. We have examined the role of Claudin-2, and other claudin family members, as potential prognostic biomarkers of the desmoplastic and replacement histopathological growth pattern associated with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed higher Claudin-2 levels in replacement type metastases when compared to those with desmoplastic features. In contrast, Claudin-8 was highly expressed in desmoplastic colorectal cancer liver metastases. Similar observations were made following immunohistochemical staining of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that we have established, which faithfully retain the histopathology of desmoplastic or replacement type colorectal cancer liver metastases. We provide evidence that Claudin-2 status in patient-derived extracellular vesicles may serve as a relevant prognostic biomarker to predict whether colorectal cancer patients have developed replacement type liver metastases. Such a biomarker will be a valuable tool in designing optimal treatment strategies to better manage patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Tabariès et al. describe that claudin 2 is a promoter of colorectal cancer liver metastasis. Furthermore, high Claudin-2 expression is associated with shorter time to liver-specific recurrence and is a biomarker of replacement type CRC liver metastases.",

The eukaryotic elongation factor 1 A1 (eEF1A1) exerts significant effects on protein synthesis by contributing to peptide chain extension. Whereas its role in CRC remains to be investigated. In this study, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of eEF1A1 were significantly upregulated in CRC cell lines and tissues. Elevated expression of eEF1A1 was correlated with shorter overall survival in 94 CRC patients. The inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle block were observed in CRC cells after eEF1A1 downregulation. Mechanistically, weighted gene correlation network analysis and further Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis suggested that mitogen‐activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways were significantly enriched in high‐eEF1A1 expression group, and the levels of phosphorylated p38/JNK/ERK MAPK were dramatically decreased after eEF1A1 downregulation. Overexpression of eEF1A1 in CRC correlated with a poor prognosis. Collectively, this study determined the oncogenic role of eEF1A1 in CRC proliferation and tumorigenesis. eEF1A1 might be a promising therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in CRC.",

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by extensive desmoplasia with fibroblasts as the major cell type. In the present study, we observe enrichment of myofibroblasts in a juxta-tumoral position with tumor cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that facilitates invasion and correlates with a worse clinical prognosis in PDAC patients. Direct cell-cell contacts forming heterocellular aggregates between fibroblasts and tumor cells are detected in primary pancreatic tumors and circulating tumor microemboli (CTM). Mechanistically, ATP1A1 overexpressed in tumor cells binds to and reorganizes ATP1A1 of fibroblasts that induces calcium oscillations, NF-κB activation, and activin A secretion. Silencing ATP1A1 expression or neutralizing activin A secretion suppress tumor invasion and colonization. Taken together, these results elucidate the direct interplay between tumor cells and bound fibroblasts in PDAC progression, thereby providing potential therapeutic opportunities for inhibiting metastasis by interfering with these cell-cell interactions. Direct contact between tumour cells and fibroblasts influences tumour cell behaviour. Here the authors show that pancreatic cancer cells and fibroblasts directly interact via homophilic ATP1A1 binding, which induces fibroblasts to secrete activin A to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumour cells and myofibroblast activation.",

Vim-/- mice exhibit process defects associated with cell differentiation, which can have implications for understanding cancer and disease. This review showed recent reports from studies that unveiled vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs) as an essential component of the cytoskeleton, followed by a description of vimentin's physiological functions and process reports in VIF signaling pathway and gene network studies. The main focus of the discussion is on vital signaling pathways associated with how VIF coordinates invasion cells and migration. The current research will open up multiple processes to research the function of VIF and other IF proteins in cellular and molecular biology, and they will lead to essential insights into different VIF levels for the invasive metastatic cancer cells. Enrich GO databases used Gene Ontology and Pathway Enrichment Analysis. Estimation with STRING online was to predict the functional and molecular interactions of proteins-protein with Cytoscape analysis to search and select the master genes. Using Cytoscape and STRING analysis, we presented eight genes, RhoA, Smad3, Akt1, Cdk2, Rock1, Rock2, Mapk1, and Mapk8, as the essential protein-protein interaction with vimentin involved in the invasion.",

        "abstract": "Background Colorectal neuroendocrine tumors with liver metastases (CRNELM) are associated with a poorer prognosis compared to their nonmetastatic counterparts. A comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity between primary lesions (PL) and liver metastases (LM) could provide crucial insights for enhancing clinical management strategies for these patients. Methods We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze fresh tissue samples from CRNELM patients, aiming to elucidate the variations in TME between PL and LM. Complementary multidimensional validation was achieved through spatial transcriptomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and multiplex immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence. Results Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that LM harboured a higher proportion of CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, NK cells, NKT cells, and B cells exhibiting a stress-like phenotype compared to PL. RGS5 + pericytes may play a role in the stress-like phenotype observed in immune cells within LM. MCs in PL (PL_MCs) and LM (LM_MCs) exhibit distinct activation of tumor-associated signaling pathways. Notably, COLEC11 + matrix cancer-associated fibroblasts (COLEC11_mCAFs) were found to be significantly associated with LM_MCs. Cell communication analysis unveiled potential targetable receptor-ligand interactions between COLEC11_mCAFs and LM_MCs. Multidimensional validation confirmed the prominence of the characteristic stress-like phenotypes, including HSPA6_CD8_Tstr, HSPA6_NK, and COLEC11_mCAFs in LM. Moreover, a higher abundance of COLEC11_mCAFs correlated with poorer survival rates in the neuroendocrine tumor patient cohort. Conclusion Overall, our study provides the first single-cell analysis of the cellular and molecular differences between PL and LM in CRNELM patients. We identified distinct cell subsets and receptor-ligand interactions that may drive TME discrepancies and support metastatic tumor growth. These insights highlight potential therapeutic targets and inform strategies for better managing CRNELM patients.

Moreover, frizzled homolog 3 has recently reported to be expressed in colorectal adenoma specimens. In the present study, we investigated the clinical significance of frizzled homolog 3 protein in colorectal cancer patients. Using immunocytochemical staining, frizzled homolog 3 expression was examined in 186 colorectal cancer specimens, 79 colorectal adenoma specimens, 133 colorectal polyp specimens, 127 colorectal cancer specimens with lymph node and/or distant metastasis, 310 specimens of various non-colorectal cancer metastatic carcinomas and 40 specimens with simultaneous occurrence of colorectal cancer, colorectal adenoma and colorectal polyp. Statistical analysis was used to correlate frizzled homolog 3 protein expression to the clinicohistopathological factors, recurrence/metastasis and survival after follow-up for 42 months in colorectal cancer patients. Frizzled homolog 3 protein was expressed in 100% colorectal cancer specimens, 89% colorectal adenoma specimens, 75% colorectal polyp specimens and 69% normal colorectal epithelial tissues. Moreover, frizzled homolog 3 immunocytochemical scores were highly correlated with colorectal cancer progression. Furthermore, frizzled homolog 3 was expressed in a comparatively lower percentage of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma with focal and very weak staining than other metastatic tumor types. On the other hand, the frizzled homolog 3 immunocytochemical scores of colorectal adenomas with synchronous colorectal carcinomas were significantly higher than those of pure colorectal adenomas. Statistical analysis showed that frizzled homolog 3 immunocytochemical scores were associated with Dukes stage and lymph node status. Finally, stratified groups of colorectal cancer patients had significant differences in their recurrence/metastasis and survival. In conclusion, the present large-scale study has clearly showed that frizzled homolog 3 protein can generate clinically important information for colorectal cancer patients.",

            "abstract": "Tumor immune escape is an important strategy of tumor survival. There are many mechanisms of tumor immune escape, including immunosuppression, which has become a research hotspot in recent years. The programmed death ligand-1/programmed death-1 (PD-L1/PD-1) signaling pathway is an important component of tumor immunosuppression, which can inhibit the activation of T lymphocytes and enhance the immune tolerance of tumor cells, thereby achieving tumor immune escape. Therefore, targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway is an attractive strategy for cancer treatment; however, the therapeutic effectiveness of PD-L1/PD-1 remains poor. This situation requires gaining a deeper understanding of the complex and varied molecular mechanisms and factors driving the expression and activation of the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling pathway. In this review, we summarize the regulation mechanisms of the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling pathway in the tumor microenvironment and their roles in mediating tumor escape. Overall, the evidence accumulated to date suggests that induction of PD-L1 by inflammatory factors in the tumor microenvironment may be one of the most important factors affecting the therapeutic efficiency of PD-L1/PD-1 blocking.",

            "abstract": "Significance In malignant melanoma, one of the most aggressive cancers, the components of the WNT pathway are frequently deregulated and have been shown to drive self-renewal and metastatic progression of melanoma cells. Identifying tumorigenic properties of key members of the WNT signaling network in the pathogenesis of melanoma represents a pivotal task in the field and underlies successful design of targeted therapeutic approaches. In the present study, we characterized Frizzled 3 receptor (FZD3) as a critical factor underlying tumorigenic properties of aggressive human melanoma. Using in vivo and in vitro tumorigenic assays, combined with functional transcriptomics analysis of FZD3 knockdown in human patient-derived cells, we determined key signaling nodes regulated by FZD3 activity during malignant transformation. Frizzled 3 receptor (FZD3) plays an important role in the homeostasis of the neural crest and its derivatives, which give rise to pigment-synthesizing cells, melanocytes. While the role for FZD3 in specification of the melanocytic lineage from neural crest is well established, its significance in the formation of melanoma, its associated malignancy, is less understood. In this study we identified FZD3 as a critical regulator of human melanoma tumorigenesis. Down-regulation of FZD3 abrogated growth, colony-forming potential, and invasive capacity of patient-derived melanoma cells. Xenotransplantation of tumor cells with down-regulated FZD3 levels originating from melanomas carrying the BRAF(V600) mutation uniformly suppressed their capacity for tumor and metastasis formation. FZD3 knockdown leads to the down-regulation of the core cell cycle protein components (cyclins D1, E2, B1, and CDKs 1, 2, and 4) in melanomas with a hyperactive BRAF oncogene, indicating a dominant role of this receptor during melanoma pathogenesis. Enriched pathway analysis revealed that FZD3 inhibits transcriptional networks controlled by CREB5, FOXD1, and ATF3, which suppress the activity of MAPK-mediated signaling. Thus, FZD3 establishes a positive-feedback mechanism that activates MAPK signal transduction network, critical to melanoma carcinogenesis. Importantly, high levels of FZD3 mRNA were found to be correlated with melanoma advancement to metastatic stages and limited patient survival. Changes in gene-expression patterns mediated by FZD3 activity occur in the absence of nuclear β-catenin function, thus representing an important therapeutic target for the melanoma patients whose disease progresses independent of canonical WNT signaling.",

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.",

However, it is challenging to analyze them together, particularly when datasets are assayed with different technologies, because biological and technical differences are interspersed. We present Harmony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts for multiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously published algorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmony enables the integration of ~106 cells on a personal computer. We apply Harmony to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from datasets with large experimental differences, five studies of pancreatic islet cells, mouse embryogenesis datasets and the integration of scRNA-seq with spatial transcriptomics data. Harmony, for the integration of single-cell transcriptomic data, identifies broad and fine-grained populations, scales to large datasets, and can integrate sequencing- and imaging-based data.",

In this article, we provide an overview on the current knowledge about immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) applied to NENs, evaluating future perspectives in this setting of tumors. Evidence so far available for ICIs in gastroenteropancreatic (GEP)-NENs is definitively not as robust as for other tumors such as Small Cell Lung Cancer or Merkel Cell Carcinoma. In fact, with regard to the well-differentiated forms of NENs (NETs), the results obtained nowadays have been disappointing. However, the near future, might reserve interesting results for ICIs in GEP-NEN from a total of nine different ICI drugs, used throughout 19 randomised controlled trials. Such numbers highlight the growing attention gathering around NENs and ICIs, in response to the need of stronger evidences supporting such therapy. For the future, the most important aspect will be to study strategies that can make NETs more susceptible to response to ICI and, thus, enhance the effectiveness of these treatments. Therefore, the combination of conventional therapy, target therapy and immunotherapy deserve attention and warrant to be explored. A sequential chemotherapy, possibly inducing an increase in tumor mutational burden and tested before immunotherapy, could be a hypothesis deserving more consideration. A radiation treatment that increases tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, could be another approach to explore before ICIs in NENs. Equally essential will be the identification of biomarkers useful for selecting patients potentially responsive to this type of treatment.",

            "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a stromal cell population with cell-of-origin, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity, are the most essential components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Through multiple pathways, activated CAFs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, along with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and even chemoresistance. Numerous previous studies have confirmed the critical role of the interaction between CAFs and tumor cells in tumorigenesis and development. However, recently, the mutual effects of CAFs and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have been identified as another key factor in promoting tumor progression. The TIME mainly consists of distinct immune cell populations in tumor islets and is highly associated with the antitumor immunological state in the TME. CAFs interact with tumor-infiltrating immune cells as well as other immune components within the TIME via the secretion of various cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, exosomes and other effector molecules, consequently shaping an immunosuppressive TME that enables cancer cells to evade surveillance of the immune system. In-depth studies of CAFs and immune microenvironment interactions, particularly the complicated mechanisms connecting CAFs with immune cells, might provide novel strategies for subsequent targeted immunotherapies. Herein, we shed light on recent advances regarding the direct and indirect crosstalk between CAFs and infiltrating immune cells and further summarize the possible immunoinhibitory mechanisms induced by CAFs in the TME. In addition, we present current related CAF-targeting immunotherapies and briefly describe some future perspectives on CAF research in the end.",

            "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a predominant life‐threatening cancer, with liver and peritoneal metastases as the primary causes of death. Intestinal inflammation, a known CRC risk factor, nurtures a local inflammatory environment enriched with tumor cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, cancer‐associated fibroblasts, immunosuppressive cells, and secretory growth factors. The complex interactions of aberrantly expressed cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix‐remodeling enzymes promote CRC pathogenesis and evoke systemic responses that affect disease outcomes. Mounting evidence suggests that these cytokines and chemokines play a role in the progression of CRC through immunosuppression and modulation of the tumor microenvironment, which is partly achieved by the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells. These cells impart features such as cancer stem cell‐like properties, drug resistance, invasion, and formation of the premetastatic niche in distant organs, promoting metastasis and aggressive CRC growth. A deeper understanding of the cytokine‐ and chemokine‐mediated signaling networks that link tumor progression and metastasis will provide insights into the mechanistic details of disease aggressiveness and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for CRC. Here, we summarized the current knowledge of cytokine‐ and chemokine‐mediated crosstalk in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which drives immunosuppression, resistance to therapeutics, and metastasis during CRC progression. We also outlined the potential of this crosstalk as a novel therapeutic target for CRC. The major cytokine/chemokine pathways involved in cancer immunotherapy are also discussed in this review.",

            "abstract": "Angiogenesis, the sprouting of new blood vessels from existing vessels, is one of six known mechanisms employed by solid tumors to recruit blood vessels necessary for their initiation, growth, and metastatic spread. The vascular network within the tumor facilitates the transport of nutrients, oxygen, and immune cells and is regulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Nearly four decades ago, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was identified as a critical factor promoting vascular permeability and angiogenesis, followed by identification of VEGF family ligands and their receptors (VEGFRs). Since then, over a dozen drugs targeting the VEGF/VEGFR pathway have been approved for ~20 solid tumor types, usually in combination with other therapies. Initially designed to starve tumors, these agents transiently \"normalize\" tumor vessels in preclinical and clinical studies, and in the clinic, increased tumor blood perfusion or oxygenation in response to these agents is associated with improved outcomes. Nevertheless, the survival benefit has been modest in most tumor types, and there are currently no biomarkers in routine clinical use for identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment. However, the ability of these agents to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into an immunostimulatory milieu has rekindled interest, and has led to the FDA-approval of 7 different combinations of VEGF/VEGFR pathway inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockers for many solid tumors in the past 3 years. In this review, we discuss our understanding of the mechanisms of response and resistance to blocking VEGF/VEGFR, and potential strategies to develop more effective therapeutic approaches.",

Main body and conclusion Therefore, we systematically reviewed the molecular mechanisms of fibroblast‐immunocyte interactions in fibrosis, from the history of cellular evolution and cell subtype divisions to the regulatory networks between fibroblasts and immunocytes. We also discuss how these communications function in different tissue and organ statuses, as well as potential therapies targeting the reciprocal fibroblast‐immunocyte interplay in fibrosis. A comprehensive understanding of these functional cells under pathophysiological conditions and the mechanisms by which they communicate may lead to the development of effective and specific therapies targeting fibrosis.",

Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) are the most common subtype of NENs. Historically, GEP-NENs have been regarded as infrequent and slow-growing malignancies; however, recent data have demonstrated that the worldwide prevalence and incidence of GEP-NENs have increased exponentially over the last three decades. In addition, an increasing number of studies have proven that GEP-NENs result in a limited life expectancy. These findings suggested that the natural biology of GEP-NENs is more aggressive than commonly assumed. Therefore, there is an urgent need for advanced researches focusing on the diagnosis and management of patients with GEP-NENs. In this review, we have summarized the limitations and recent advancements in our comprehension of the epidemiology, clinical presentations, pathology, molecular biology, diagnosis, and treatment of GEP-NETs to identify factors contributing to delays in diagnosis and timely treatment of these patients.",

        "abstract": "Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest causes of death by cancer worldwide. Liver metastasis (LM) is the main cause of death in patients with CRC. Therefore, identification of patients with the greatest risk of liver metastasis is critical for early treatment and reduces the mortality of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Methods Initially, we characterized cell composition through single-cell transcriptome analysis. Subsequently, we employed copy number variation (CNV) and pseudotime analysis to delineate the cellular origins of LM and identify LM-related epithelial cells (LMECs). The LM-index was constructed using machine learning algorithms to forecast the relative abundance of LMECs, reflecting the risk of LM. Furthermore, we analyzed drug sensitivity and drug targeted gene expression in LMECs and patients with a high risk of LM. Finally, functional experiments were conducted to determine the biological roles of metastasis-related gene in vitro. Results Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed different immune landscapes between primary CRC and LM tumor. LM originated from chromosomal variants with copy number loss of chr1 and chr6p and copy number gain of chr7 and chr20q. We identified the LMECs cluster and found LM-associated pathways such as Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and KRAS signaling. Subsequently, we identified ten metastasis-associated genes, including SOX4, and established the LM-index, which correlates with poorer prognosis, higher stage, and advanced age. Furthermore, we screened two drugs as potential candidates for treating LM, including Linsitinib_1510, Lapatinib_1558. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated significantly elevated SOX4 expression in tumor samples compared to normal samples. Finally, in vitro experiments verified that silencing SOX4 significantly inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion. Conclusion This study reveals the possible cellular origin and driving factors of LM in CRC at the single cell level, and provides a reference for early detection of CRC patients with a high risk of LM.",

A brief overview of established predictive and prognostic molecular and genetic biomarkers in colorectal cancer therapies will be discussed. A review of the literature on imaging modalities, genetic, metabolic and other molecular markers and the subsequent outcomes in post-Y90 treatment will be presented. How these biomarkers and future biomarker research can inform locoregional treatment decisions in the clinical setting of metastatic colorectal cancer lesions of the liver will be explored. There are opportunities for personalized cancer treatment in the setting of Y90 radioembolization. The ability to predict tumor response after Ytrium-90 radioembolization therapy can greatly impact clinical decision making and enhance treatment outcomes, therefore further research into the field is needed.",

ALK inhibitors can delay the progression of ALK-driven cancers, but are of limited use owing to ALK inhibitor resistance. Here, we show that resistance to ALK inhibitor in ALK-driven neuroblastomas can be attenuated by combination treatment with a p53 activator. Either ALK inhibition or p53 activator treatment induced cell cycle arrest, whereas combination treatment induced apoptosis, and prevented tumour relapse both in vitro and in vivo. This shift toward apoptosis, and away from cell-cycle arrest, in the presence of an ALK inhibitor and a p53 activator, is mediated by inhibition of the ALK–AKT–FOXO3a axis leading to a specific upregulation of SOX4. SOX4 cooperates with p53 to upregulate the pro-apoptotic protein PUMA. These data therefore suggest a novel combination therapy strategy for treating ALK-driven neuroblastomas.",

            "abstract": "Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common cancer, and approximately 35%-55% of patients with CRC will develop hepatic metastases during the course of their disease. Surgical resection represents the only chance of long-term survival. The goal of surgery should be to resect all metastases with negative histological margins while preserving sufficient functional hepatic parenchyma. Although resection remains the only chance of long-term survival, management strategies should be tailored for each case. For patients with extensive metastatic disease who would otherwise be unresectable, the combination of advances in medical therapy, such as systemic chemotherapy (CTX), and the improvement in surgical techniques for metastatic disease, have enhanced prognosis with prolongation of the median survival rate and cure. The use of portal vein embolization and preoperative CTX may also increase the number of patients suitable for surgical treatment. Despite current treatment options, many patients still experience a recurrence after hepatic resection. More active systemic CTX agents are being used increasingly as adjuvant therapy either before or after surgery. Local tumor ablative therapies, such as microwave coagulation therapy and radiofrequency ablation therapy, should be considered as an adjunct to hepatic resection, in which resection cannot deal with all of the tumor lesions. Formulation of an individualized plan, which combines surgery with systemic CTX, is a necessary task of the multidisciplinary team. The aim of this paper is to discuss different approaches for patients that are treated due to CRC liver metastasis.",

Here, we interrogate the tumor microenvironment at single-cell resolution using scRNA-seq of 59,915 tumor and non-neoplastic cells from 8 primary and 3 metastatic samples. Tumor cells reveal novel subclonal genomic complexity and transcriptional states. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells comprise a previously unrecognized diversity of cell types, including CD8+ T cells predominantly expressing the checkpoint marker LAG3, rather than PD1 or CTLA4. V(D)J analysis shows clonally expanded T cells, indicating that they are capable of mounting an immune response. An indolent liver metastasis from a class 1B UM is infiltrated with clonally expanded plasma cells, indicative of antibody-mediated immunity. This complex ecosystem of tumor and immune cells provides new insights into UM biology, and LAG3 is identified as a potential candidate for immune checkpoint blockade in patients with high risk UM. Uveal melanoma is highly metastatic and unresponsive to checkpoint immunotherapy. Here, the authors present single-cell transcriptomics of 59,915 cells in 8 primary and 3 metastatic samples, highlighting the diversity of the tumour microenvironment.",

Aim To identify windows of opportunity for timely investigations or referrals in patients presenting with colon and rectal cancer-relevant symptoms or abnormal blood tests. Design and setting A retrospective cohort study was undertaken using linked primary care and cancer registry data for patients with colorectal cancer diagnosed in England between 2012 and 2015. Method Monthly consultation rates for relevant clinical features (change in bowel habit, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, constitutional symptoms, and other bowel symptoms) and abnormal blood test results (low haemoglobin, high platelets, and high inflammatory markers) up to 24 months pre-diagnosis were calculated. Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, and relevant comorbidities was used to estimate the most likely month when consultation rates increased above baseline. Results In total, 5033 patients with colon cancer and 2516 with rectal cancer were included. Consultations for all examined clinical features and abnormal blood tests increased in the year pre-diagnosis. Rectal bleeding was the earliest clinical feature to increase from the baseline rate: at 10 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.3 to 11.7) pre-diagnosis for colon cancer and at 8 months (95% CI = 6.1 to 9.9) pre-diagnosis for rectal cancer. Low haemoglobin, high platelets, and high inflammatory markers increased from as early as 9 months pre-diagnosis. Conclusion This study found evidence for an early increase in rates of consultation for relevant clinical features and abnormal blood tests in patients with colorectal cancer, suggesting that earlier instigation of cancer-specific investigations or referrals may be warranted in some patients who were symptomatic.",

In addition, downregulated SNHG9 expression impaired the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of OS cells. SNHG9 expression was positively regulated by the transcription factor SOX4. SNHG9 interacted with miR-214-5p as a molecular sponge and SOX4 was identified as the target of miR-214-5p. The interaction affected the expression of SNHG9, miR-214-5p, and SOX4, and regulated OS cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Therefore, the SNHG9/miR-214-5p/SOX4 feedback loop performs an important role in OS progression, and might be used as a new potential therapeutic target for the treatment for OS.",

            "abstract": ": Tumor staging according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is currently regarded as the standard for staging of patients with colorectal cancer. This system provides the strongest prognostic information for patients with early stage disease and those with advanced disease. For patients with intermediate levels of disease, it is less able to predict disease outcome. Therefore, additional prognostic markers are needed to improve the management of affected patients. Ideal markers are readily assessable on hematoxylin and eosin-stained tumor slides, and in this way are easily applicable worldwide. This review summarizes the histological features of colorectal cancer that can be used for prognostic stratification. Specifically, we refer to the different histological variants of colorectal cancer that have been identified, each of these variants carrying distinct prognostic significance. Established markers of adverse outcomes are lymphatic and venous invasion, as well as perineural invasion, but underreporting still occurs in the routine setting. Tumor budding and tumor necrosis are recent advances that may help to identify patients at high risk for recurrence. The prognostic significance of the antitumor inflammatory response has been known for quite a long time, but a lack of standardization prevented its application in routine pathology. However, scales to assess intra- and peritumoral inflammation have recently emerged, and can be expected to strengthen the prognostic significance of the pathology report.",

        "abstract": "Objective Metastasis is the major cause of cancer death. However, what types of heterogenous cancer cells in primary tumour and how they metastasise to the target organs remain largely undiscovered. Design We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analysis in primary colorectal cancer (CRC) and metastases in the liver (lCRC) or ovary (oCRC). We also conducted immunofluorescence staining and functional experiments to examine the mechanism. Results Integrative analyses of epithelial cells reveal a stem-like cell cluster with high protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) and achaete scute-like 2 (ASCL2) expression as the metastatic culprit. This cell cluster comprising distinct subpopulations shows distinct liver or ovary metastatic preference. Population 1 (P1) cells with high delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) and MAF bZIP transcription factor A (MAFA) expression are enriched in primary CRC and oCRC, thus may be associated with ovarian metastasis. P3 cells having a similar expression pattern as cholangiocytes are found mainly in primary CRC and lCRC, presuming to be likely the culprits that specifically metastasise to the liver. Stem-like cells interacted with cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells via the DLL4-NOTCH signalling pathway to metastasise from primary CRC to the ovary. In the oCRC microenvironment, myofibroblasts provide cancer cells with glutamine and perform a metabolic reprogramming, which may be essential for cancer cells to localise and develop in the ovary. Conclusion We uncover a mechanism for organ-specific CRC metastasis.",

            "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular cancer without effective treatment. Here we report that polypeptide of NC1 domain of type VIII collagen (Vastatin) is an endogenous polypeptide expressed in normal liver tissue but lost in the liver of most HCC patients (73.1%). Its expression level is negatively associated with tumor size (P = 0.035) and metastasis (P = 0.016) in HCC patients. To evaluate its potential use as a therapeutic, we constructed a recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying Vastatin (rAAV-Vastatin) to treat HCC in an orthotopic Buffalo rat model. rAAV-Vastatin treatment significantly prolonged the median survival, inhibited tumor growth, and completely prevented metastasis in HCC-bearing rats by decreasing microvessel density and increasing tumor necrosis. No detectable toxicity in nontumor-bearing mice was observed. To investigate its molecular mechanisms, we performed DNA microarray, western blotting assays, and bioinformatic analysis to determine its effect on global gene expression patterns and signal transduction pathways. Our results indicated that rAAV-Vastatin significantly reduced the expressions of Pck1, JAG2, and c-Fos, thus inhibiting the cellular metabolism, Notch and AP-1 signaling pathways, respectively. Hence, we demonstrated for the first time that Vastatin is a novel, safe, and effective antiangiogenic therapeutic and a potential biomarker for HCC.",

We analyzed 373,058 single-cell transcriptomes from 63 patients, focusing on 49,155 epithelial cells. We identified a pervasive genetic and transcriptomic dichotomy of malignant cells, based on distinct gene expression, DNA copy number and gene regulatory network. We recapitulated these subtypes in bulk transcriptomes from 3,614 patients. The two intrinsic subtypes, iCMS2 and iCMS3, refine CMS. iCMS3 comprises microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) cancers and one-third of microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. iCMS3 MSS cancers are transcriptomically more similar to MSI-H cancers than to other MSS cancers. CMS4 cancers had either iCMS2 or iCMS3 epithelium; the latter had the worst prognosis. We defined the intrinsic epithelial axis of colorectal cancer and propose a refined ‘IMF’ classification with five subtypes, combining intrinsic epithelial subtype (I), microsatellite instability status (M) and fibrosis (F). A single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 63 patients with colorectal cancer classifies tumor cells into two epithelial subtypes. An improved tumor classification based on epithelial subtype, microsatellite stability and fibrosis reveals differences in pathway activation and metastasis.",

            "abstract": "Objective Haematogenous dissemination is a prevalent route of colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. However, as the gatekeeper of vessels, the role of tumour pericytes (TPCs) in haematogenous metastasis remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of TPCs and their effects on CRC metastasis. Design TPCs were isolated from patients with CRC with or without liver metastases and analysed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Clinical CRC specimens were collected to analyse the association between the molecular profiling of TPCs and CRC metastasis. RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and bisulfite-sequencing were performed to investigate the TCF21-regulated genes and mechanisms underlying integrin α5 on TCF21 DNA hypermethylation. Pericyte-conditional Tcf21-knockout mice were constructed to investigate the effects of TCF21 in TPCs on CRC metastasis. Masson staining, atomic force microscopy, second-harmonic generation and two-photon fluorescence microscopy were employed to observe perivascular extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Results Thirteen TPC subpopulations were identified by scRNA-seq. A novel subset of TCF21high TPCs, termed ‘matrix–pericytes’, was associated with liver metastasis in patients with CRC. TCF21 in TPCs increased perivascular ECM stiffness, collagen rearrangement and basement membrane degradation, establishing a perivascular metastatic microenvironment to instigate colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM). Tcf21 depletion in TPCs mitigated perivascular ECM remodelling and CRCLM, whereas the coinjection of TCF21high TPCs and CRC cells markedly promoted CRCLM. Mechanistically, loss of integrin α5 inhibited the FAK/PI3K/AKT/DNMT1 axis to impair TCF21 DNA hypermethylation in TCF21high TPCs. Conclusion This study uncovers a previously unidentified role of TPCs in haematogenous metastasis and provides a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC metastasis.",

We generated 41,892 CD45− nonimmune cells and 196,473 CD45+ immune cells from 27 samples of six CRC patients, and found that CD8_CXCL13 and CD4_CXCL13 subsets increased significantly in liver metastatic samples that exhibited high proliferation ability and tumor-activating characterization, contributing to better prognosis of patients. Distinct fibroblast profiles were observed in primary and liver metastatic tumors. F3+ fibroblasts enriched in primary tumors contributed to worse overall survival by expressing protumor factors. However, MCAM+ fibroblasts enriched in liver metastatic tumors might promote generation of CD8_CXCL13 cells through Notch signaling. In summary, we extensively analyzed the transcriptional differences of cell atlas between primary and liver metastatic tumors of CRC by single-cell and spatial transcriptome RNA sequencing, providing different dimensions of the development of liver metastasis in CRC.",

            "abstract": "Cancer immunosurveillance is critical for the elimination of neoplastic cells. In addition, recent advances in immunological checkpoint blockade drugs have revealed the importance of the immune system in cancer treatment. As a component of the immune system, CD8+ T cells have important roles in suppressing tumors. CD8+ T cells can kill tumor cells with cytotoxic molecules, such as granzymes and perforin. IFNγ, which is produced by CD8+ T cells, can increase the expression of MHC class I antigens by tumor cells, thereby rendering them better targets for CD8+ T cells. IFNγ also has crucial functions in enhancing the antitumor abilities of other immune cells. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that antitumor immunity could be improved by modulating the activity of CD8+ T cells. The Notch pathway regulates CD8+ T cells in multiple ways. It directly upregulates mRNA expression of granzyme B and perforin, enhances differentiation toward short-lived effector cells, and maintains memory T cells. Intriguingly, CD8+ T cell-specific Notch2 deletion impairs antitumor immunity, whereas the stimulation of the Notch pathway can increase tumor suppression. In this review, we will summarize the roles of the Notch pathway in CD8+ T cells and discuss issues and implications for its use in antitumor immunity.",

Here we implement single-cell PCR gene-expression analysis to dissect the cellular composition of primary human normal colon and colon cancer epithelia. We show that human colon cancer tissues contain distinct cell populations whose transcriptional identities mirror those of the different cellular lineages of normal colon. By creating monoclonal tumor xenografts from injection of a single (n = 1) cell, we demonstrate that the transcriptional diversity of cancer tissues is largely explained by in vivo multilineage differentiation and not only by clonal genetic heterogeneity. Finally, we show that the different gene-expression programs linked to multilineage differentiation are strongly associated with patient survival. We develop two-gene classifier systems (KRT20 versus CA1, MS4A12, CD177, SLC26A3) that predict clinical outcomes with hazard ratios superior to those of pathological grade and comparable to those of microarray-derived multigene expression signatures.",

The tumor microenvironment (TME) profiling enables the discovery of potential therapeutic targets. Here, we profile 54,103 cells from tumor and adjacent tissues to characterize cellular composition and elucidate the potential origin and regulation of tumor-enriched cell types in CRC. We demonstrate that the tumor-specific FAP+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages were positively correlated in 14 independent CRC cohorts containing 2550 samples and validate their close localization by immuno-fluorescent staining and spatial transcriptomics. This interaction might be regulated by chemerin, TGF-β, and interleukin-1, which would stimulate the formation of immune-excluded desmoplasic structure and limit the T cell infiltration. Furthermore, we find patients with high FAP or SPP1 expression achieved less therapeutic benefit from an anti-PD-L1 therapy cohort. Our results provide a potential therapeutic strategy by disrupting FAP+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages interaction to improve immunotherapy. Tumour microenvironment profiling during colorectal cancer progression may enable the discovery of therapeutic targets. Here, single cell and spatial RNA sequencing of tumour and adjacent normal tissues reveals an interaction between FAP+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages that could be disrupted as an immunotherapy strategy.",

        "abstract": "Differences in prognostic outcomes are prevalent in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Comparative analysis of tissue samples, particularly applying single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology, can provide a deeper understanding of potential impacting factors. However, long-term monitoring for prognosis determination necessitates extended preservation of tissue samples using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) treatments, which can cause substantial RNA degradation, presenting challenges to single-cell or single-nucleus sequencing. In this study, employing snRandom-seq, a single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) technology specifically for FFPE samples, we tested multiple lesion samples from 18 distinctive colorectal cancer liver metastasis cases with diverse prognostic outcomes that have been preserved for at least three years (mostly over five years). The process yielded expression data from 82,285 cells. The high-quality snRNA-seq data demonstrate the feasibility of single-nucleus sequencing in long-term preserved FFPE samples, offering potential insights into the heterogeneity between different prognoses of colorectal cancer liver metastases, and the relationship between the heterogeneity within different lesions of the same patient and prognosis.",

Hundreds of single-cell sequencing datasets have already been published. However, studies are frequently deposited as raw data, a format difficult to access for biological researchers due to the need for data processing using complex computational pipelines. We have implemented an online database, PanglaoDB, accessible through a user-friendly interface that can be used to explore published mouse and human single cell RNA sequencing studies. PanglaoDB contains pre-processed and pre-computed analyses from more than 1054 single-cell experiments covering most major single cell platforms and protocols, based on more than 4 million cells from a wide range of tissues and organs. The online interface allows users to query and explore cell types, genetic pathways and regulatory networks. In addition, we have established a community-curated cell-type marker compendium, containing more than 6000 gene-cell-type associations, as a resource for automatic annotation of cell types.",

In this work we introduce COMET, a computational framework for the identification of candidate marker panels consisting of one or more genes for cell populations of interest identified with single-cell RNA-seq data. We show that COMET outperforms other methods for the identification of single-gene panels, and enables, for the first time, prediction of multi-gene marker panels ranked by relevance. Staining by flow-cytometry assay confirmed the accuracy of COMET’s predictions in identifying marker-panels for cellular subtypes, at both the single- and multi-gene levels, validating COMET’s applicability and accuracy in predicting favorable marker-panels from transcriptomic input. COMET is a general non-parametric statistical framework and can be used as-is on various high-throughput datasets in addition to single-cell RNA-sequencing data. COMET is available for use via a web interface (http://www.cometsc.com) or a standalone software package (https://github.com/MSingerlab/COMETSC).",

            "abstract": "High-throughput single-cell sequencing technologies hold tremendous potential for defining cell types in an unbiased fashion using gene expression and epigenomic state. A key challenge in realizing this potential is integrating single-cell datasets from multiple protocols, biological contexts, and data modalities into a joint definition of cellular identity. We previously developed an approach, called linked inference of genomic experimental relationships (LIGER), that uses integrative nonnegative matrix factorization to address this challenge. Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol for using LIGER to jointly define cell types from multiple single-cell datasets. The main stages of the protocol are data preprocessing and normalization, joint factorization, quantile normalization and joint clustering, and visualization. We describe how to jointly define cell types from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) data, but similar steps apply across a wide range of other settings and data types, including cross-species analysis, single-nucleus DNA methylation, and spatial transcriptomics. Our protocol contains examples of expected results, describes common pitfalls, and relies only on our freely available, open-source R implementation of LIGER. We also provide R Markdown tutorials showing the outputs from each individual code segment. The analysis process can be performed in 1–4 h, depending on dataset size, and assumes no specialized bioinformatics training. Here, the authors describe step-by-step procedures for integrating single-cell sequencing datasets from different experiments or modalities to identify common and distinct cell types using the R-based software tool LIGER.",

However, it remains challenging to distinguish normal cell types in the tumor microenvironment from malignant cells and to resolve clonal substructure within the tumor. To address these challenges, we developed an integrative Bayesian segmentation approach called copy number karyotyping of aneuploid tumors (CopyKAT) to estimate genomic copy number profiles at an average genomic resolution of 5 Mb from read depth in high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We applied CopyKAT to analyze 46,501 single cells from 21 tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma and glioblastoma, to accurately (98%) distinguish cancer cells from normal cell types. In three breast tumors, CopyKAT resolved clonal subpopulations that differed in the expression of cancer genes, such as KRAS, and signatures, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, DNA repair, apoptosis and hypoxia. These data show that CopyKAT can aid in the analysis of scRNA-seq data in a variety of solid human tumors. Clonal subpopulations in human tumors are identified from single-cell RNA-seq data.",

Collectively, these methods are revolutionizing molecular cell biology research. In this comprehensive Review, we discuss established multi-omics technologies as well as cutting-edge and state-of-the-art methods in the field. We discuss how multi-omics technologies have been adapted and improved over the past decade using a framework characterized by optimization of throughput and resolution, modality integration, uniqueness and accuracy, and we also discuss multi-omics limitations. We highlight the impact that single-cell multi-omics technologies have had in cell lineage tracing, tissue-specific and cell-specific atlas production, tumour immunology and cancer genetics, and in mapping of cellular spatial information in fundamental and translational research. Finally, we discuss bioinformatics tools that have been developed to link different omics modalities and elucidate functionality through the use of better mathematical modelling and computational methods. Single-cell multi-omics methods are essential for characterizing cell states and types. The past decade has ushered in improvements in spatial resolution and computational data integration and in new omics modalities. Consequently, single-cell multi-omics have advanced fundamental and translational research, including, for example, in production of cell atlases and in tumour immunology therapeutics.",

However, RNA degradation in FFPE tissues often restricts their utility. In this study, we determined optimal FFPE preparation conditions, including tissue ischemia at 4°C (<48 h) or 25°C for a short time (0.5 h), 48-h fixation at 25°C and sampling from FFPE scrolls instead of sections. Notably, we observed an increase in intronic reads and a significant change in gene rank based on expression level in the FFPE as opposed to fresh-frozen (FF) samples. Additionally, we found that more reads were mapped to genes associated with chemical stimulus in FFPE samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that more degraded genes in FFPE samples were enriched in genes with short transcripts and high free energy. Besides, we found 40 housekeeping genes exhibited stable expression in FF and FFPE samples across various tissues. Moreover, our study showed that FFPE samples yielded comparable results to FF samples in dimensionality reduction and pathway analyses between case and control samples. Our study established the optimal conditions for FFPE preparation and identified gene attributes associated with degradation, which would provide useful clues for the utility of FFPE tissues in clinical practice and research.",

        "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play an important role in metastasis and recurrence. However, which cells comprise the complex tumor lineages in recurrence and are key in metastasis are unknown in colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC with high expression of POU5F1 has a poor prognosis with a high incidence of liver metastatic recurrence. We aim to reveal the key cells promoting metastasis and identify treatment-resistant lineages with established EGFP-expressing organoids in two-dimensional culture (2DOs) under the POU5F1 promotor. POU5F1-expressing cells are highly present in relapsed clinical patients’ blood as CTCs. Sorted POU5F1-expressing cells from 2DOs have cancer stem cell abilities and abundantly form liver metastases in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing of 2DOs identifies heterogeneous populations derived from POU5F1-expressing cells and the Wnt signaling pathway is enriched in POU5F1-expressing cells. Characteristic high expression of CTLA4 is observed in POU5F1-expressing cells and immunocytochemistry confirms the co-expression of POU5F1 and CTLA4. Demethylation in some CpG islands at the transcriptional start sites of POU5F1 and CTLA4 is observed. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor, XAV939, prevents the adhesion and survival of POU5F1-expressing cells in vitro. Early administration of XAV939 also completely inhibits liver metastasis induced by POU5F1-positive cells. A small population POU5F1-positive circulating tumor cells (CTC) have cancer stem cell abilities and contribute to colorectal cancer aggressiveness and metastasis.",

Although screening programmes including the implementation of faecal occult blood test and colonoscopy might be able to reduce mortality by removing precursor lesions and by making diagnosis at an earlier stage, the burden of disease and mortality is still high. Improvement of diagnostic and treatment options increased staging accuracy, functional outcome for early stages as well as survival. Although high quality surgery is still the mainstay of curative treatment, the management of CRC must be a multi-modal approach performed by an experienced multi-disciplinary expert team. Optimal choice of the individual treatment modality according to disease localization and extent, tumour biology and patient factors is able to maintain quality of life, enables long-term survival and even cure in selected patients by a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Treatment decisions must be based on the available evidence, which has been the basis for this consensus conference-based guideline delivering a clear proposal for diagnostic and treatment measures in each stage of rectal and colon cancer and the individual clinical situations. This ESMO guideline is recommended to be used as the basis for treatment and management decisions.",

We present a novel approach for investigating transcriptomic differences between primary colorectal cancers (CRC) and distant metastases, which may help to identify primary tumors with high risk for future dissemination and to inform the development of metastasis-targeted therapies. To effectively compare the transcriptomes of primary CRC and metastatic lesions at both the gene and pathway levels, we eliminated tissue specificity of the \"host\" organs where tumors are located and adjusted for confounders such as exposure to chemotherapy and radiation, and identified that metastases were characterized by reduced epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) but increased MYC target and DNA repair pathway activities. FBN2 and MMP3 were the most differentially expressed genes between primary tumors and metastases. The two subtypes of CRC metastases that were identified, EMT-inflammatory and proliferative, were distinct from the consensus molecular subtype (CMS) 3 suggesting subtype exclusivity. In summary, this study highlights transcriptomic differences between primary tumors and CRC metastases and delineates pathways that are activated in metastases that could be targeted in CRC patients with metastatic disease.",

            "abstract": "Hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC) accounts for < 5% of all colorectal cancer cases. Some of the unique characteristics commonly encountered in HCRC cases include early age of onset, synchronous/metachronous cancer occurrence, and multiple cancers in other organs. These characteristics necessitate different management approaches, including diagnosis, treatment or surveillance, from sporadic colorectal cancer management. There are two representative HCRC, named familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome. Other than these two HCRC syndromes, related disorders have also been reported. Several guidelines for hereditary disorders have already been published worldwide. In Japan, the first guideline for HCRC was prepared by the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum (JSCCR), published in 2012 and revised in 2016. This revised version of the guideline was immediately translated into English and published in 2017. Since then, several new findings and novel disease concepts related to HCRC have been discovered. The currently diagnosed HCRC rate in daily clinical practice is relatively low; however, this is predicted to increase in the era of cancer genomic medicine, with the advancement of cancer multi-gene panel testing or whole genome testing, among others. Under these circumstances, the JSCCR guidelines 2020 for HCRC were prepared by consensus among members of the JSCCR HCRC Guideline Committee, based on a careful review of the evidence retrieved from literature searches, and considering the medical health insurance system and actual clinical practice settings in Japan. Herein, we present the English version of the JSCCR guidelines 2020 for HCRC.",

            "abstract": "Theoretical methods, such as molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics, are very useful in understanding differences in interactions at the single molecule level. In the life sciences, small conformational changes, including substituent modifications, often have a significant impact on function in vivo. Changes in binding interactions between nucleic acid molecules and binding proteins are a prime example. In this study, we propose a strategy to predict the complex structure of DNA-binding proteins with arbitrary DNA and analyze the differences in their interactions. We tested the utility of our strategy using the anticancer drug trifluoro-thymidine (FTD), which exerts its pharmacological effect by incorporation into DNA, and confirmed that the binding affinity of the BCL-2-associated X sequence to the p53 tetramer is increased by FTD incorporation. On the contrary, in p53-binding sequences extracted from FTD-resistant cells, the binding affinity of DNA containing FTD was found to be greatly reduced compared to normal DNA. This suggests that thymidine randomly substituted for FTD in resistant cells may acquire resistance by entering a position that inhibits binding to DNA-binding proteins. We believe that this is a versatile procedure that can also take energetics into account and will increase the importance of computational science in the life sciences.",

        "abstract": "Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the second-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide with metastases being the main cause of cancer-related death. Here, we investigated the genomic and transcriptomic alterations in matching adjacent normal tissues, primary tumors, and metastatic tumors of CRC patients. Methods We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS), multi-region whole exome sequencing (WES), simultaneous single-cell RNA-Seq, and single-cell targeted cDNA Sanger sequencing on matching adjacent normal tissues, primary tumors, and metastatic tumors from 12 metastatic colorectal cancer patients ( n =84 for genomes, n =81 for exomes, n =9120 for single cells). Patient-derived tumor organoids were used to estimate the anti-tumor effects of a PPAR inhibitor, and self-renewal and differentiation ability of stem cell-like tumor cells. Results We found that the PPAR signaling pathway was prevalently and aberrantly activated in CRC tumors. Blocking of PPAR pathway both suppressed the growth and promoted the apoptosis of CRC organoids in vitro, indicating that aberrant activation of the PPAR signaling pathway plays a critical role in CRC tumorigenesis. Using matched samples from the same patient, distinct origins of the metastasized tumors between lymph node and liver were revealed, which was further verified by both copy number variation and mitochondrial mutation profiles at single-cell resolution. By combining single-cell RNA-Seq and single-cell point mutation identification by targeted cDNA Sanger sequencing, we revealed important phenotypic differences between cancer cells with and without critical point mutations ( KRAS and TP53 ) in the same patient in vivo at single-cell resolution. Conclusions Our data provides deep insights into how driver mutations interfere with the transcriptomic state of cancer cells in vivo at a single-cell resolution. Our findings offer novel knowledge on metastatic mechanisms as well as potential markers and therapeutic targets for CRC diagnosis and therapy. The high-precision single-cell RNA-seq dataset of matched adjacent normal tissues, primary tumors, and metastases from CRCs may serve as a rich resource for further studies.",

RNA staining methods assay only a small number of transcripts, whereas single-cell RNA-seq, which measures global gene expression, separates cells from their native spatial context. Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems.",

            "abstract": "Tumors of the gastrointestinal tract are among the most frequent human malignancies and account for approximately 30% of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that control diverse cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. Owing to their involvement in so many processes, they play crucial roles also in the development and physiology of the gastrointestinal tract. Consistently, PPARs deregulation has been implicated in several pathophysiological conditions, including chronic inflammation and cancer development. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on the role that the various PPAR isoforms play in the pathogenesis of the esophageal, gastric, and intestinal cancer. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying PPARs' signaling pathways will provide insights into their possible use as predictive biomarkers in the initial stages of the process. In addition, this understanding will provide the basis for new molecular targets in cancer therapy and chemoprevention.",

Some nuclear hormone receptors play an important role in regulating nutrient metabolism and energy homeostasis. Among these receptors, special attention has been focused on the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in colorectal cancer, because PPARs are involved in regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. PPARs are ligand-activated intracellular transcription factors. The PPAR subfamily consists of three subtypes encoded by distinct genes named PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. PPARγ is the most extensively studied subtype of PPARs. Even though many investigators have studied the expression and clinical implications of PPARs in colorectal cancer, there are still many controversies about the role of PPARs in colorectal cancer. In this paper, the recent progresses in understanding the role of PPARs in colorectal cancer are summarized.",

However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constituent cell types. Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves-all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology, and disease.",

The aim of this study was to analyze developments in incidence, treatment and survival for patients diagnosed with CRC in the Netherlands. For this population‐based retrospective cohort study, all patients diagnosed with CRC between 1989 and 2014 in the Netherlands were identified using data of the nationwide population‐based Netherlands Cancer Registry (n = 267,765), with follow‐up until January 1, 2016. Analyses were performed for trends in incidence, mortality, stage distribution, treatment and relative survival measured from the time of diagnosis. The incidence of both colon and rectal cancer has risen. The use of postoperative chemotherapy for Stage III colon cancer increased (14–60%), as well as the use of preoperative (chemo)radiotherapy for rectal cancer (2–66%). The administration of systemic therapy and metastasectomy increased for Stage IV disease patients. The 5‐year relative survival increased significantly from 53 to 62% for colon cancer and from 51 to 65% for rectal cancer. Ongoing advancements in treatment, and also improvement in other factors in the care of CRC patients—such as diagnostics, dedicated surgery and pre‐ and postoperative care—lead to a continuous improvement in the relative survival of CRC patients. The increasing incidence of CRC favors the implementation of the screening program, of which the effects should be monitored closely.",

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6%), prostate cancer (7.1%), and colorectal cancer (6.1%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2%), stomach cancer (8.2%), and liver cancer (8.2%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high‐quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence‐based cancer control programs, are not available in most low‐ and middle‐income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

Here we investigate inter- and intra-lesion heterogeneity for two types of metastases that associate with different clinical outcomes: lymph node and distant organ metastases in human colorectal cancer. We develop a rigorous mathematical framework for quantifying metastatic phylogenetic diversity. Distant metastases are typically monophyletic and genetically similar to each other. Lymph node metastases, in contrast, display high levels of inter-lesion diversity. We validate these findings by analyzing 317 multi-region biopsies from an independent cohort of 20 patients. We further demonstrate higher levels of intra-lesion heterogeneity in lymph node than in distant metastases. Our results show that fewer primary tumor lineages seed distant metastases than lymph node metastases, indicating that the two sites are subject to different levels of selection. Thus, lymph node and distant metastases develop through fundamentally different evolutionary mechanisms. Analysis of metastases using a mathematical framework and multi-region sampling data shows that lymph node metastases have higher levels of intratumor heterogeneity than distant metastases, and that these form via different evolutionary mechanisms.",

Base editing within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), however, has thus far been hindered by challenges associated with the delivery of guide RNA into the mitochondria 4 . As a consequence, manipulation of mtDNA to date has been limited to the targeted destruction of the mitochondrial genome by designer nucleases 9 , 10 .Here we describe an interbacterial toxin, which we name DddA, that catalyses the deamination of cytidines within dsDNA. We engineered split-DddA halves that are non-toxic and inactive until brought together on target DNA by adjacently bound programmable DNA-binding proteins. Fusions of the split-DddA halves, transcription activator-like effector array proteins, and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor resulted in RNA-free DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) that catalyse C•G-to-T•A conversions in human mtDNA with high target specificity and product purity. We used DdCBEs to model a disease-associated mtDNA mutation in human cells, resulting in changes in respiration rates and oxidative phosphorylation. CRISPR-free DdCBEs enable the precise manipulation of mtDNA, rather than the elimination of mtDNA copies that results from its cleavage by targeted nucleases, with broad implications for the study and potential treatment of mitochondrial disorders. An interbacterial toxin that catalyses the deamination of cytidines within double-stranded DNA forms part of a CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editing system that enables manipulation of human mitochondrial DNA.",

        "abstract": "Background The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a dynamic system orchestrated by intricate cell-to-cell crosstalk. Specifically, macrophages within the TME play a crucial role in driving tumor progression. Exosomes are key mediators of communication between tumor cells and the TME. However, the mechanisms underlying exosome-driven crosstalk between tumor cells and macrophages during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression remain incompletely elucidated. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing were analyzed using the Seurat package. Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blot. miRNAs differentially expressed in exosomes were analyzed using the limma package. CD206 expression in CRC tissues, exosomes tracing, and exosomal miR-106a-5p transport were observed through immunofluorescence. Macrophage polarization was assessed via qRT-PCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The interactions between miR-106a-5p, hnRNPA1, and SOCS6 were evaluated using miRNA pull-down, RIP, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Transwell assays and liver metastasis model explored the role of exosomal miR-106a-5p-induced M2 macrophages in promoting CRC liver metastasis. Result The proportion of M2 macrophages is increased in CRC with liver metastasis compared to those without. Highly metastatic CRC cells release exosomes enriched with miR-106a-5p, which promote macrophages M2 polarization by suppressing SOCS6 and activating JAK2/STAT3 pathway. These M2 macrophages reciprocally enhance CRC liver metastasis. hnRNPA1 regulate the transport of miR-106a-5p into exosomes. Clinically, elevated miR-106a-5p in plasma exosomes correlated with liver metastasis and poor prognosis. Conclusion CRC-derived exosomal miR-106a-5p plays a critical role in promoting liver metastasis and is a potential biomarker for the prevention and treatment of CRC liver metastasis.

            "abstract": "BackgroundCisplatin resistance is a major challenge for advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing effective strategies against cisplatin resistance are highly desired in the clinic. However, how tumor stroma modulates HNC growth and chemoresistance is unclear.ResultsWe show that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are intrinsically resistant to cisplatin and have an active role in regulating HNC cell survival and proliferation by delivering functional miR-196a from CAFs to tumor cells via exosomes. Exosomal miR-196a then binds novel targets, CDKN1B and ING5, to endow HNC cells with cisplatin resistance. Exosome or exosomal miR-196a depletion from CAFs functionally restored HNC cisplatin sensitivity. Importantly, we found that miR-196a packaging into CAF-derived exosomes might be mediated by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1). Moreover, we also found that high levels of plasma exosomal miR-196a are clinically correlated with poor overall survival and chemoresistance.ConclusionsThe present study finds that CAF-derived exosomal miR-196a confers cisplatin resistance in HNC by targeting CDKN1B and ING5, indicating miR-196a may serve as a promising predictor of and potential therapeutic target for cisplatin resistance in HNC.",

            "abstract": "Rationale: Reciprocal interactions between leukemic cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSC) remodel the normal niche into a malignant niche, leading to leukemia progression. Exosomes have emerged as an essential mediator of cell-cell communication. Whether leukemic exosomes involved in bone marrow niche remodeling remains unknown. Methods: We investigated the role of leukemic exosomes in molecular and functional changes of BMMSC in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics were employed to screen for miRNAs that are selectively sorted into leukemic exosomes and the corresponding RNA binding proteins. Results: We demonstrated that leukemia cells significantly inhibited osteogenesis by BMMSC both in vivo and in vitro. Some tumor suppressive miRNAs, especially miR-320, were enriched in exosomes and thus secreted by leukemic cells, resulting in increased proliferation of the donor cells. In turn, the secreted exosomes were significantly endocytosed by adjacent BMMSC and thus inhibited osteogenesis at least partially via β-catenin inhibition. Mechanistically, miR-320 and some other miRNAs were sorted out into the exosomes by RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1), as these miRNAs harbor the recognition site for HNRNPA1. Conclusion: HNRNPA1-mediated exosomal transfer of miR-320 from leukemia cells to BMMSC is an important mediator of leukemia progression and is a potential therapeutic target for CML.",

            "abstract": "This article provides an update on the global cancer burden using the GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2‐fold to 3‐fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2‐fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.",

Notably, immunotherapies have raised hope for a successful control of these advanced diseases, but their therapeutic responses are suboptimal and vary considerably among individuals. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are often correlated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance, including immunotherapies. Thus, a deeper understanding of the complex roles of TAMs in immunotherapy regulation could provide new insight into the TME. Furthermore, targeting of TAMs is an emerging field of interest due to the hope that these strategies will synergize with current immunotherapies. In this review, we summarize recent studies investigating the involvement of TAMs in immune checkpoint inhibition, tumor vaccines and adoptive cell transfer therapies, and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting TAMs as an adjuvant therapy in tumor immunotherapies.",

            "abstract": "Background Radiotherapy is a major treatment for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, HPV infection related radioresistance caused poor prognosis of ESCC. The function of SOCS6, which has been shown to be a tumor suppressor in several cancers, has not been fully investigated up till now. In this manuscript, we aim to further investigate the role of SOCS6 in regulating ESCC radioresistance. Methods Fifty-seven ESCC patients were enrolled for survival analysis. SOCS6 was stably overexpressed in HPV + ESCC and ESCC cells, and cells were treated with radiation and then subjected to colony formation assays. Expression of DNA damage repair regulating proteins were examined by Western blotting. Cell growth, cell migration and cisplatin sensitivity were then analyzed. Sphere formation assays and flow cytometry were used to investigate changes in cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy were used to locate SOCS6 and c-Kit. Ubiquitylation level of c-Kit were analyzed after immunoprecipitation. Then, coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) of SOCS6 and c-Kit were performed. In vivo, xenograft animal models were treated with radiation to examine the radiosensitivity. Results SOCS6 is correlated with better prognosis in ESCC patients. Radioresistance is impaired by SOCS6 upregulation, which inhibited cell growth, migration and increased sensitivity to cisplatin. SOCS6 significantly decreased the population of CSCs expressing the surface biomarker CD271 or CD24 low /CD44 high and their ability of sphere formation. SOCS6 and c-Kit were collocated in the cytoplasm. Blotting of ubiquitin and CoIP experiments indicated that the mechanism was related to ubiquitylation and degradation of the receptor c-Kit. Xenograft tumor mouse model showed that SOCS6 inhibited tumor growth and promoted radiosensitivity in vivo. Conclusions Our findings suggest that SOCS6 can promote the radiosensitivity of HPV + ESCC and ESCC cells and reduce their stemness via ubiquitylation and degradation of c-Kit. Thus, SOCS6 is a potential target for overcoming radioresistance of ESCC.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Numerous reports have elucidated the important participation of exosomes in the communication between tumor cells and other cancer‐related cells including tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) in microenvironment. However, the interchange of exosomes between tumor cells and TAMs in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains largely enigmatic. Herein, we discovered that LUAD cells induced the M2 polarization of TAMs and the M2‐polarized macrophages facilitated LUAD cell invasion and migration and tumor metastasis in vivo. In detail, LUAD cells secreted exosomes to transport miR‐19b‐3p into TAMs so that miR‐19b‐3p targeted PTPRD and inhibited the PTPRD‐mediated dephosphorylation of STAT3 in TAMs, leading to STAT3 activation and M2 polarization. Also, the activated STAT3 transcriptionally induced LINC00273 in M2 macrophages and exosomal LINC00273 was transferred into LUAD cells. In LUAD cells, LINC00273 recruited NEDD4 to facilitate LATS2 ubiquitination and degradation, so that the Hippo pathway was inactivated and YAP induced the transcription of RBMX. RBMX bound to miR‐19b‐3p to facilitate the packaging of miR‐19b‐3p into LUAD cell‐derived exosomes. Collectively, our results revealed the mechanism underlying the interactive communication between LUAD cells and TAMs through elucidating the exchange of exosomal miR‐19b‐3p and LINC00273 and proved the prometastatic effect of the interchange between two cells. These discoveries opened a new vision for developing LUAD treatment.",

While tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) involved in tumor malignancy, the interactions between circRNAs and TAMs in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. In the present study, we found that hsa_circ_0094606 (subsequently named circ_0094606) could promote proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as migration of PCa cells through cell viability and migration assays and the determination of EMT markers. Mass spectrometry analysis after RNA pull-down experiment identified that circ_0094606 bound to PRMT1 in PCa cells, and further functional assays revealed that circ_0094606 promoted malignant progression of PCa by binding to PRMT1. Moreover, Co-IP, GST pull-down and Immunofluorescence showed that PRMT1 mediated arginine methylation of ILF3 to stabilize the protein. Bioinformatics analysis combined with data from RIP and RNA-pull down suggested that ILF3 could stabilize IL-8 mRNA, which promoted the M2 polarization in co-culture study. Finally, in vivo experiments showed that circ_0094606 subserve PCa growth and promoted the M2 polarization of macrophages through the PRMT1/ILF3/IL-8 regulation pathway, supporting circ_0094606 as a potential novel effective target for PCa treatment.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The liver is the most frequent metastatic site for colorectal cancer (CRC). Its microenvironment is modified to provide a niche that allows CRC cell growth. This study focused on characterizing the cellular changes in the metastatic CRC (mCRC) liver tumor microenvironment (TME). Experimental Design We analyzed a series of microsatellite stable (MSS) mCRCs to the liver, paired normal liver tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). We validated our findings using multiplexed spatial imaging and bulk gene expression with cell deconvolution. Results We identified TME-specific SPP1-expressing macrophages with altered metabolism features, foam cell characteristics and increased activity for extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. SPP1+ macrophages and fibroblasts expressed complementary ligand receptor pairs with the potential to mutually influence their gene expression programs. TME lacked dysfunctional CD8 T cells and contained regulatory T cells, indicative of immunosuppression. Spatial imaging validated these cell states in the TME. Moreover, TME macrophages and fibroblasts had close spatial proximity, a requirement for intercellular communication and networking. In an independent cohort of mCRCs in the liver, we confirmed the presence of SPP1+ macrophages and fibroblasts using gene expression data. An increased proportion of TME fibroblasts was associated with worst prognosis in these patients. Conclusions We demonstrated that mCRC in the liver is characterized by transcriptional alterations of macrophages in the TME. Intercellular networking between macrophages and fibroblasts supports CRC growth in the immunosuppressed metastatic niche in the liver. These features can be used to target these immune checkpoint resistant MSS tumors. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE The liver is the commonest site for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) allow metastatic cells to seed the distant liver site and grow. Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing, we discovered a distinct SPP1+ macrophage cell state with pro-fibrogenic gene expression and altered metabolism. These SPP1+ macrophages communicated with fibroblasts, mutually influencing each other’s gene expression program. Using spatial imaging, we confirmed proximal colocalization between macrophages and fibroblasts in the mCRC TME, which is required for intercellular communication. These states and intercellular communication promoted immunosuppression in the TME, with a lack of dysfunctional anti-tumor CD8 T cells and prevalence of regulatory T cells. Increased fibroblasts were associated with worst prognosis in an independent patient cohort. Our results identified novel TME features that result in reshaping of the metastatic niche that allows progression of mCRC. These features can be potential targets for mCRC treatment, which is microsatellite stable and resistant to immune checkpoint blockade.",

To resolve inconsistencies among the reported gene expression–based CRC classifications and facilitate clinical translation, we formed an international consortium dedicated to large-scale data sharing and analytics across expert groups. We show marked interconnectivity between six independent classification systems coalescing into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) with distinguishing features: CMS1 (microsatellite instability immune, 14%), hypermutated, microsatellite unstable and strong immune activation; CMS2 (canonical, 37%), epithelial, marked WNT and MYC signaling activation; CMS3 (metabolic, 13%), epithelial and evident metabolic dysregulation; and CMS4 (mesenchymal, 23%), prominent transforming growth factor–β activation, stromal invasion and angiogenesis. Samples with mixed features (13%) possibly represent a transition phenotype or intratumoral heterogeneity. We consider the CMS groups the most robust classification system currently available for CRC—with clear biological interpretability—and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.",

Metastatic cells colonize the target organs and are capable of surviving and growing at distant sites. In this context, osteopontin (OPN) appears to be a key determinant of the crosstalk between cancer cells and the host microenvironment, which in turn modulates immune evasion. OPN is overexpressed in several human carcinomas and has been implicated in inflammation, tumor progression, and metastasis. Thus, it represents one of the most attracting targets for cancer therapy. Within the tumor mass, OPN is secreted in various forms either by the tumor itself or by stroma cells, and it can exert either pro- or antitumorigenic effects according to the cell type and tumor microenvironment. Thus, targeting OPN for therapeutic purposes needs to take into account the heterogeneous functions of the multiple OPN forms with regard to cancer formation and progression. In this review, we will describe the role of systemic, tumor-derived, and stroma-derived OPN, highlighting its pivotal role at the crossroads of inflammation and tumor progression.",

This clinical conundrum suggests that additional immune checkpoints exist. We report here that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) deficiency led to impairment of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation and allograft tumor tolerance. However, analysis of chimera mice with competitive reconstitution of WT and IRF8-KO bone marrow cells as well as mice with IRF8 deficiency only in T cells indicated that IRF8 plays no intrinsic role in CTL activation. Instead, IRF8 functioned as a repressor of osteopontin (OPN), the physiological ligand for CD44 on T cells, in CD11b+Ly6CloLy6G+ myeloid cells and OPN acted as a potent T cell suppressor. IRF8 bound to the Spp1 promoter to repress OPN expression in colon epithelial cells, and colon carcinoma exhibited decreased IRF8 and increased OPN expression. The elevated expression of OPN in human colon carcinoma was correlated with decreased patient survival. Our data indicate that myeloid and tumor cell–expressed OPN acts as an immune checkpoint to suppress T cell activation and confer host tumor immune tolerance.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal changes within individual cell populations during pulmonary fibrosis that are important for disease pathogenesis. Objectives: To determine whether single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal disease-related heterogeneity within alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, or other cell types in lung tissue from subjects with pulmonary fibrosis compared with control subjects. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on lung tissue obtained from eight transplant donors and eight recipients with pulmonary fibrosis and on one bronchoscopic cryobiospy sample from a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We validated these data using in situ RNA hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and bulk RNA-sequencing on flow-sorted cells from 22 additional subjects. Measurements and Main Results: We identified a distinct, novel population of profibrotic alveolar macrophages exclusively in patients with fibrosis. Within epithelial cells, the expression of genes involved in Wnt secretion and response was restricted to nonoverlapping cells. We identified rare cell populations including airway stem cells and senescent cells emerging during pulmonary fibrosis. We developed a web-based tool to explore these data. Conclusions: We generated a single-cell atlas of pulmonary fibrosis. Using this atlas, we demonstrated heterogeneity within alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells from subjects with pulmonary fibrosis. These results support the feasibility of discovery-based approaches using next-generation sequencing technologies to identify signaling pathways for targeting in the development of personalized therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis.",

These technical artifacts are caused by cell doublets formed during cell capture and occur at a frequency proportional to the total number of sequenced cells. The presence of doublets can lead to spurious biological conclusions, which justifies the practice of sequencing fewer cells to limit doublet formation rates. Here, we present a computational doublet detection tool – DoubletFinder – that identifies doublets based solely on gene expression features. DoubletFinder infers the putative gene expression profile of real doublets by generating artificial doublets from existing scRNA-seq data. Neighborhood detection in gene expression space then identifies sequenced cells with increased probability of being doublets based on their proximity to artificial doublets. DoubletFinder robustly identifies doublets across scRNA-seq datasets with variable numbers of cells and sequencing depth, and predicts false-negative and false-positive doublets defined using conventional barcoding approaches. We anticipate that DoubletFinder will aid in scRNA-seq data analysis and will increase the throughput and accuracy of scRNA-seq experiments.",

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.",

However, it is challenging to analyze them together, particularly when datasets are assayed with different technologies, because biological and technical differences are interspersed. We present Harmony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts for multiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously published algorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmony enables the integration of ~106 cells on a personal computer. We apply Harmony to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from datasets with large experimental differences, five studies of pancreatic islet cells, mouse embryogenesis datasets and the integration of scRNA-seq with spatial transcriptomics data. Harmony, for the integration of single-cell transcriptomic data, identifies broad and fine-grained populations, scales to large datasets, and can integrate sequencing- and imaging-based data.",

We sought to understand changes in IPF lung cell transcriptomes and gain insight into innate immune aspects of pathogenesis. We investigated IPF pathogenesis using single-cell RNA-sequencing of fresh lung explants, comparing human IPF fibrotic lower lobes reflecting late disease, upper lobes reflecting early disease and normal lungs. IPF lower lobes showed increased fibroblasts, and basal, ciliated, goblet and club cells, but decreased alveolar epithelial cells, and marked alterations in inflammatory cells. We found three discrete macrophage subpopulations in normal and fibrotic lungs, one expressing monocyte markers, one highly expressing FABP4 and INHBA (FABP4hi), and one highly expressing SPP1 and MERTK (SPP1hi). SPP1hi macrophages in fibrotic lower lobes showed highly upregulated SPP1 and MERTK expression. Low-level local proliferation of SPP1hi macrophages in normal lungs was strikingly increased in IPF lungs. Co-localisation and causal modelling supported the role for these highly proliferative SPP1hi macrophages in activation of IPF myofibroblasts in lung fibrosis. These data suggest that SPP1hi macrophages contribute importantly to lung fibrosis in IPF, and that therapeutic strategies targeting MERTK and macrophage proliferation may show promise for treatment of this disease. By single-cell RNA-sequencing we identify three discrete pulmonary macrophage subsets, including one expressing highly upregulated SPP1 and proliferating in fibrotic IPF lower lobes, accompanied by marked deposition of osteopontin in the matrix http://bit.ly/2wIRNqF",

            "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a major source of treatment resistance and tumor progression. However, regulation of CSCs stemness is not entirely understood. Here, we report that TSPAN8 expression is upregulated in breast CSCs, promotes the expression of the stemness gene NANOG, OCT4, and ALDHA1, and correlates with therapeutic resistance. Mechanistically, TSPAN8 interacts with PTCH1 and inhibits the degradation of the SHH/PTCH1 complex through recruitment of deubiquitinating enzyme ATXN3. This results in the translocation of SMO to cilia, downstream gene expression, resistance of CSCs to chemotherapeutic agents, and enhances tumor formation in mice. Accordingly, expression levels of TSPAN8, PTCH1, SHH, and ATXN3 are positively correlated in human breast cancer specimens, and high TSPAN8 and ATXN3 expression levels correlate with poor prognosis. These findings reveal a molecular basis of TSPAN8-enhanced Sonic Hedgehog signaling and highlight a role for TSPAN8 in promoting cancer stemness. Tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) has been implicated in a number of different tumours, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, in breast cancer the authors highlight a role for TSPAN8 in promoting tumorigenesis through the activation of Hedgehog signalling.",

            "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex system composed of multiple cells, such as non-cancerous fibroblasts, adipocytes, immune and vascular cells, as well as signal molecules and mediators. Tumor cells recruit and reprogram other cells to produce factors that maintain tumor growth. Communication between cancerous and surrounding cells is a two-way process and engages a diverse range of mechanisms that, in consequence, can lead to rapid proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance, or can serve as a tumors-suppressor, e.g., through tumor–immune cell interaction. Cross-talk within the cancer microenvironment can be direct by cell-to-cell contact via adhesion molecules, electrical coupling, and passage through gap junctions, or indirect through classical paracrine signaling by cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular vesicles. Therapeutic approaches for modulation of cell-cell communication may be a promising strategy to combat tumors. In particular, integrative approaches targeting tumor communication in combination with conventional chemotherapy seem reasonable. Currently, special attention is paid to suppressing the formation of open-ended channels as well as blocking exosome production or ablating their cargos. However, many aspects of cell-to-cell communication have yet to be clarified, and, in particular, more work is needed in regard to mechanisms of bidirectional signal transfer. Finally, it seems that some interactions in TEM can be not only cancer-specific, but also patient-specific, and their recognition would help to predict patient response to therapy.",

            "abstract": "Understanding global communications among cells requires accurate representation of cell-cell signaling links and effective systems-level analyses of those links. We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (http://www.cellchat.org/) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues. Single-cell methods record molecule expressions of cells in a given tissue, but understanding interactions between cells remains challenging. Here the authors show by applying systems biology and machine learning approaches that they can infer and analyze cell-cell communication networks in an easily interpretable way.",

            "abstract": "Malignant tumor represents a major reason for death in the world and its incidence is growing rapidly. Developing the tools for early diagnosis is possibly a promising way to offer diverse therapeutic options and promote the survival chance. Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), also called Osteopontin (OPN), has been demonstrated overexpressed in many cancers. However, the specific role of SPP1 in prognosis, gene mutations, and changes in gene and miRNA expression in human cancers is unclear. In this report, we found SPP1 expression was higher in most of the human cancers. Based on Kaplan-Meier plotter and the PrognoScan database, we found high SPP1 expression was significantly correlated with poor survival in various cancers. Using a large dataset of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), head and neck cancer (HNSC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, this study identified 22 common genes and 2 common miRNAs. GO, and KEGG paths analyses suggested that SPP1 correlated genes were mainly involved in positive regulation of immune cell activation and infiltration. SPP1-associated genes and miRNAs regulatory networks suggested that their interactions may play a role in the progression of four selected cancers. SPP1 showed significant positive correlation with the immunocyte and immune marker sets infiltrating degrees. All of these data provide strong evidence that SPP1 may promote tumor progress through interacting with carcinogenic genes and facilitating immune cells’ infiltration in COAD, HNSC, LUAD, and LUSC.",

Here, we sequenced 97 matched samples by using single-cell RNA-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics. Strikingly, metastatic microenvironment underwent remarkable spatial reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells such as MRC1+ CCL18+ M2-like macrophages. We further developed scMetabolism, a computational pipeline for quantifying single-cell metabolism, and observed that those macrophages harbored enhanced metabolic activity. Interestingly, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could block this status and restore the antitumor immune balance in responsive patients, while the non-responsive patients deteriorated into a more suppressive one. Our work described the immune evolution of metastasis and uncovered the black box of how tumors respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

            "abstract": "Background Immunotherapy in microsatellite stable colorectal or pancreatic cancer has not shown promising results. It has been hypothesized that targeting immunosuppressive molecules like SDF1-alpha/CXCL12 could contribute to immunotherapy and animal models showed promising results on T cell activation and migration in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition. Methods Here, we describe the successful application of anti-CXCL12 (NOX-A12) in patients with advanced stage pretreated metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer (OPERA trial). The treatment consisted of 2 weeks of anti-CXCL12 monotherapy with NOX-A12 followed by combination therapy with pembrolizumab (n=20 patients) until progression or intolerable toxicity had occurred. Results The treatment was safe and well tolerated with 83.8% grade I/II, 15.5% grade III and 0.7% grade V adverse events. Of note, for a majority of patients, time on trial treatment was prolonged compared with their last standard treatment preceding trial participation. Systematic serial biopsies revealed distinct patterns of modulation. Tissue and clinical responses were associated with Th1-like tissue reactivity upon CXCL12 inhibition. A downregulation of a cytokine cassette of interleukin (IL)-2/IL-16/CXCL-10 was associated with tumor resistance and furthermore linked to a rare, CXCL12-associated CD14+CD15+promonocytic population. T cells showed aggregation and directed movement towards the tumor cells in responding tissues. Serum analyses detected homogeneous immunomodulatory patterns in all patients, regardless of tissue responses. Conclusions We demonstrate that the combination of CXCL12 inhibition and checkpoint inhibition is safe and grants further exploration of synergistic combinatorial strategies.",

A comprehensive comparison of the differences between primary and metastatic cancers within the same organ can aid in understanding the growth mechanisms of cancer cells at metastatic sites, thereby helping to develop more effective targeted treatment strategies. Primary liver cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and the liver is also one of the main metastatic sites. In this paper, we utilize single-cell RNA-Seq data to compare primary liver cancer and colorectal liver metastases from multiple perspectives, including cell types and proportions, activity of various cell types, cell–cell communication, mRNA expression differences within the same types of cells, key factors associated with cell proliferation, etc. Our analysis results show the following: (i) Compared to primary tissue, metastatic tissue contains more cytotoxic T cells and exhausted T cells, and it retains some specific characteristics of the primary site. (ii) Cells of the same type exhibit functional differences between primary and metastatic cancers, with metastatic cancer cells showing lower metabolism levels and immune cells exhibiting stronger immune activity. (iii) Interactions between monocytes and hepato-associated cells are strong in primary cancer, while depleted T cells frequently communicate with hepatocytes in metastatic cancer. (iv) Proliferation-related genes in primary and metastatic cancers are mainly involved in cell energy supply and basic metabolism activity, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at http://www.bioconductor.org.",

The three central data entities of GEO are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. A platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. A sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. A series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. The GEO repository is publicly accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.",

Thus, to provide patient-specific information for personalized medicine, it is necessary to conduct differential expression analysis at the individual level.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe proposed a method to detect DE genes in individual disease samples by using the disrupted ordering in individual disease samples. In both simulated data and real paired cancer-normal sample data, this method showed excellent performance. It was found to be insensitive to experimental batch effects and data normalization. The landscape of stable gene pairs in a particular type of normal tissue could be predetermined using previously accumulated data, based on which dysregulated genes and pathways for any disease sample can be readily detected. The usefulness of the RankComp method in clinical settings was exemplified by the identification and application of prognostic markers for lung cancer.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nRankComp is implemented in R script that is freely available from Supplementary Materials.",

However, it is challenging to analyze them together, particularly when datasets are assayed with different technologies, because biological and technical differences are interspersed. We present Harmony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts for multiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously published algorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmony enables the integration of ~106 cells on a personal computer. We apply Harmony to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from datasets with large experimental differences, five studies of pancreatic islet cells, mouse embryogenesis datasets and the integration of scRNA-seq with spatial transcriptomics data. Harmony, for the integration of single-cell transcriptomic data, identifies broad and fine-grained populations, scales to large datasets, and can integrate sequencing- and imaging-based data.",

Here we show that execution of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a migratory cellular program associated with development and tumor metastasis, is fueled by upregulation of ribosome biogenesis during G1/S arrest. This unexpected EMT feature is independent of species and initiating signal, and is accompanied by release of the repressive nucleolar chromatin remodeling complex (NoRC) from rDNA, together with recruitment of the EMT-driving transcription factor Snai1 (Snail1), RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) and the Upstream Binding Factor (UBF). EMT-associated ribosome biogenesis is also coincident with increased nucleolar recruitment of Rictor, an essential component of the EMT-promoting mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). Inhibition of rRNA synthesis in vivo differentiates primary tumors to a benign, Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ERα) positive, Rictor-negative phenotype and reduces metastasis. These findings implicate the EMT-associated ribosome biogenesis program with cellular plasticity, de-differentiation, cancer progression and metastatic disease. Ribosomal DNA transcription is essential for cell growth and division. Here, the authors show that EMT is accompanied by Snail binding to rDNA operons and Rictor association with nucleoli to fuel an induction of ribosome biogenesis during G1/S cell cycle arrest and inhibition of ribosome biogenesis hampers EMT, differentiates primary tumors and reduces metastasis.",

In contrast to numerous discoveries that reveal the detailed mechanisms leading to the formation of the primary tumor, the biological underpinnings of the metastatic disease remain poorly understood. Cancer metastasis is a complex process in which cancer cells escape from the primary tumor, settle, and grow at other parts of the body. Epithelial‐mesenchymal transition and anoikis resistance of tumor cells are the main forces to promote metastasis, and multiple components in the tumor microenvironment and their complicated crosstalk with cancer cells are closely involved in distant metastasis. In addition to the three cornerstones of tumor treatment, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, novel treatment approaches including targeted therapy and immunotherapy have been established in patients with metastatic cancer. Although the cancer survival rate has been greatly improved over the years, it is still far from satisfactory. In this review, we provided an overview of the metastasis process, summarized the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the dissemination and distant metastasis of cancer cells, and reviewed the important advances in interventions for cancer metastasis.",

            "abstract": "In chronic infections and cancers, T lymphocytes (T cells) are exposed to persistent antigen or inflammatory signals. The condition is often associated with a decline in T-cell function: a state called “exhaustion”. T cell exhaustion is a state of T cell dysfunction characterized by increased expression of a series of inhibitory receptors (IRs), decreased effector function, and decreased cytokine secretion, accompanied by transcriptional and epigenetic changes and metabolic defects. The rise of immunotherapy, particularly the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has dramatically changed the clinical treatment paradigm for patients. However, its low response rate, single target and high immunotoxicity limit its clinical application. The multiple immunomodulatory potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) provides a new direction for improving the treatment of T cell exhaustion. Here, we review recent advances that have provided a clearer molecular understanding of T cell exhaustion, revealing the characteristics and causes of T cell exhaustion in persistent infections and cancers. In addition, this paper summarizes recent advances in improving T cell exhaustion in infectious diseases and cancer with the aim of providing a comprehensive and valuable source of information on TCM as an experimental study and their role in collaboration with ICIs therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background Liver metastasis poses a significant barrier to effective immunotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer. Cryoablation has emerged as a vital supplementary therapeutic approach for these patients. However, its impact on the tumor microenvironment following the ablation of liver metastases remains unclear. Methods We acquired multi-omics time-series data at 1 day, 5 days, and 14 days post-cryoablation, based on tumor and peripheral blood samples from clinical patients, cell co-culture models, and a liver metastases mouse model built on the MC38 cell line in C57BL/6 J mice. This dataset included single-cell transcriptomic sequencing, bulk tissue transcriptomic sequencing, 4D-Label-Free proteomics, flow cytometry data, western blot data, and histological immunofluorescence staining of pathological specimens. Results We found that a neutrophil-related inflammatory state persisted for at least 14 days post-cryoablation. During this period, neutrophils underwent phenotypic changes, shifting from the N1 to the N2 type. Cryoablation also caused a significant increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in neutrophils, which triggered the formation of PAD4-dependent neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), further promoting immune evasion. Moreover, animal studies demonstrated that depleting or inhibiting the CXCL2-CXCR2 signaling axis within neutrophils, or degrading NETs, could effectively restore the host’s anti-tumor immune response. Conclusions These findings underscore the critical role of neutrophils and their NETs in immune escape following cryoablation. Targeting the CXCL2-CXCR2-Ca2+-PAD4 axis could enhance the therapeutic response to PD-1 antibodies, providing a potential strategy to improve treatment outcomes for colorectal cancer with liver metastases.

The evasion of cancer cells from immune surveillance is prevented by immune checkpoint inhibitors, allowing the patient’s own immune system to attack their cancer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown improvement in overall survival for melanoma, lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma in clinical trials. Unfortunately, not all patients respond to this therapy.In cancer management, percutaneous ablation techniques are well established for both cure and local control of many tumour types. Cryoablation of the tumour tissue results in cell destruction by freezing. Contrary to heat-based ablative modalities, cryoablation induces tumour cell death by osmosis and necrosis. It is hypothesised that with necrosis, the intracellular contents of the cancer cells stay intact allowing the immune system to induce an immune-specific reaction. This immune-specific reaction can, in theory, also affect cancer cells outside the ablated tissue, known as the abscopal effect. Unfortunately, this effect is rarely observed, but when cryoablation is combined with immunotherapy, the effect of both therapies may be enhanced. Although several preclinical studies demonstrated a synergistic effect between cryoablation and immunotherapy, prospective clinical trials are needed to prove this clinical benefit for patients. In this review, we will outline the current evidence for the combination of cryoablation with immunotherapy to treat cancer.",

            "abstract": "Background The presence of liver metastasis correlates with poor therapeutic response of PD-1 blockade therapy in melanoma. A novel treatment protocol by combining cryoablation with transarterial infusion of pembrolizumab (CATAP) was proposed, and its feasibility and safety was assessed among this group of patients. Methods This registered ambispective cohort study enrolled fifteen melanoma patients with multiple hepatic metastases who received planned two-stage CATAP therapy: in the combined stage, subtotal cryoablation on day 1, in which one to two intrahepatic lesions were ablated completely with other lesions left untreated, sequentially combined transarterial infusion of pembrolizumab on day 3, every three weeks, for at least one cycle; in the infusion stage, arterial infusion of pembrolizumab was recommended at three-week interval until disease progression. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by RECIST (version 1.1); secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety; exploratory endpoints were changes of cytokines and immune cell compositions in peripheral blood samples. Results Of the 15 patients enrolled, no grade 3–4 adverse events or major complications were observed. One patient (6.7%) achieved complete response, and 3 (20.0%) achieved partial response. The overall response rates of CATAP for the entire cohort and patients with cutaneous melanoma were 26.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.3–49.0%) and 33.3% (95% CI 2.5–64.1%), respectively. Clinical response was observed in a proportion of patients (2/6; 33.3%) who failed first-line intravenous pembrolizumab treatment. The median overall PFS time and hepatic PFS time were 4.0 (95% CI 2.5–5.5) and 5.73 (95% CI 1.1–10.4) months, respectively. A significant increase in CD3-CD16 + CD56 + cells (natural killer cells; P  = 0.0124) and a marginally significant decrease in CD4 + CD25 + cells (regulatory T cells; P  = 0.0546) were observed three weeks after the first cycle of treatment in the combined stage. Conclusions The CATAP therapy demonstrated positive clinical activity and a favorable safety profile for melanoma patients with liver metastasis.",

NETosis is driven by protein-arginine deiminase type 4, with the release of intracellular granule components that function by capturing and destroying microbes, including viral, fungal, bacterial, and protozoal pathogens. The positive effects of pathogen control are countered by pro-inflammatory effects as demonstrated in a variety of diseases. Components of NETS are non-specific, and other than controlling microbes, they cause injury to surrounding tissue by themselves or by increasing the pro-inflammatory response. NETs can play a role in enhancement of the inflammation seen in autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosis. In addition, autoinflammatory diseases such as gout have been associated with NETosis. Inhibition of NETs may decrease the severity of many diseases improving survival. Herein, we describe NETosis in different diseases focusing on the detrimental effect of NETs and outline possible therapeutics that can be used to mitigate netosis. There is a need for more studies and clinical trials on these and other compounds that could prevent or destroy NETs, thereby decreasing damage to patients.",

In addition to their key role in the neutrophil innate immune response, NETs are also involved in autoimmune diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and in other non-infectious pathological processes, as coagulation disorders, thrombosis, diabetes, atherosclerosis, vasculitis, and cancer. Recently, a large body of evidence indicates that NETs are involved in cancer progression and metastatic dissemination, both in animal models and cancer patients. Interestingly, a close correlation between cancer cell recruitment of neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment (Tumor Associated Neutrophils. TANs) and NET formation has been also observed either in primary tumors and metastatic sites. Moreover, NETs can also catch circulating cancer cells and promote metastasis. Furthermore, it has been reported that wake dormant cancer cells, causing tumor relapse and metastasis. This review will primarily focus on the pro-tumorigenic activity of NETs in tumors highlighting their ability to serve as a potential target for cancer therapy.",

In this study, we highlighted the functions of histone citrullination in physiological regulation and tumors. Additionally, because histone citrullination involves forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the relationship between NETs and tumors was illustrated. Finally, the clinical application of histone citrullination and PAD inhibitors was discussed.",

To study the function of neutrophils in vivo, these cells are often depleted using Ly-6G or Gr-1 depleting antibodies or genetic “knockout” models. However, these methods have several limitations, being only partially effective, effective for a short term, and lacking specificity or the ability to conditionally deplete neutrophils. Here, we describe the use of a novel murinized Ly-6G (1A8) antibody. The murinized Ly-6G antibody is of the mouse IgG2a isotype, which is the only isotype that can bind all murine Fcγ receptors and C1q and is, therefore, able to activate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) pathways. We show that this mouse-Ly-6G antibody shows efficient, long-term, and near-complete (>90%) neutrophil depletion in the peripheral blood of C57Bl6/J, Balb/c, NXG and SCID mice for up to at least four weeks, using a standardized neutrophil depletion strategy. In addition, we show that neutrophils are efficiently depleted in the blood and tumor tissue of IMR32 tumor-bearing SCID mice, analyzed six weeks after the start of the treatment.",

This relevance is illustrated by strong correlations between high frequencies of intratumoral neutrophils and poor outcome in the majority of human cancers. Recent high‐dimensional analysis of murine neutrophils provides evidence for unexpected plasticity of neutrophils in murine models of cancer and other inflammatory non‐malignant diseases. New analysis tools enable deeper insight into the process of neutrophil differentiation and maturation. These technological and scientific developments led to the description of an ever‐increasing number of distinct transcriptional states and associated phenotypes in murine models of disease and more recently also in humans. At present, functional validation of these different transcriptional states and potential phenotypes in cancer is lacking. Current functional concepts on neutrophils in cancer rely mainly on the myeloid‐derived suppressor cell (MDSC) concept and the dichotomous and simple N1–N2 paradigm. In this manuscript, we review the historic development of those concepts, critically evaluate these concepts against the background of our own work and provide suggestions for a refinement of current concepts in order to facilitate the transition of TAN research from experimental insight to clinical translation.",

            "abstract": "Background Liver metastasis is present in a wide range of malignancies, with colorectal cancer as the most common site. Several minimally invasive treatments have been suggested for managing hepatic metastases, and cryoablation is among them, yet not widely used. In this systematic review, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of percutaneous cryoablation in all types of liver metastases. Methods A systematic search was performed in international databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, to find relevant studies reporting outcomes for percutaneous cryoablation in liver metastasis patients. In addition to baseline features such as mean age, gender, metastasis origin, and procedure details, procedure outcomes, including overall survival, local recurrence, quality of life (QoL), and complications, were extracted from the studies. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval for comparison of QoL. Results We screened 2131 articles. Fifteen studies on 692 patients were included. Mean overall survival ranged from 14.5–29 months. The rate of local recurrence in the included studies ranged from 9.4% to 78%, and local control progression-free survival ranged from 1 to 31 months. The total QoL decreased one week after the cryoablation procedure (-3.08 [95% Confidence interval: -4.65, -1.50], p-value <0.01) but increased one month (5.69 [3.99, 7.39], p-value <0.01) and three months (3.75 [2.25, 5.24], p-value <0.01) after the procedure. Conclusion Cryoablation is an effective procedure for the treatment of liver metastases, especially in cases that are poor candidates for liver resection. It could significantly improve QoL with favorable local recurrence.",

In this review, we summarize the structure–activity relationships of newly investigated PAD4 inhibitors to bring researchers up to speed by guiding and describing new scaffolds as optimization and development leads for new effective, safe, and selective cancer treatments. In addition, some recent reports have shown evidence that PAD4 inhibitors are expected to trigger antitumor immune responses, regulate immune cells and related immune factors, enhance the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and enhance their antitumor efficacy. Therefore, PAD4 inhibitors may potentially change tumor immunotherapy and provide an excellent direction for the development and clinical application of immunotherapy strategies for related diseases.",

The importance of neutrophils in cancer development has been increasingly recognized. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like structures released into the extracellular space by activated neutrophils, serving as a potential antimicrobial mechanism for capturing and eliminating microorganisms. The roles played by NETs in cancer development have been a subject of intense research in the last decade. In breast cancer, current evidence suggests that NETs are involved in various stages of cancer development, particularly during metastasis. In this review, we try to provide an updated overview of the roles played by NETs in breast cancer metastasis. These include: 1) facilitating systemic dissemination of cancer cells; 2) promoting cancer-associated inflammation; 3) facilitating cancer-associated thrombosis; 4) facilitating pre-metastatic niche formation; and 5) awakening dormant cancer cells. The translational implications of NETs in breast cancer treatment are also discussed. Understanding the relationship between NETs and breast cancer metastasis is expected to provide important insights for developing new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Liver and lung are the most common metastatic sites in colorectal cancer (CRC), where the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the progression and metastasis of CRC. Understanding the interactions between various types of cells in the TME can suggest innovative therapeutic strategies. Using single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐Seq) and clinical samples, fibroblast growth factor‐19 (FGF19, rodent FGF15) is found to mediate a significant interaction between CRC cells and cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs), activating the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)‐to‐CAFs differentiation. In various CRC metastatic mouse models, it is shown that FGF15 has a more pronounced effect on liver metastasis compared to pulmonary metastasis. More importantly, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are also identified from the RNA‐Seq dataset upon the activation of HSCs by FGF19 and compared the DEGs in matched primary and metastatic mRNA samples from patients with CRC liver metastasis (CRCLM), it is found that the ANGPTL4 gene is significantly associated with HSCs activation. Different mouse models also demonstrated the impact of the FGF19/ANGPTL4 axis on the severity of CRCLM. Importantly, disruption of this axis significantly inhibits CRCLM in vivo. This study is among the first to demonstrate the impact of the FGF19/ANGPTL4 axis on CRCLM, offering a novel therapeutic strategy.",

Multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and in vitro wound healing, cell migration and cell apoptosis assays were performed to further explore the biological relevance of identified potential regulatory molecules. In this study, approximately 17 epithelial cell subtypes were detected, with Epi‐11 cells being highly expressed in LM tissues compared with CRC samples. Furthermore, patients with high expression of the metastasis‐related genetic profile of Epi‐11 had a poorer prognosis. By predicting receptor–ligand interactions, Epi‐11 cells were found to interact more with myeloid and T/natural killer cells in LM tissues when compared to primary CRC samples, which was mediated by the PLXNB1/SEMA4D axis. In addition, high SEMA4D expression was correlated with decreased overall survival of patients with CRC, whereas PLXNB1 was not. SEMA4D knockdown prevented the migration and promoted the apoptosis of HCT116 cells in vitro. In summary, Epi‐11 cells, an important subset of epithelial cells, may drive the LM of CRC and act by crosstalk with immune cells through the PLXNB1/SEMA4D signalling axis.",

Circulating tumor cell (CTC), originating from primary tumor sites, is considered to be the precursors of tumor metastasis. However, the regulatory mechanism of TAMs in CTC-mediated tumor metastasis still remains unclear. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the macrophages infiltration (CD68 and CD163), epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin and Vimentin) expression in serial sections of human colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens. Then, the correlations between macrophages infiltration and clinicopathologic features, mesenchymal CTC ratio, and patients’ prognosis were analyzed. A co-culture assay in vitro was used to evaluate the role of TAMs on CRC EMT, migration and invasion, and ELISA, luciferase reporter assay and CHIP were performed to uncover the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, an in vivo model was carried out to confirm the effect of TAMs on mesenchymal CTC-mediated metastasis. Clinically, CD163+ TAMs infiltrated in invasive front was associated with EMT, mesenchymal CTC ratio, and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. CRC–conditioned macrophages regulated EMT program to enhance CRC cells migration and invasion by secreting IL6. TAMs-derived IL6 activated the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, and activated STAT3 transcriptionally inhibited the tumor suppressor miR-506-3p in CRC cells. miR-506-3p, a key miRNA regulating FoxQ1, was downregulated in CRC cells, resulting in increased FoxQ1 expression, which in turn led to the production of CCL2 that promoted macrophage recruitment. Inhibition of CCL2 or IL6 broke this loop and reduced macrophage migration and mesenchymal CTC-mediated metastasis, respectively. Our data indicates that TAMs induce EMT program to enhance CRC migration, invasion, and CTC-mediated metastasis by regulating the JAK2/STAT3/miR-506-3p/FoxQ1 axis, which in turn leads to the production of CCL2 that promote macrophage recruitment, revealing a new cross-talk between immune cells and tumor cells in CRC microenvironment.",

Here, we investigated the genomic and transcriptomic alterations in matching adjacent normal tissues, primary tumors, and metastatic tumors of CRC patients. Methods We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS), multi-region whole exome sequencing (WES), simultaneous single-cell RNA-Seq, and single-cell targeted cDNA Sanger sequencing on matching adjacent normal tissues, primary tumors, and metastatic tumors from 12 metastatic colorectal cancer patients ( n =84 for genomes, n =81 for exomes, n =9120 for single cells). Patient-derived tumor organoids were used to estimate the anti-tumor effects of a PPAR inhibitor, and self-renewal and differentiation ability of stem cell-like tumor cells. Results We found that the PPAR signaling pathway was prevalently and aberrantly activated in CRC tumors. Blocking of PPAR pathway both suppressed the growth and promoted the apoptosis of CRC organoids in vitro, indicating that aberrant activation of the PPAR signaling pathway plays a critical role in CRC tumorigenesis. Using matched samples from the same patient, distinct origins of the metastasized tumors between lymph node and liver were revealed, which was further verified by both copy number variation and mitochondrial mutation profiles at single-cell resolution. By combining single-cell RNA-Seq and single-cell point mutation identification by targeted cDNA Sanger sequencing, we revealed important phenotypic differences between cancer cells with and without critical point mutations ( KRAS and TP53 ) in the same patient in vivo at single-cell resolution. Conclusions Our data provides deep insights into how driver mutations interfere with the transcriptomic state of cancer cells in vivo at a single-cell resolution. Our findings offer novel knowledge on metastatic mechanisms as well as potential markers and therapeutic targets for CRC diagnosis and therapy. The high-precision single-cell RNA-seq dataset of matched adjacent normal tissues, primary tumors, and metastases from CRCs may serve as a rich resource for further studies.",

            "abstract": "Objective Haematogenous dissemination is a prevalent route of colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. However, as the gatekeeper of vessels, the role of tumour pericytes (TPCs) in haematogenous metastasis remains largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of TPCs and their effects on CRC metastasis. Design TPCs were isolated from patients with CRC with or without liver metastases and analysed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Clinical CRC specimens were collected to analyse the association between the molecular profiling of TPCs and CRC metastasis. RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing and bisulfite-sequencing were performed to investigate the TCF21-regulated genes and mechanisms underlying integrin α5 on TCF21 DNA hypermethylation. Pericyte-conditional Tcf21-knockout mice were constructed to investigate the effects of TCF21 in TPCs on CRC metastasis. Masson staining, atomic force microscopy, second-harmonic generation and two-photon fluorescence microscopy were employed to observe perivascular extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Results Thirteen TPC subpopulations were identified by scRNA-seq. A novel subset of TCF21high TPCs, termed ‘matrix–pericytes’, was associated with liver metastasis in patients with CRC. TCF21 in TPCs increased perivascular ECM stiffness, collagen rearrangement and basement membrane degradation, establishing a perivascular metastatic microenvironment to instigate colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM). Tcf21 depletion in TPCs mitigated perivascular ECM remodelling and CRCLM, whereas the coinjection of TCF21high TPCs and CRC cells markedly promoted CRCLM. Mechanistically, loss of integrin α5 inhibited the FAK/PI3K/AKT/DNMT1 axis to impair TCF21 DNA hypermethylation in TCF21high TPCs. Conclusion This study uncovers a previously unidentified role of TPCs in haematogenous metastasis and provides a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC metastasis.",

            "abstract": "Rationale: Patients with colorectal cancer die mainly due to liver metastases (CRC-LM). Although the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in tumor development and therapeutic response, our understanding of the individual TME components, especially cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), remains limited. Methods: We analyzed CRC-LM CAFs and cancer cells by single-cell transcriptomics and used bioinformatics for data analysis and integration with related available single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. We validated key findings by RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Results: By single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 4,397 CAFs from six CRC-LM samples, we identified two main CAF populations, contractile CAFs and extracellular matrix (ECM)-remodeling/pro-angiogenic CAFs, and four subpopulations with distinct phenotypes. We found that ECM-remodeling/pro-angiogenic CAFs derive from portal resident fibroblasts. They associate with areas of strong desmoplastic reaction and Wnt signaling in low-proliferating tumor cells engulfed in a stiff extracellular matrix. By integrating public single-cell primary liver tumor data, we propose a model to explain how different liver malignancies recruit CAFs of different origins to this organ. Lastly, we found that LTBP2 plays an important role in modulating collagen biosynthesis, ECM organization, and adhesion pathways. We developed fully human antibodies against LTBP2 that depleted LTBP2+ CAFs in vitro. Conclusion: This study complements recent reports on CRC-LM CAF heterogeneity at the single-cell resolution. The number of sequenced CAFs was more than one order of magnitude larger compared to existing data. LTBP2 targeting by antibodies might create opportunities to deplete ECM-remodeling CAFs in CRC-LMs. This might be combined with other therapies, e.g., anti-angiogenic compounds as already done in CRC. Moreover, we showed that in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, in which ECM-remodeling CAF proportion is similar to that of CRC-LM, several genes expressed by ECM-remodeling CAFs, such as LTBP2, were associated with survival.",

How to improve therapeutic options for patients with metastatic CRC is the core question for CRC treatment. However, the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC have not been fully understood, and the influence of stromal cells on response to chemotherapy is unclear. Here we performed an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional landscape of primary CRC, matched liver metastases and blood at single-cell resolution, and a systematic examination of transcriptional changes and phenotypic alterations of the TME in response to preoperative chemotherapy (PC). Based on 111,292 single-cell transcriptomes, our study reveals that TME of treatment-naïve tumors is characterized by the higher abundance of less-activated B cells and higher heterogeneity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). By contrast, in tumors treated with PC, we found activation of B cells, lower diversity of TAMs with immature and less activated phenotype, lower abundance of both dysfunctional T cells and ECM-remodeling cancer-associated fibroblasts, and an accumulation of myofibroblasts. Our study provides a foundation for future investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying liver metastasis of CRC and its response to PC, and opens up new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies for CRC.",

Distinct fibroblast profiles were observed in primary and liver metastatic tumors. F3+ fibroblasts enriched in primary tumors contributed to worse overall survival by expressing protumor factors. However, MCAM+ fibroblasts enriched in liver metastatic tumors might promote generation of CD8_CXCL13 cells through Notch signaling. In summary, we extensively analyzed the transcriptional differences of cell atlas between primary and liver metastatic tumors of CRC by single-cell and spatial transcriptome RNA sequencing, providing different dimensions of the development of liver metastasis in CRC.",

            "abstract": "Background Despite evidence supporting the high correlation of the novel platelet-to-albumin ratio (PAR) with survival in diverse malignancies, its prognostic relevance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains underexplored. This study aimed to examine the link between PAR and overall survival (OS) in NPC and to establish a predictive model based on this biomarker. Methods We retrospectively assembled a cohort consisting of 858 NPC patients who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Utilizing the maximally selected log-rank method, we ascertained the optimal cut-off point for the PAR. Subsequently, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were employed to discern factors significantly associated with OS and to construct a predictive nomogram. Further, we subjected the nomogram’s predictive accuracy to rigorous independent validation. Results The discriminative optimal PAR threshold was determined to be 4.47, effectively stratifying NPC patients into two prognostically distinct subgroups (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28–0.98, P = 0.042). A predictive nomogram was formulated using the results from multivariate analysis, which revealed age greater than 45 years, T stage, N stage, and PAR score as independent predictors of OS. The nomogram demonstrated a commendable predictive capability for OS, with a C-index of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.64–0.75), surpassing the performance of the conventional staging system, which had a C-index of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.65–0.74). Conclusions In the context of NPC patients undergoing CCRT, the novel nutritional-inflammatory biomarker PAR emerges as a promising, cost-efficient, easily accessible, non-invasive, and potentially valuable predictor of prognosis. The predictive efficacy of the nomogram incorporating the PAR score exceeded that of the conventional staging approach, thereby indicating its potential as an enhanced prognostic tool in this clinical setting.

        "abstract": "There is no effective method to predict chemotherapy response and postoperative prognosis of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) patients. Patient‐derived organoid (PDO) has become an important preclinical model. Herein, a living biobank with 50 CRLM organoids derived from primary tumors and paired liver metastatic lesions is successfully constructed. CRLM PDOs from the multiomics levels (histopathology, genome, transcriptome and single‐cell sequencing) are comprehensively analyzed and confirmed that this organoid platform for CRLM could capture intra‐ and interpatient heterogeneity. The chemosensitivity data in vitro reveal the potential value of clinical application for PDOs to predict chemotherapy response (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) and clinical prognosis of CRLM patients. Taken together, CRLM PDOs can be utilized to deliver a potential application for personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "Matrix Gla protein (MGP) was originally reported as a physiological suppressor of ectopia calcification and has also been reported to be associated with cancer. However, the relation between the biological functions of MGP and the immune response in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. Here, we investigated the regulatory role of MGP in the immune microenvironment of CRC. MGP expression in CRC samples was assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and confirmed by quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry analysis of human CRC samples. The effect of MGP on proliferation and invasion of CRC cells was evaluated by in vitro assays involving MGP knockdown and overexpression. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assay were performed to identify transcriptional regulatory sites of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). In vivo experiments were performed in mouse model of CRC liver metastasis established via spleen injection. The results revealed that MGP was significantly upregulated in cancer cell clusters from the primary CRC or liver metastases, compared with that in the corresponding paracancerous tissues via single-cell RNA sequencing. MGP enriched intracellular free Ca2+ levels and promoted NF-κB phosphorylation, thereby activated PD-L1 expression to promote CD8+ T cell exhaustion in CRC. The luciferase reporter assay and ChIP-qPCR assay indicated that the transcriptional regulation of NF-κB upregulated PD-L1 expression. In vivo, MGP inhibition significantly decreased the rate of CRC liver metastasis, which was further reduced after combined therapy with αPD1 (anti-PD1). In conclusions, this study revealed that MGP can facilitate CD8+ T cell exhaustion by activating the NF-κB pathway, leading to liver metastasis of CRC. The combination of MGP knockdown and αPD1 can synergistically resist liver metastasis of CRC.",

Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a secreted, non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein involved in inhibition of tissue calcification. Recently, MGP expression was related to cellular differentiation and tumor progression. A detailed MGP expression analysis in sensitive (A2780) and resistant to paclitaxel (PAC) (A2780PR) and topotecan (TOP) (A2780TR) ovarian cancer cell lines and their corresponding media was performed. MGP mRNA level (real time PCR analysis) and protein expression in cell lysates and cell culture medium (Western blot analysis) and protein expression in cancer cells (immunofluorescence analysis) and cancer patient lesions (immunohistochemistry) were determined in this study. We observed increased expression of MGP in PAC and TOP resistant cell lines at both mRNA and protein level. MGP protein was also detected in the corresponding culture media. Finally, we detected expression of MGP protein in ovarian cancer lesions from different histological type of cancer. MGP is an important factor that might contribute to cancer resistance mechanism by augmenting the interaction of cells with ECM components leading to increased resistance of ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel and topotecan. Expression found in ovarian cancer tissue suggests its possible role in ovarian cancer pathogenesis.",

            "abstract": "With the rapid development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) over the past decades, they have become a major area of interest in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) [1,2]. There are evidence pointing that programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) blockade, alone or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4) therapy, achieved durable responses in patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic CRC (mCRC) [3–6]. However, the optimal diagnostic method for detecting dMMR/MSI-H disease as well as the optimal anti-PD-1-based treatment modality still remains controversial in this patient subset. In addition, for themajority of mCRC cases that are mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) or microsatellite stable (MSS), the clinical benefits from these agents are generally minimal [3,7], driving extensive research efforts to develop effective combination therapies in this disease subset. Moreover, investigations of anti-PD1-based treatments have also been initiated in the nonmetastatic settings of CRC, with some encouraging preliminary evidence [8]. Medical oncologists and surgeons from the Committee of Colorectal Cancer of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology had a panel discussion on immunotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer during a seminar on June 16, 2020, in Guangzhou, China. Herein, the expert opinions have been summarized along with relevant clinical evidence (Table 1) to guide real-world treatment decision-making regarding the use of ICIs in patients with CRC.",

Metastasis is a sequential and dynamic process, but the development of tumor cells during this process is unclear. In this study, we aimed to reveal characteristics of tumor cell subset during CRC metastasis. Methods Single-cell RNA sequence CRC data of normal epithelium, non-metastatic primary tumor, metastatic primary tumor, and liver metastases from gene expression omnibus (GEO) dataset were analyzed to reveal characteristics of CRC metastasis. Primary tumor tissues of three non-metastatic CRC and three metastatic CRC patients from Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College (Wuhan, China) were used to verify the characteristics of CRC metastasis. Results We identified a metastasis-related cancer cell subset EP1, which was characterized with a high expression of KRT17, LAMC2, EMP1, and PLAC8. EP1 had an enhanced cell–cell interaction, which interacted with SPP+ macrophages and drove them toward anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive phenotype. Dynamic changes in genes and TF regulons during the metastasis were also revealed. Conclusions This study advanced our understanding of the development of tumor cells during CRC metastasis and further identified metastasis-related subset and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of CRC metastasis.",

            "abstract": "The H3K4 demethylase KDM5B is amplified and overexpressed in luminal breast cancer, suggesting it might constitute a potential cancer therapy target. Here, we characterize, in breast cancer cells, the molecular effects of a recently developed small-molecule inhibitor of the KDM5 family of proteins (KDM5i), either alone or in combination with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC). KDM5i treatment alone increased expression of a small number of genes, whereas combined treatment with DAC enhanced the effects of the latter for increasing expression of hundreds of DAC-responsive genes. ChIP-seq studies revealed that KDM5i resulted in the broadening of existing H3K4me3 peaks. Furthermore, cells treated with the drug combination exhibited increased promoter and gene body H3K4me3 occupancy at DAC-responsive genes compared with DAC alone. Importantly, treatment with either DAC or DAC+KDM5i induced a dramatic increase in H3K27ac at enhancers with an associated significant increase in target gene expression, suggesting a previously unappreciated effect of DAC on transcriptional regulation. KDM5i synergized with DAC to reduce the viability of luminal breast cancer cells in in vitro assays. Our study provides the first look into the molecular effects of a novel KDM5i compound and suggests that combinatorial inhibition along with DAC represents a new area to explore in translational epigenetics.Significance: This study offers a first look into the molecular effects of a novel KDM5 inhibitory compound, suggesting how its use in combination with DNA methylation inhibitors presents new opportunities to explore in translational cancer epigenetics.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe BRAFV600E mutation is the most common driver in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tumors. In recent years, gene fusions have also been recognized as important drivers of cancer in PTC. Previous studies have suggested that thyroid tumors with fusion genes frequently display an aggressive course. These observations prompted further exploration of gene fusions in PTC tumors. The aim was to search for previously unrecognized gene fusions using thyroid tissue samples from PTC patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nGene fusions were analyzed in RNA sequencing data obtained from 12 PTC tumors and paired unaffected thyroid tissue samples. Candidate fusions were further filtered and validated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. An Ohio cohort of 148 PTC tumor samples was screened for a LMO7-BRAF fusion and the BRAFV600E mutation. Functional assays were performed to assess the LMO7-BRAF fusion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwo coding fusions (CCDC6-RET and LMO7-BRAF) were found in one tumor sample each. The novel LMO7-BRAF fusion was validated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The LMO7-BRAF fusion was a recurrent somatic alteration with a frequency of 2.0% (3/148) in PTC tumors, while the BRAFV600E point mutation was found in 63.5% (94/148) of tumors. Enforced expression of LMO7-BRAF fusion protein stimulated endogenous ERK1/2 phosphorylation and promoted anchorage independent cell growth to an extent similar to BRAFV600E.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA novel fusion gene, LMO7-BRAF, was identified in PTC tumors. The results indicate that the LMO7-BRAF fusion behaves as an oncogenic alteration. This observation expands the spectrum of fusion genes involving kinases in thyroid cancer.",

Six of these had progressively rising CEA titers, and all developed subsequently recurrent cancer; rising CEA levels were observed 0 to 29 months before cancer recurrence was clinically detected. The six with \"stable\" elevations and six with transient elevations developed no clinically detectable cancer. Eighty-four patients with CEA levels consistently under 2.5 ng/ml had no evidence of recurrent neoplasms. Two developed second primaries.

            "abstract": "Macrophages are the most abundant cells within the tumor stroma displaying noticeable plasticity, which allows them to perform several functions within the tumor microenvironment. Tumor‐associated macrophages commonly refer to an alternative M2 phenotype, exhibiting anti‐inflammatory and pro‐tumoral effects. M2 cells are highly versatile and multi‐tasking cells that directly influence multiple steps in tumor development, including cancer cell survival, proliferation, stemness, and invasiveness along with angiogenesis and immunosuppression. M2 cells perform these functions through critical interactions with cells related to tumor progression, including Th2 cells, cancer‐associated fibroblasts, cancer cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and myeloid‐derived suppressor cells. M2 cells also have negative cross‐talks with tumor suppressor cells, including cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells. Programed death‐1 (PD‐1) is one of the key receptors expressed in M2 cells that, upon interaction with its ligand PD‐L1, plays cardinal roles for induction of immune evasion in cancer cells. In addition, M2 cells can neutralize the effects of the pro‐inflammatory and anti‐tumor M1 phenotype. Classically activated M1 cells express high levels of major histocompatibility complex molecules, and the cells are strong killers of cancer cells. Therefore, orchestrating M2 reprogramming toward an M1 phenotype would offer a promising approach for reversing the fate of tumor and promoting cancer regression. Macrophage switching toward an anti‐inflammatory M1 phenotype could be used as an adjuvant with other approaches, including radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockades, such as anti‐PD‐L1/PD‐1 strategies.",

Therapies to prevent disease relapse remain an unmet medical need. Here we uncover the identity and features of the residual tumour cells responsible for CRC relapse. An analysis of single-cell transcriptomes of samples from patients with CRC revealed that the majority of genes associated with a poor prognosis are expressed by a unique tumour cell population that we named high-relapse cells (HRCs). We established a human-like mouse model of microsatellite-stable CRC that undergoes metastatic relapse after surgical resection of the primary tumour. Residual HRCs occult in mouse livers after primary CRC surgery gave rise to multiple cell types over time, including LGR5 + stem-like tumour cells 2 – 4 , and caused overt metastatic disease. Using Emp1 (encoding epithelial membrane protein 1) as a marker gene for HRCs, we tracked and selectively eliminated this cell population. Genetic ablation of EMP1 high cells prevented metastatic recurrence and mice remained disease-free after surgery. We also found that HRC-rich micrometastases were infiltrated with T cells, yet became progressively immune-excluded during outgrowth. Treatment with neoadjuvant immunotherapy eliminated residual metastatic cells and prevented mice from relapsing after surgery. Together, our findings reveal the cell-state dynamics of residual disease in CRC and anticipate that therapies targeting HRCs may help to avoid metastatic relapse. A poor prognosis gene programme in patients with colorectal cancer is expressed by a unique tumour cell population that we name high-relapse cells (HRCs), and ablation of cells expressing the HRC marker EMP1 or neoadjuvant immunotherapy prevented metastatic recurrence in mice.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Background Aquaporin 9 (AQP9) is permeable to water or other small molecules, and plays an important role in various cancers. We previously found that AQP9 was related to the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to identify the role and regulatory mechanism of AQP9 in CRC metastasis. Methods The clinical significance of AQP9 was analysed by using bioinformatics and tissue microarray. Transcriptome sequencing, Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay, Biacore, and co-immunoprecipitation were employed to demonstrate the regulatory mechanism of AQP9 in CRC. The relationship between AQP9 and CRC metastasis was verified in vitro and in vivo by using real-time cell analysis assay, high content screening, and liver metastasis models of nude mice. Results We found that AQP9 was highly expressed in metastatic CRC. AQP9 overexpression reduced cell roundness and enhanced cell motility in CRC. We further showed that AQP9 interacted with Dishevelled 2 (DVL2) via the C-terminal SVIM motif, resulting in DVL2 stabilization and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. Additionally, we identified the E3 ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (NEDD4L) as a modulator regulating the ubiquitination and degradation of AQP9. Conclusions Collectively, our study revealed the important role of AQP9 in regulating DVL2 stabilization and Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote CRC metastasis. Targeting the NEDD4L–AQP9–DVL2 axis might have therapeutic usefulness in metastatic CRC treatment.",

Macrophages accumulate in fibrosis, but the role of specific subgroups in supporting fibrogenesis has not been investigated in vivo. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize the heterogeneity of macrophages in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. A novel computational framework for the annotation of scRNA-seq by reference to bulk transcriptomes (SingleR) enabled the subclustering of macrophages and revealed a disease-associated subgroup with a transitional gene expression profile intermediate between monocyte-derived and alveolar macrophages. These CX3CR1+SiglecF+ transitional macrophages localized to the fibrotic niche and had a profibrotic effect in vivo. Human orthologs of genes expressed by the transitional macrophages were upregulated in samples from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, we have identified a pathological subgroup of transitional macrophages that are required for the fibrotic response to injury. Using scRNA-seq analysis, Bhattacharya and colleagues identify a subset of profibrotic lung macrophages that have a gene expression signature intermediate between those of monocytes and alveolar macrophages.",

        "abstract": "Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. With the increasing incidence of CRC, there is an urgent need for effective strategies for early diagnosis and treatment. Circadian rhythm, a natural biological clock, regulates various physiological processes, and its disruption has been implicated in the onset and progression of cancer. However, the specific roles of circadian rhythm-related genes (CRDGs) in CRC remain unclear. Methods In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of CRDGs in CRC using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and bulk RNA sequencing data from the GSE178318 dataset. We constructed a CRC prognostic model based on CRD scores. Additionally, we explored the potential mechanisms of CRDGs in tumor progression through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and assessed their impact on the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Results The analysis revealed that CRDGs were significantly upregulated in liver metastasis samples compared to primary CRC samples and were closely associated with several metabolic and immune-related pathways. The prognostic model based on CRD scores indicated that higher CRD scores were associated with poorer outcomes in immunotherapy. These findings were further validated in multiple datasets, underscoring the potential of CRDGs as prognostic indicators in CRC. Conclusion This study systematically reveals, for the first time, the expression characteristics of CRDGs in CRC and their relationship with tumor progression and response to immunotherapy. CRDGs may serve as effective prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, offering new strategies for the personalized treatment of CRC.",

Studies have revealed that circadian clock disruption is a control point in cancer progression. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the cancers closely associated with circadian disruption. In the present review, the involvement of the circadian clock in CRC development was summarized. Abnormal expression of certain clock genes has been found in patients with CRC and their correlation with clinicopathological features has also been explored. The period and cryptochrome 2 (Cry2), Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) and neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) genes were reported to have tumour suppressor properties. Conversely, Cry1, brain and muscle ARNT-like-1, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and timeless may aggravate CRC progression, but these findings are not consistent and require to be confirmed by further research. Circadian scheduling also indicated advantages in chemotherapy treatments for patients with CRC by increasing the maximum tolerated doses and decreasing toxicities. Dysfunction of the molecular CLOCK system disrupted cellular processes to accelerate colon tumorigenesis, such as metabolism, cell cycle, DNA damage repair, proliferation and apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness. The clock gene network and how the dynamics of the system influence CRC were discussed.",

        "abstract": "Liver metastasis is the most common site of metastasis in colorectal cancer, and the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis is extremely poor. Revealing the key genes of CLM and implementing targeted interventions is of great significance for colorectal cancer patients. By using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm, key gene modules related to metastasis in colorectal cancer were identified. Subsequently, immune-regulating and prognostic-influencing key gene sets were identified from these modules to construct a prognostic model related to colorectal cancer metastasis. Genetic background differences underlying this model were analyzed using colorectal cancer methylation and mutation data, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis of the relevant biological processes associated with the model. The value of predicting tumor drug response through the model was assessed using drug half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) data from colorectal cancer cell lines. Subsequently, utilizing single-cell sequencing data about liver metastasis, the colorectal cancer immune microenvironment reflected in the predictive model was analyzed, and a key gene set of the model was identified. Lastly, experimental validation was conducted to investigate the regulatory effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) on the key genes of the model, and the cytotoxic effect of PDT on colorectal cancer was confirmed. An immune-related gene prognostic model regulating CLM was constructed, consisting of HSPA1A, ULBP2, RBP7, OXT, SLC11A1, INHBB, and ICOS. This model can predict the clinical response of colorectal cancer patients to Oxaliplatin, Cisplatin, Irinotecan, and 5-Fluorouracil. Single-cell sequencing results demonstrate that the model is associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment in CLM. The higher the model’s riskscore, the weaker the MHC-I, MHC-II, and various tumor immune signaling pathway networks in the colorectal cancer microenvironment. Causal analysis reveals that SLC11A1, ICOS, and HSPA1A play key roles in this model. PDT can kill colorectal cancer cells, inhibit colorectal cancer cell metastasis, significantly influence the expression of genes such as SLC11A1, ICOS, and HSPA1A in these processes, and suppress the infiltration of macrophages in the colorectal microenvironment, inhibiting the immune escape process of PD-1/PD-L1. A prognostic model based on immunity regulated by PDT has been established for assessing the prognosis of CLM patients, as well as clinical responses to chemotherapy drugs and immunotherapy.

            "abstract": "Field cancerization and metastasis are the leading causes for cancer recurrence and mortality in cancer patients. The formation of primary, secondary tumors or metastasis is greatly influenced by multifaceted tumor-stroma interactions, in which stromal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) can affect the behavior of the cancer cells. Many studies have identified cytokines and growth factors as cell signaling molecules that aid cell to cell communication. However, the functional contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a family of volatile chemicals, as communication molecules are less understood. Cancer cells and various tumor-associated stromal cells produce and secrete a copious amount of ROS into the TME. Intracellular ROS modulate cell signaling cascades that aid in the acquisition of several hallmarks of cancers. Extracellular ROS help to propagate, amplify, and effectively create a mutagenic and oncogenic field which facilitate the formation of multifoci tumors and act as a springboard for metastatic tumor cells. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of ROS as atypical paracrine signaling molecules for field cancerization and metastasis. Field cancerization and metastasis are often discussed separately; we offer a model that placed these events with ROS as the focal instigating agent in a broader “seed-soil” hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunologic checkpoint blockade with monoclonal antibodies has achieved recent clinical success in antitumor therapy. However, therapeutic antibodies exhibit several issues such as limited tumor penetration, immunogenicity, and costly production. Here, Bristol-Myers Squibb nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared using a reprecipitation method. The NPs have advantages including passive targeting, hydrophilic and nontoxic features, and a 100% drug loading rate. BMS-202 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction that is developed by BMS. Transfer of BMS-202 NPs to 4T1 tumor-bearing mice results in markedly slower tumor growth to the same degree as treatment with anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (α-PD-L1). Consistently, the combination of Ce6 NPs with BMS-202 NPs or α-PD-L1 in parallel shows more efficacious antitumor and antimetastatic effects, accompanied by enhanced dendritic cell maturation and infiltration of antigen-specific T cells into the tumors. Thus, inhibition rates of primary and distant tumors reach >90%. In addition, BMS-202 NPs are able to attack spreading metastatic lung tumors and offer immune-memory protection to prevent tumor relapse. These results indicate that BMS-202 NPs possess effects similar to α-PD-L1 in the therapies of 4T1 tumors. Therefore, this work reveals the possibility of replacing the antibody used in immunotherapy for tumors with BMS-202 NPs.",

Inducible Co-Stimulator (ICOS), which is expressed on activated T cells, gained interest in the translational medicine community. Areas covered: We performed an extensive literature review using the keywords ‘ICOS’ and ‘cancer’, and the Clinicaltrials.gov database for early phase clinical trials targeting ICOS. In this review, we highlight the dual role of ICOS in oncogenesis in different malignancies. We summarize the current state of knowledge about ICOS/ICOSL pathway targeting by immunotherapies. Expert opinion: Due to its multifaceted link with anti-tumor immunity, both antagonist and agonist antibodies might be of interest to target the ICOS/ICOSL pathway for tumor treatment. Indeed, ICOS activation might potentiate the effect of an inhibitory checkpoint blockade, while its neutralization could decrease the function of immunosuppressive Tregs and inhibit lymphoid tumor cells expressing Tfh markers.",

In clinical practice, some cancer patients experience drug resistance and disease progression in the process of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play key roles in regulating PD-1/PD-L1 immunosuppression by inhibiting the recruitment and function of T cells through cytokines, superficial immune checkpoint ligands, and exosomes. There are several therapies available to recover the anticancer efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors by targeting TAMs, including the inhibition of TAM differentiation and re-education of TAM activation. In this review, we will summarize the roles and mechanisms of TAMs in PD-1/PD-L1 blocker resistance. Furthermore, we will discuss the therapies that were designed to deplete TAMs, re-educate TAMs, and intervene with chemokines secreted by TAMs and exosomes from M1 macrophages, providing more potential options to improve the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Background Chemotherapeutic agents are used to control tumor proliferation. However, their influence in the pre-metastatic niche of target organs has not been well studied. Oxaliplatin (OXA) is a drug applied in standard treatments of colorectal cancer (CRC), while the direct effect of which on the pre-metastatic microenvironment of the liver remains unclear. Methods Models of liver metastases were established with luciferase expressing CT26 cells in BALB/c and BALB/c-nude mice. Single-cell RNA Sequencing was performed to examine the immune microenvironment in the liver elicited by OXA. Immunofluorescence and flowcytometry were utilized to confirm the changes in the number of immune cells. LDH, CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation and apoptosis assays were conducted to explore the impact of OXA on T cells ex vivo. The correlation between chemotherapy-related lymphopenia and metastases was assessed by meta-analysis. Results Herein we discovered that administration of OXA prior to the occurrence of liver metastasis actually accelerated tumor development and colonization in the liver. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the landscape of the liver immune microenvironment had been changed to immunosuppressive phenotype. Macrophages after the treatment of OXA exhibited a high ability to inhibit the activation of T cells. Further investigation revealed a significant decrease in the number of T cells in the liver, particularly CD8^+ T cells with reduced capacity of proliferation, activation, and killing. When mice were treated with T cell supplementation, the OXA-induced metastasis was notably abolished, indicating that the OXA-primed liver microenvironment could be reversed by the infusion of T cells. Consistent with our findings in mice, a meta-analysis was performed to verify that chemotherapy-related lymphopenia was associated with an inferior prognosis related with high incidence of metastasis, suggesting the pivotal role of chemotherapy in pre-metastatic niche formation. Furthermore, a notable reduction in the count of both macrophages and T cells was observed in the liver of colorectal cancer (CRC) patient undergoing OXA-based chemotherapy. Conclusions Our findings proposed that immunosuppressive microenvironment in liver induced by OXA enhanced liver metastasis of colorectal cancer, which highlighted a new consideration to balance the pro metastases and anti-cancer possibility of OXA treatment.",

            "abstract": "The human liver is usually perceived as a non-immunological organ engaged primarily in metabolic, nutrient storage and detoxification activities. However, we now know that the healthy liver is also a site of complex immunological activity mediated by a diverse immune cell repertoire as well as non-hematopoietic cell populations. In the non-diseased liver, metabolic and tissue remodeling functions require elements of inflammation. This inflammation, in combination with regular exposure to dietary and microbial products, creates the potential for excessive immune activation. In this complex microenvironment, the hepatic immune system tolerates harmless molecules while at the same time remaining alert to possible infectious agents, malignant cells or tissue damage. Upon appropriate immune activation to challenge by pathogens or tissue damage, mechanisms to resolve inflammation are essential to maintain liver homeostasis. Failure to clear ‘dangerous’ stimuli or regulate appropriately activated immune mechanisms leads to pathological inflammation and disrupted tissue homeostasis characterized by the progressive development of fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventual liver failure. Hepatic inflammatory mechanisms therefore have a spectrum of roles in the healthy adult liver; they are essential to maintain tissue and organ homeostasis and, when dysregulated, are key drivers of the liver pathology associated with chronic infection, autoimmunity and malignancy. In this review, we explore the changing perception of inflammation and inflammatory mediators in normal liver homeostasis and propose targeting of liver-specific immune regulation pathways as a therapeutic approach to treat liver disease.",

Although 5 year survival rate for patients at the early stage of CRC (stages I and II) is above 60%, more than 50% of patients are diagnosed at or beyond stage III when distant metastasis has already occurred, in which case 5 year survival rate drops to 10%. Chemotherapeutic intervention coupled with surgery is the backbone of metastatic CRC treatment and the only means of enhanced survival. For decades following its discovery, an antimetabolite 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) was the only chemotherapeutic agent available to successfully improve 12 month survival in CRC patients. Treatment of metastatic CRC has been considered palliative for many years; aiming to increase the duration and quality of the patient's remaining life, with little hope of cure, highlighting the need for novel DNA and RNA targeted therapies in the treatment of CRC. Over the last several decades, combinations of several chemotherapeutic agents have been incorporated into routine clinical practice. Combination regimes incorporating irinotecan, a semisynthetic inhibitor of topoisomerase, oxaliplatin, a third-generation platinum compound that causes mitotic arrest via the formation of DNA adducts, and capecitabine, a 5-FU prodrug, are now all established options for use as first-line, second-line and sequential treatment of CRC.

RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of negative immunoregulatory molecules expressed by DCs may provide a strategy to enhance the potency of DC-based vaccines and immunotherapy. Ablation of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) in antigen-presenting cells has been shown to enhance cellular immune response in mice. Here, we used a previously reported DC-targeting approach to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SOCS-1 to human myeloid-derived DCs (MDDCs). SOCS1-silencing in MDDCs resulted in enhanced cytokine responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a strong mixed-lymphocyte reaction. Moreover, only DCs treated with SOCS-1 siRNA, and not controls, elicited strong primary in vitro responses to well-characterized HLA-A*0201-restricted Melan-A/MART-1 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Gag epitopes in naive CD8(+) T cells from healthy donors. Finally, stimulation of CD8(+) T cells from HIV-seropositive subjects with SOCS1-silenced DCs resulted in an augmented polyfunctional cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, suggesting that SOCS-1 silencing can restore functionally compromised T cells in HIV infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate the feasibility of DC3-9dR-mediated manipulation of DC function to enhance DC immunogenicity for potential vaccine or immunotherapeutic applications.",

In addition, oxidative stress is an important pathophysiological mechanism of OXA-induced liver injury. Therefore, dietary antioxidants may decrease or prevent hepatic toxicity in vivo and be beneficial to OXA-based chemotherapy. Methods An experimental OXA-induced liver injury animal model was established, and the protective effects of curcumin (CUR) against OXA-induced liver injury were investigated. ELISA was used to determine the levels of MDA, SOD, CAT, and GSH in liver tissue. The effect of CUR treatment on the expression of cytokines and the Nrf2 pathway was determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Results CUR treatment alleviated OXA-induced hepatic pathological damage and splenomegaly. The protective effect of CUR was demonstrated to be correlated with inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and the coagulation system. Furthermore, Western blotting revealed that CUR treatment reverses the suppression of Nrf2 nuclear translocation and increases the expression of HO-1 and NOQ1 in mice with OXA-induced liver injury. Moreover, the Nrf2 activation and hepatoprotective effect of CUR were abolished by brusatol. Conclusion Curcumin attenuates oxaliplatin-induced liver injury and oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2 pathway, which suggests that CUR may be potentially used in the prevention and treatment of OXA-induced liver injury.",

We evaluated TRL and its association with survival in anal cancer patients treated with chemoradiation (CRT).\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA retrospective analysis of 140 patients with non-metastatic anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with definitive CRT was performed. Total lymphocyte counts (TLC) at baseline and monthly intervals up to 12 months after initiating CRT were analyzed. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between overall survival (OS) and TRL, dichotomized by G4 TRL (<0.2k/μl) two months after initiating CRT. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to compare OS between patients with versus without G4 TRL.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMedian time of follow-up was 55 months. Prior to CRT, 95% of patients had a normal TLC (>1k/μl). Two months after initiating CRT, there was a median of 71% reduction in TLC from baseline and 84% of patients had TRL: 11% G1, 31% G2, 34% G3, and 8% G4. On multivariable Cox model, G4 TRL at two months was associated with a 3.7-fold increased risk of death. On log-rank test, the 5-year OS rate was 32% in the cohort with G4 TRL versus 86% in the cohort without G4 TRL.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTRL is common and may be another prognostic marker of OS in anal cancer patients treated with CRT. The association between TRL and OS suggests an important role of the host immunity in anal cancer outcomes.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE\nAmong patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma, this is the first detailed report demonstrating that standard chemoradiation (CRT) commonly results in treatment-related lymphopenia (TRL) which may be associated with a poorer overall survival (OS). The association between TRL and worse OS observed in this study supports the importance of host immunity in survival among patients with anal cancer. Our findings encourage larger, prospective studies to further investigate TRL, its predictors, and its relationship with survival outcomes. Furthermore, our study supports ongoing efforts of clinical trials to investigate the potential role of immunotherapy in anal cancer.",

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2‐fold to 3‐fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2‐fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.",

Here, we report that osteosarcoma Rab22a-NeoF1 fusion protein, together with its binding partner PYK2, is sorted into exosomes by HSP90 via its KFERQ-like motif (RVLFLN 142 ). The exosomal Rab22a-NeoF1 fusion protein facilitates the pulmonary pre-metastatic niche formation by recruiting bone marrow-derived macrophages. The exosomal PYK2 activates RhoA in its negative recipient osteosarcoma cells and induces signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation in its recipient macrophages to increase M2 phenotype. Consequently, lung metastases of its recipient osteosarcoma cells are promoted by this exosomal Rab22a-NeoF1 fusion protein, and this event can be targeted by disrupting its interaction with PYK2 using a designed internalizing RGD peptide.",

            "abstract": "Our study investigated the association between treatment-related lymphopenia and overall survival (OS) in a series of glioblastoma (GBM) patients. We also explored clinical and dosimetric predictors of lymphocytes depletion. Between 2015 and 2019, 64 patients were treated at the same institution with postoperative chemoradiotherapy. Peripheral lymphocyte count (PLC) data and dose–volume histogram parameters were collected. Radiotherapy (RT) schedule consisted in standard total dose of 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions, with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). Posttreatment acute absolute lymphopenia (nadir AAL) was calculated as a PLC lower than 1.0 × 103/mm3. Acute relative lymphopenia (ARL) was expressed by the nadir-PLC/baseline-PLC ratio < 0.5. Nadir-PLC was the lowest PLC registered between the end of RT and the first month of follow-up. Survival rates were estimated with Kaplan–Meier curves. Clinical and dosimetric variables related to AAL/ARL and OS were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 57 patients were eligible and included in the analyses. The median PLC was significantly decreased following chemoradiotherapy (2180/mm3 vs 900/mm3). Median OS was 16 months (range 5–55 months), with no significant difference between patients who developed nadir AAL and those who did not (16 months vs 16.5 months; p = 0.304). When considering ARL vs non-ARL, median OS was 14 months vs 26 months (p = 0.013), respectively. In multivariate Cox regression only age, sex, extent of surgery, access to adjuvant chemotherapy and brain D98% were independently associated with OS. Although iatrogenic immunosuppression could be associated with inferior clinical outcomes, our data show that treatment-related lymphopenia does not adversely affect GBM survival. Prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.",

        "abstract": "Background Liver metastasis (LM) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in CRC patients, whereas the associated mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, it is urgently needed to deeply explore novel metastasis accelerators and therapeutic targets of LM-CRC. Methods The bulk RNA sequencing data and clinicopathological information of CRC patients were enrolled from the TCGA and GEO databases. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets of CRC were collected from and analyzed in the Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) database. The infiltration levels of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and macrophages in CRC tissues were estimated by multiple immune deconvolution algorithms. The prognostic values of genes were identified by the Kaplan-Meier curve with a log-rank test. GSEA analysis was carried out to annotate the significantly enriched gene sets. The biological functions of cells were experimentally verified. Results In the present study, hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected in LM-CRC compared to primary CRC, and these DEGs were significantly associated with the regulation of endopeptidase activity, blood coagulation, and metabolic processes. Then, SPP1, CAV1, ANGPTL2, and COLEC11 were identified as the characteristic DEGs of LM-CRC, and higher expression levels of SPP1 and ANGPTL2 were significantly associated with worse clinical outcomes of CRC patients. In addition, ANGPTL2 and SPP1 mainly distributed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of CRC tissues. Subsequent scRNA-seq analysis demonstrated that ANGPTL2 and SPP1 were markedly enriched in the CAFs and macrophages of CRC tissues, respectively. Moreover, we identified the significantly enriched gene sets in LM-CRC, especially those in the SPP1+macrophages and ANGPTL2+CAFs, such as the HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION and the HALLMARK_COMPLEMENT. Finally, our in vitro experiments proved that ANGPTL2+CAFs and SPP1+macrophages promote the metastasis of CRC cells. Conclusion Our study selected four characteristic genes of LM-CRC and identified ANGPTL2+CAFs and SPP1+macrophages subtypes as metastasis accelerators of CRC which provided a potential therapeutic target for LM-CRC.",

            "abstract": "Background Although downregulation of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), which is a key constituent of membrane caveolae and a regulator of cellular processes, is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), its involvement in the disease progression is largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the role of Cav-1 in CRC and the associated mechanisms. Material/Methods Fresh tissues from patients with CRC and human CRC SW480 cells were used to evaluate Cav-1 and Ki-67 expression using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The MTS and Transwell assays were performed to determine the effects of Cav-1 overexpression via pcDNA3.1/Cav-1 plasmid on cell proliferation and metastasis. The effect of Cav-1 on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation was evaluated by Western blotting. The correlation of Cav-1 expression with clinicopathological factors was statistically analyzed. Results Overexpression of Cav-1 significantly reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion of SW480 cancer cells in vitro. The EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and activations of the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways were adversely regulated by Cav-1 overexpression in vitro. In 76 cases of CRC patients with EGFR expression, a negative correlation was observed between the level of Cav-1 and tumor-node-metastasis stage, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis (All p<0.05). Finally, the expression level of Cav-1 was negatively correlated with that of Ki-67. Conclusions This report is the first to show that overexpression of Cav-1significantly inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion potential of SW480 cells, possibly through reducing EGF-induced EGFR activation. High Cav-1 expression level may be a predictor of positive outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer.",

            "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT), besides cancer cells, also affects the tumor microenvironment (TME): tumor blood vessels and cells of the immune system. It damages endothelial cells and causes radiation-induced inflammation. Damaged vessels inhibit the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes into tumors, and immunosuppressive pathways are activated. They lead to the accumulation of radioresistant suppressor cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with the M2 phenotype, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The area of tumor hypoxia increases. Hypoxia reduces oxygen-dependent DNA damage and weakens the anti-cancer RT effect. It activates the formation of new blood vessels and leads to cancer relapse after irradiation. Irradiation may also activate the immune response through immunogenic cell death induction. This leads to the “in situ” vaccination effect. In this article, we review how changes in the TME affect radiation-induced anticancer efficacy. There is a very delicate balance between the activation of the immune system and the immunosuppression induced by RT. The effects of RT doses on immune system reactions and also on tumor vascularization remain unclear. A better understanding of these interactions will contribute to the optimization of RT treatment, which may prevent the recurrence of cancer.",

            "abstract": "Cancer development and progression occurs in concert with alterations in the surrounding stroma. Cancer cells can functionally sculpt their microenvironment through the secretion of various cytokines, chemokines, and other factors. This results in a reprogramming of the surrounding cells, enabling them to play a determinative role in tumor survival and progression. Immune cells are important constituents of the tumor stroma and critically take part in this process. Growing evidence suggests that the innate immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and natural killer cells) as well as adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells) contribute to tumor progression when present in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cross-talk between cancer cells and the proximal immune cells ultimately results in an environment that fosters tumor growth and metastasis. Understanding the nature of this dialog will allow for improved therapeutics that simultaneously target multiple components of the TME, increasing the likelihood of favorable patient outcomes.",

            "abstract": "Macrophages are a diverse set of cells present in all body compartments. This diversity is imprinted by their ontogenetic origin (embryonal versus adult bone marrow-derived cells); the organ context; the activation or deactivation of various signals in the contexts of microbial invasion, tissue damage, and metabolic derangement; and by polarization of adaptive T cell responses. Classic adaptive responses of macrophages include tolerance, priming, and a wide spectrum of activation states, including M1, M2, or M2-like. Moreover, macrophages can retain long-term imprinting of microbial encounters (trained innate immunity). Single-cell analysis of mononuclear phagocytes in health and disease has added a new dimension to our understanding of the diversity of macrophage differentiation and activation. Epigenetic landscapes, transcription factors, and microRNA networks underlie the adaptability of macrophages to different environmental cues. Macrophage plasticity, an essential component of chronic inflammation, and its involvement in diverse human diseases, most notably cancer, is discussed here as a paradigm.

        "abstract": "Inflammation is a common medical complication in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, which plays significant roles in tumor progression and immunosuppression. However, the influence of inflammatory conditions on the tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is incompletely understood. Here we show that in a patient with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) CRC and a local inflammatory condition, the primary tumor progresses but its liver metastasis regresses upon Pembrolizumab treatment. In silico investigation prompted by this observation confirms correlation between inflammatory conditions and poor tumor response to PD-1 blockade in MSI-H CRCs, which is further validated in a cohort of 62 patients retrospectively enrolled to our study. Inhibition of local but not systemic immune response is verified in cultures of paired T cells and organoid cells from patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing suggests involvement of neutrophil leukocytes via CD80/CD86-CTLA4 signaling in the suppressive immune microenvironment. In concordance with this finding, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio indicates inhibited immune status and poor tumor response to ICIs. Receiver operating characteristic curve further demonstrates that both inflammatory conditions and a high NLR could predict a poor response to ICIs in MSI- CRCs, and the predictive value could be further increased when these two predictors are combined. Our study thus suggests that inflammatory conditions in MSI-H CRCs correlate with resistance to ICIs through neutrophil leukocyte associated immunosuppression and proposes both inflammatory conditions and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as clinical features for poor ICI response. Inflammatory conditions often affect colorectal cancer patients, and their effect on their ongoing treatment is a pressing medical question. Here authors show that inflammation interferes with local anti-tumour immune response and inhibits response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy via immunosuppressive neutrophil leukocytes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Neutrophils are a highly heterogeneous cellular population. However, a thorough examination of the different transcriptional neutrophil states between health and malignancy has not been performed. We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing of human and murine datasets, both publicly available and independently generated, to identify neutrophil transcriptomic subtypes and developmental lineages in health and malignancy. Datasets of lung, breast, and colorectal cancer were integrated to establish and validate neutrophil gene signatures. Pseudotime analysis was used to identify genes driving neutrophil development from health to cancer. Finally, ligand–receptor interactions and signaling pathways between neutrophils and other immune cell populations in primary colorectal cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer were investigated. We define two main neutrophil subtypes in primary tumors: an activated subtype sharing the transcriptomic signatures of healthy neutrophils; and a tumor-specific subtype. This signature is conserved in murine and human cancer, across different tumor types. In colorectal cancer metastases, neutrophils are more heterogeneous, exhibiting additional transcriptomic subtypes. Pseudotime analysis implicates IL1β/CXCL8/CXCR2 axis in the progression of neutrophils from health to cancer and metastasis, with effects on T-cell effector function. We propose that the emergence of metastatic-specific neutrophil subtypes is driven by the IL1β/CXCL8/CXCR2 axis, with the evolution of different transcriptomic signals that impair T-cell function at the metastatic site. Thus, a better understanding of neutrophil transcriptomic programming could optimize immunotherapeutic interventions into early and late interventions, targeting different neutrophil states. Significance: We identify two recurring neutrophil populations and demonstrate their staged evolution from health to malignancy through the IL1β/CXCL8/CXCR2 axis, allowing for immunotherapeutic neutrophil-targeting approaches to counteract immunosuppressive subtypes that emerge in metastasis.",

We have developed a novel technique of dual adoptive transfer, which allowed us to precisely compare, in normal mice, the in vivo antiviral responses of two T cell populations that differ only in their expression of the IFNγ receptor. We use this technique to show that, contrary to expectations, IFNγ strongly stimulates the development of CD8+ T cell responses during an acute viral infection. The stimulatory effect is abrogated in T cells lacking the IFNγ receptor, indicating that the cytokine acts directly upon CD8+ T cells to increase their abundance during acute viral infection.",

Despite the improvement of the surgical techniques and chemotherapy, we have not completely overcome this disease yet due to the metastases. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms through which metastasis occurs is important for overcoming CRC. Normal host cells in the tumor microenvironment, such as macrophages and fibroblasts, have been reported to promote the growth of CRCs. Although neutrophils were originally considered to have defensive functions against tumor cells, it has been revealed that some populations of neutrophils, called as tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), have tumor-supportive functions. The plasticity between tumor-suppressive and -supportive neutrophils are regulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and Interferon-β signaling. Some studies have demonstrated that TANs promote the spread of cancer cells to distant organs. TANs contribute to the tumor invasion and angiogenesis through the production of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the primary and metastatic sites. Neutrophils also promotes tumor cell dissemination by capturing circulating tumor cells using neutrophil extracellular traps and promote their migration to distant sites. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a well-defined predictive marker for CRC patients. In this review, we highlight the molecular signaling between TANs and CRC cells and the possibility of TANs as a potential target for cancer therapy.",

Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D) can result in severe inflammatory complications. As neutrophils are essential to normal and aberrant inflammation, we conducted RNA-seq transcriptomic analyses to investigate the association between neutrophil gene expression and T2D phenotype. As specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) act to resolve inflammation, we further surveyed the impact of neutrophil receptor binding SPM resolvin E1 (RvE1) on isolated diabetic and healthy neutrophils. Cell isolation and RNA-seq analysis of neutrophils from N = 11 T2D and N = 7 healthy individuals with available clinical data was conducted. Additionally, cultured neutrophils (N = 3 T2D, N = 3 healthy) were perturbed with increasing RvE1 doses (0 nM, 1 nM, 10 nM, or 100 nM) prior to RNA-seq. Data was evaluated through a bioinformatics pipeline including pathway analysis and post hoc false discovery rate (FDR)-correction. We observed significant differential expression of 50 genes between T2D and healthy neutrophils (p < 0.05), including decreased T2D gene expression in inflammatory- and lipid-related genes SLC9A4, NECTIN2, and PLPP3 (p < 0.003). RvE1 treatment induced dose-dependent differential gene expression (uncorrected p < 0.05) across groups, including 59 healthy and 216 T2D neutrophil genes. Comparing T2D to healthy neutrophils, 1097 genes were differentially expressed across RvE1 doses, including two significant genes, LILRB5 and AKR1C1, involved in inflammation (p < 0.05). The neutrophil transcriptomic database revealed novel chronic inflammatory- and lipid-related genes that were differentially expressed between T2D cells when compared to controls, and cells responded to RvE1 dose-dependently by gene expression changes. Unraveling the mechanisms regulating abnormalities in diabetic neutrophil responses could lead to better diagnostics and therapeutics targeting inflammation and inflammation resolution.",

Although traditionally considered in context of their antimicrobial effector functions, the importance of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) in the development of cancer has become increasingly clear during the last decade. With regard to their high plasticity, neutrophils were shown to acquire an anti-tumorigenic N1 or a pro-tumorigenic N2 phenotype. Despite the urgent need to get a comprehensive understanding of the interaction of TANs with their tumor microenvironment, most studies still rely on murine tumor models. Here we present for the first time a polarization attempt to generate N1 and N2 neutrophils from primary human neutrophils in vitro. Our results underscore that N1-polarized neutrophils have a pro-inflammatory phenotype characterized among others by a higher level of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and high secretion of interferon (IFN)γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10)/C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Further, we demonstrate that neutrophils incubated under a tumor-mimicking in vitro environment show a high cell surface expression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) and secrete high levels of interleukin (IL)-8. These findings suggest that it is feasible to polarize blood-derived primary human neutrophils toward N1- and N2-like phenotypes in vitro. Further, we hypothesized that the presence of anti-inflammatory neutrophil phenotype is not a phenomenon limited to cancer but also occurs when neutrophils are infected with intracellular pathogens. Indeed, our findings indicate that N2-polarized neutrophils exert a markedly decreased capacity to kill the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani and therefore permit parasite persistence.",

However, Tregs are also essential for the maintenance of the immune tolerance of the body and share many molecular signalling pathways with conventional T cells, including cytotoxic T cells, the primary mediators of tumour immunity. Hence, the inability to specifically target and neutralize Tregs in the tumour microenvironment without globally compromising self-tolerance poses a significant challenge. Here, we review recent advances in characterizing tumour-infiltrating Tregs with a focus on the functional roles of costimulatory and inhibitory receptors in Tregs, evaluate their potential as clinical targets, and systematically summarize their roles in potential treatment strategies. Also, we propose modalities to integrate our increasing knowledge on Tregs phenotype and function for the rational design of checkpoint inhibitor-based combination therapies. Finally, we propose possible treatment strategies that can be used to develop Treg-targeted therapies.",

Both deficiency and overactivation of Treg cell function can result in disease pathology. While loss of Treg function can lead to autoimmunity, an overabundance of Treg activity can promote tumorigenesis. Blocking and/or depleting Tregs has emerged as a viable strategy to enhance antitumor immunity. A major limitation underlying the limited efficacy observed with Treg therapies in the clinic is lack of selective targeting, often attributed to concurrent depletion of antitumor effector T‐cell populations. Novel approaches to improve the specificity of Treg targeting in the context of cancer include the use of T‐cell receptor mimic antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and near‐infrared photoimmunotherapy. Next‐generation technology platforms and transcriptomic/computational‐based screening methods have been recently developed to identify preferential Treg targets. Herein, we highlight key advancements and challenges pertaining to the development of novel Treg targeting cancer therapeutics and discuss ongoing clinical trials evaluating next‐generation Treg therapies for solid tumors.",

            "abstract": "It has long been recognized that cigarette smoking is a shared risk factor for lung cancer and the debilitating lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As the severity of COPD increases, so does the risk for developing lung cancer, independently of pack years smoked. Neutrophilic inflammation increases with COPD severity and anti-inflammatories such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can modulate neutrophil function and cancer risk. This review discusses the biology of tumour associated neutrophils (TANs) in lung cancer, which increase in density with tumour progression, particularly in smokers with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is now increasingly recognized that neutrophils are responsive to the tumour microenvironment (TME) and polarize into distinct phenotypes that operate in an anti- (N1) or pro-tumorigenic (N2) manner. Intriguingly, the emergence of the pro-tumorigenic N2 phenotype increases with tumour growth, to suggest that cancer cells and the surrounding stroma can re-educate neutrophils. The neutrophil itself is a potent source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), arginase, proteases and cytokines that paradoxically can exert a potent immunosuppressive effect on lymphocytes including cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Indeed, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a systemic biomarker that is elevated in lung cancer patients and prognostic for poor survival outcomes. Herein, we review the molecular mechanisms by which neutrophil derived mediators can suppress CTL function. Selective therapeutic strategies designed to suppress pathogenic neutrophils in NSCLC may cooperate with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) to increase CTL killing of cancer cells in the TME.",

Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) is a commonly mutated oncogene in CRC, with mutations in approximately 40% of all CRC cases; its mutations result in constitutive activation of the KRAS protein, which acts as a molecular switch to persistently stimulate downstream signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and survival, thereby leading to tumorigenesis. Patients whose CRC harbors KRAS mutations have a dismal prognosis. Currently, KRAS mutation testing is a routine clinical practice before treating metastatic cases, and the approaches developed to detect KRAS mutations have exhibited favorable sensitivity and accuracy. Due to the presence of KRAS mutations, this group of CRC patients requires more precise therapies. However, KRAS was historically thought to be an undruggable target until the development of KRASG12C allele-specific inhibitors. These promising inhibitors may provide novel strategies to treat KRAS-mutant CRC. Here, we provide an overview of the role of KRAS in the prognosis, diagnosis and treatment of CRC.",

HCC immunotherapy offers great promise; however, recent data suggests NASH-HCC may be less sensitive to conventional immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). We hypothesised that targeting neutrophils using a CXCR2 small molecule inhibitor may sensitise NASH-HCC to ICI therapy. Design Neutrophil infiltration was characterised in human HCC and mouse models of HCC. Late-stage intervention with anti-PD1 and/or a CXCR2 inhibitor was performed in murine models of NASH-HCC. The tumour immune microenvironment was characterised by imaging mass cytometry, RNA-seq and flow cytometry. Results Neutrophils expressing CXCR2, a receptor crucial to neutrophil recruitment in acute-injury, are highly represented in human NASH-HCC. In models of NASH-HCC lacking response to ICI, the combination of a CXCR2 antagonist with anti-PD1 suppressed tumour burden and extended survival. Combination therapy increased intratumoural XCR1+ dendritic cell activation and CD8+ T cell numbers which are associated with anti-tumoural immunity, this was confirmed by loss of therapeutic effect on genetic impairment of myeloid cell recruitment, neutralisation of the XCR1-ligand XCL1 or depletion of CD8+ T cells. Therapeutic benefit was accompanied by an unexpected increase in tumour-associated neutrophils (TANs) which switched from a protumour to anti-tumour progenitor-like neutrophil phenotype. Reprogrammed TANs were found in direct contact with CD8+ T cells in clusters that were enriched for the cytotoxic anti-tumoural protease granzyme B. Neutrophil reprogramming was not observed in the circulation indicative of the combination therapy selectively influencing TANs. Conclusion CXCR2-inhibition induces reprogramming of the tumour immune microenvironment that promotes ICI in NASH-HCC.",

Growing tumors stimulate angiogenesis, providing them with nutrients and oxygen. Ultimately, tumor cells invade the surrounding tissue and metastasize; a process responsible for about 90% of cancer-related deaths. Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) modulate the cellular processes closely related to tumor cell biology, such as adhesion and detachment, migration, polarity, and guidance. Soon after first being described, individual human aGPCRs were found to be involved in tumorigenesis. Twenty-five years ago, CD97/ADGRE5 was discovered to be induced in one of the most severe tumors, dedifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. After decades of research, the time has come to review our knowledge of the presence and function of CD97 in cancer. In summary, CD97 is obviously induced or altered in many tumor entities; this has been shown consistently in nearly one hundred published studies. However, its high expression at circulating and tumor-infiltrating immune cells renders the systemic targeting of CD97 in tumors difficult.",

Here, we show that the C-type lectin receptor CLEC-1 expressed by myeloid cells senses dead cells killed by programmed necrosis. Moreover, we identified Tripartite Motif Containing 21 (TRIM21) as an endogenous ligand overexpressed in various cancers. We observed that the combination of CLEC-1 blockade with chemotherapy prolonged mouse survival in tumor models. Loss of CLEC-1 reduced the accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in tumors and invigorated the activation state of dendritic cells (DCs), thereby increasing T cell responses. Mechanistically, we found that the absence of CLEC-1 increased the cross-presentation of dead cell–associated antigens by conventional type-1 DCs. We identified antihuman CLEC-1 antagonist antibodies able to enhance antitumor immunity in CLEC-1 humanized mice. Together, our results demonstrate that CLEC-1 acts as an immune checkpoint in myeloid cells and support CLEC-1 as a novel target for cancer immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Serine metabolism plays a pivotal role in cancer progression by supporting essential biosynthetic pathways and energy production. Exploring the intricacies of serine metabolism in cancer may uncover novel therapeutic opportunities. This study presents a comprehensive pan‐cancer analysis of serine metabolism‐related genes (SMGs), with a particular emphasis on colorectal cancer (CRC), to elucidate their expression patterns, genetic alterations and clinical significance. We performed a pan‐cancer analysis of SMGs using integrating transcriptomic, genomic and epigenetic data from TCGA and GTEx databases. For CRC, we performed in‐depth analyses comparing expression patterns between tumour and normal tissues, examining prognostic significance and exploring associations with the tumour microenvironment (TME). The distribution patterns of SMGs within the TME were further investigated using single‐cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Key SMGs, including PHGDH, SLC1A5 and SLC38A2, were validated in two independent real‐world cohorts of CRC. Pan‐cancer analysis revealed that SMGs are differentially expressed across tumour types, with their dysregulation associated with copy number alterations and epigenetic modifications. In CRC, aberrant SMG expression is significantly associated with clinical outcomes, key signalling pathways and the TME. Notably, PHGDH was consistently upregulated in CRC and associated with poor prognosis, while SLC1A5 emerged as a potential biomarker for liver metastasis. This study underscores the importance of SMGs, particularly PHGDH, SLC1A5 and SLC38A2, in CRC progression and prognosis. Our findings offer valuable insights into SMGs as a potential therapeutic target and provide a foundation for developing personalised metabolic interventions in CRC.",

System L is an AA exchanger, proposed to accumulate certain AAs by coupling to dissipation of concentration gradient(s) of exchange substrates generated by secondary active AA transporters such as System A (SNAT2). We addressed the hypothesis that this type of coupling (termed tertiary active transport) acts as an indirect mechanism to extend the range of AA stimulating TOR to those transported by both Systems A and L (e.g., Gln) through downstream enhancement of Leu accumulation. System A overexpression enabled Xenopus oocytes to accumulate substrate AAs (notably Ser, Gln, Ala, Pro, Met; totaling 2.6 nmol/oocyte) from medium containing a physiological AA mixture at plasma concentrations. Net accumulation of System L (4F2hc-xLAT1) substrates from this medium by System L-overexpressing oocytes was increased by 90% (from 0.7 to 1.35 nmol/oocyte; mainly Leu, Ile) when Systems A and L were coexpressed, coincident with a decline in accumulation of specific System A substrates (Gln, Ser, Met), as expected if the latter were also System L substrates and functional coupling of the transport Systems occurred. AA flux coupling was confirmed as trans-stimulation of Leu influx in System L-expressing oocytes by Gln injection (0.5 nmol/oocyte). The observed changes in Leu accumulation are sufficient to activate the TOR pathway in oocytes, although intracellular AA metabolism limits the potential for AA accumulation by tertiary active transport in this system.",

ESTIMATE scores correlate with DNA copy number-based tumour purity across samples from 11 different tumour types, profiled on Agilent, Affymetrix platforms or based on RNA sequencing and available through The Cancer Genome Atlas. The prediction accuracy is further corroborated using 3,809 transcriptional profiles available elsewhere in the public domain. The ESTIMATE method allows consideration of tumour-associated normal cells in genomic and transcriptomic studies. An R-library is available on https://sourceforge.net/projects/estimateproject/. Tumour biopsies contain contaminating normal cells and these can influence the analysis of tumour samples. In this study, Yoshihara et al.develop an algorithm based on gene expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas to estimate the number of contaminating normal cells in tumour samples.",

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

TLOs differ structurally from canonical secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), in that they lack a mantle zone and are not encapsulated, suggesting that they may provide unique immune function. A notable feature of TLOs is the frequent presence of structures typical of germinal centers (GCs). However, little is known about the role of such GCs, and in particular, it is not clear if the B cell response within is autonomous, or whether it synergizes with concurrent responses in SLOs. This review will discuss ectopic lymphoneogenesis and the role of the B cell in TLO formation and subsequent effector output in the context of autoimmunity and transplantation, with particular focus on the contribution of ectopic GCs to affinity maturation in humoral immune responses and to the potential breakdown of self-tolerance and development of humoral autoimmunity.",

            "abstract": "Cancer cells adapt their metabolic processes to drive macromolecular biosynthesis for rapid cell growth and proliferation. RNA interference (RNAi)-based loss-of-function screening has proven powerful for the identification of new and interesting cancer targets, and recent studies have used this technology in vivo to identify novel tumour suppressor genes. Here we developed a method for identifying novel cancer targets via negative-selection RNAi screening using a human breast cancer xenograft model at an orthotopic site in the mouse. Using this method, we screened a set of metabolic genes associated with aggressive breast cancer and stemness to identify those required for in vivo tumorigenesis. Among the genes identified, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is in a genomic region of recurrent copy number gain in breast cancer and PHGDH protein levels are elevated in 70% of oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers. PHGDH catalyses the first step in the serine biosynthesis pathway, and breast cancer cells with high PHGDH expression have increased serine synthesis flux. Suppression of PHGDH in cell lines with elevated PHGDH expression, but not in those without, causes a strong decrease in cell proliferation and a reduction in serine synthesis. We find that PHGDH suppression does not affect intracellular serine levels, but causes a drop in the levels of α-ketoglutarate, another output of the pathway and a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. In cells with high PHGDH expression, the serine synthesis pathway contributes approximately 50% of the total anaplerotic flux of glutamine into the TCA cycle. These results reveal that certain breast cancers are dependent upon increased serine pathway flux caused by PHGDH overexpression and demonstrate the utility of in vivo negative-selection RNAi screens for finding potential anticancer targets.",

However, previous studies have reported that a gene-independent antiproliferative effect of Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage confounds such measurement of genetic dependency, thereby leading to false-positive results in copy number–amplified regions. We developed CERES, a computational method to estimate gene-dependency levels from CRISPR–Cas9 essentiality screens while accounting for the copy number–specific effect. In our efforts to define a cancer dependency map, we performed genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9 essentiality screens across 342 cancer cell lines and applied CERES to this data set. We found that CERES decreased false-positive results and estimated sgRNA activity for both this data set and previously published screens performed with different sgRNA libraries. We further demonstrate the utility of this collection of screens, after CERES correction, for identifying cancer-type-specific vulnerabilities.",

            "abstract": "In solid tumors, the presence of lymph node-like structures called tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) is associated with improved patient survival. However, little is known about how TLS develop in cancer, how their function affects survival, and whether they are affected by cancer therapy. In this study, we used multispectral microscopy, quantitative pathology, and gene expression profiling to analyze TLS formation in human lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and in an experimental model of lung TLS induction. We identified a niche of CXCL13+ perivascular and CXCL12+LTB+ and PD-L1+ epithelial cells supporting TLS formation. We also characterized sequential stages of TLS maturation in LSCC culminating in the formation of germinal centers (GC). In untreated patients, TLS density was the strongest independent prognostic marker. Furthermore, TLS density correlated with GC formation and expression of adaptive immune response-related genes. In patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, TLS density was similar, but GC formation was impaired and the prognostic value of TLS density was lost. Corticosteroids are coadministered with chemotherapy to manage side effects in LSCC patients, so we evaluated whether they impaired TLS development independently of chemotherapy. TLS density and GC formation were each reduced in chemotherapy-naïve LSCC patients treated with corticosteroids before surgery, compared with untreated patients, a finding that we confirmed in the experimental model of lung TLS induction. Overall, our results highlight the importance of GC formation in TLS during tumor development and treatment.Significance: Corticosteroid treatment during chemotherapy negatively affects the development of tertiary lymphoid structures and abrogates their prognostic value in patients with lung cancer.

            "abstract": "Abstract Background FIRE-3 compared first-line therapy with FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab in 592 KRAS exon 2 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. The consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) are grouping CRC samples according to their gene-signature in four different subtypes. Relevance of CMS for the treatment of mCRC has yet to be defined. Patients and Methods In this exploratory analysis, patients were grouped according to the previously published tumor CRC-CMSs. Objective response rates (ORR) were compared using chi-square test. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) times were compared using Kaplan–Meier estimation, log-rank tests. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated according to the Cox proportional hazard method. Results CMS classification could be determined in 438 out of 514 specimens available from the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (n = 592). Frequencies for the remaining 438 samples were as follows: CMS1 (14%), CMS2 (37%), CMS3 (15%), CMS4 (34%). For the 315 RAS wild-type tumors, frequencies were as follows: CMS1 (12%), CMS2 (41%), CMS3 (11%), CMS4 (34%). CMS distribution in right- versus (vs) left-sided primary tumors was as follows: CMS1 (27% versus 11%), CMS2 (28% versus 45%), CMS3 (10% versus 12%), CMS4 (35% versus 32%). Independent of the treatment, CMS was a strong prognostic factor for ORR (P = 0.051), PFS (P < 0.001), and OS (P < 0.001). Within the RAS wild-type population, OS observed in CMS4 significantly favored FOLFIRI cetuximab over FOLFIRI bevacizumab. In CMS3, OS showed a trend in favor of the cetuximab arm, while OS was comparable in CMS1 and CMS2, independent of targeted therapy. Conclusions CMS classification is prognostic for mCRC. Prolonged OS induced by FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in the FIRE-3 study appears to be driven by CMS3 and CMS4. CMS classification provides deeper insights into the biology to CRC, but at present time has no direct impact on clinical decision-making. The FIRE-3 (AIO KRK-0306) study had been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00433927.",

Due to the limitations of direct measurement methods, computational algorithms are often used to infer immune cell composition from bulk tumor transcriptome profiles. These estimated tumor immune infiltrate populations have been associated with genomic and transcriptomic changes in the tumors, providing insight into tumor–immune interactions. However, such investigations on large-scale public data remain challenging. To lower the barriers for the analysis of complex tumor–immune interactions, we significantly improved our previous web platform TIMER. Instead of just using one algorithm, TIMER2.0 (http://timer.cistrome.org/) provides more robust estimation of immune infiltration levels for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or user-provided tumor profiles using six state-of-the-art algorithms. TIMER2.0 provides four modules for investigating the associations between immune infiltrates and genetic or clinical features, and four modules for exploring cancer-related associations in the TCGA cohorts. Each module can generate a functional heatmap table, enabling the user to easily identify significant associations in multiple cancer types simultaneously. Overall, the TIMER2.0 web server provides comprehensive analysis and visualization functions of tumor infiltrating immune cells.",

However, the molecular mechanisms driving this response remain unclear and the effects on lipid metabolism are relatively unexplored. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyses the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids but also produces noncanonical 1-deoxysphingolipids when using alanine as a substrate 4 , 5 . Deoxysphingolipids accumulate in the context of mutations in SPTLC1 or SPTLC2 6 , 7 —or in conditions of low serine availability 8 , 9 —to drive neuropathy, and deoxysphinganine has previously been investigated as an anti-cancer agent 10 . Here we exploit amino acid metabolism and the promiscuity of SPT to modulate the endogenous synthesis of toxic deoxysphingolipids and slow tumour progression. Anchorage-independent growth reprogrammes a metabolic network involving serine, alanine and pyruvate that drives the endogenous synthesis and accumulation of deoxysphingolipids. Targeting the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier promotes alanine oxidation to mitigate deoxysphingolipid synthesis and improve spheroid growth, similar to phenotypes observed with the direct inhibition of SPT or ceramide synthesis. Restriction of dietary serine and glycine potently induces the accumulation of deoxysphingolipids while decreasing tumour growth in xenograft models in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of SPT rescues xenograft growth in mice fed diets restricted in serine and glycine, and the reduction of circulating serine by inhibition of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) leads to the accumulation of deoxysphingolipids and mitigates tumour growth. The promiscuity of SPT therefore links serine and mitochondrial alanine metabolism to membrane lipid diversity, which further sensitizes tumours to metabolic stress. In xenograft tumour models in mice, modulation of dietary serine, serine palmitoyltransferase or phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity enables control of the endogenous synthesis of deoxysphingolipids, sensitizing the tumours to metabolic stress and slowing their progression.",

However, only a minority of patients respond to treatment due to the stochastic heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advances in single-cell RNA-seq technologies enabled comprehensive characterization of the immune system heterogeneity in tumors, but also posed computational challenges on how to integrate and utilize the massive published datasets to inform immunotherapy. Here, we present Tumor Immune Single Cell Hub (TISCH, http://tisch.comp-genomics.org), a large-scale curated database that integrates single-cell transcriptomic profiles of nearly two million cells from 76 high-quality tumor datasets across 28 cancer types. All the data were uniformly processed with a standardized workflow, including quality control, batch effect removal, malignant cell classification, cell clustering, cell-type annotation, differential expression analysis, and functional enrichment analysis. TISCH provides interactive gene expression visualization across multiple datasets at the single-cell level or cluster level, allowing systematic comparison between different cell-types, patients, tissue origins, treatment and response groups, and even different cancer-types. In summary, TISCH provides a user-friendly interface for systematically visualizing, searching, and downloading gene expression atlas in the TME from multiple cancer types, enabling fast, flexible and comprehensive exploration of the TME.",

Despite remarkable progress in our molecular understanding of amino acid transport, metabolism and signaling, it remains unclear by what mechanisms cytosolic amino acid concentrations are maintained. We propose that amino acid transporters are the primary determinants of intracellular amino acid levels. We show that a cell’s endowment with amino acid transporters can be deconvoluted experimentally and used this data to computationally simulate amino acid translocation across the plasma membrane. Transport simulation generates cytosolic amino acid concentrations that are close to those observed in vitro. Perturbations of the system are replicated in silico and can be applied to systems where only transcriptomic data are available. This work explains amino acid homeostasis at the systems-level, through a combination of secondary active transporters, functionally acting as loaders, harmonizers and controller transporters to generate a stable equilibrium of all amino acid concentrations. Cytosolic amino acid concentrations are carefully maintained, but how homeostasis occurs is unclear. Here, the authors show that amino acid transporters primarily determine intracellular amino acid levels and develop a model that predicts a perturbation response similar to experimental data.",

            "abstract": "Description Tertiary lymphoid structures in cancer Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are lymphoid formations that are found in nonlymphoid tissues. TLS can develop in inflamed tissues and are associated with chronic inflammatory disorders, autoimmunity, and cancer. In the setting of tumors, TLSs facilitate the influx of immune cells into the tumor site and have therefore attracted interest as a means of improving anticancer immunity and favorable treatment response in patients. Schumacher and Thommen review the biology of TLSs and outline recent advances in TLS research. They discuss how TLSs are detected and defined, the mechanism(s) of formation in cancer, and the potential of targeting TLSs for therapeutic benefit. —PNK A review discusses tertiary lymphoid structures, ectopic lymphoid aggregates that are associated with tumors but the biology of which is not fully understood. BACKGROUND Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are organized aggregates of immune cells that form postnatally in nonlymphoid tissues. TLSs are not found under physiological conditions but arise in the context of chronic inflammation, such as in autoimmune disease, chronic infection, and cancer. With few exceptions, the presence of TLSs in tumors correlates with better prognosis and clinical outcome upon immunotherapy, but, in spite of their presumed importance, the drivers of TLS formation in cancer and the contribution of these structures to intratumoral immune responses remain incompletely understood. ADVANCES TLSs resemble secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) anatomically, and it was originally assumed that their formation would largely be induced by the same stimuli. However, the cell pools and signals that provide inductive stimuli for TLS formation are at least partially different. For instance, several observations suggest that tumor-specific T and B cell immunity may induce some of the molecular factors required for TLS formation and maintenance, and heterogeneity in these drivers may result in distinct TLS states. It has been speculated that TLSs recapitulate SLO functions at the inflamed tissue site, and available evidence suggests that a contribution of TLSs to the strength of tumor-specific immune responses is plausible. However, whether such a contribution primarily involves the boosting of T cell responses generated in SLOs or the development of new T and B cell reactivities remains a key unanswered question. In addition, the presence of TLSs at the tumor site may offer the possibility for the generation of qualitatively distinct immune responses. Specifically, because TLSs are not encapsulated, exposure of TLS-resident immune cells to macromolecules from the inflamed microenvironment appears to be a realistic possibility, and this could potentially sculpt the nature of intratumoral immune responses. Finally, recent studies suggest a role for TLSs in the clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade, which may make these structures attractive therapeutic targets. However, the development of such strategies should take into account the possible consequences of ectopic formation of lymphoid tissue at other body sites. OUTLOOK The prognostic and predictive value of TLSs in cancer has strengthened the interest in these structures as potential mediators of antitumor immunity. Although TLSs have been identified in many cancer types, the markers used to define and characterize TLSs have often varied across studies, complicating efforts to compare predictive value and to assess TLS heterogeneity between cancer types. Thus, the development of standardized approaches to measure TLS number and composition is likely to further reveal their predictive and prognostic value in different disease settings. Related to this, a more comprehensive characterization of TLSs may potentially lead to the identification of a spectrum of TLS states, based on aspects such as cellular composition, location, maturation, and function. Similar to the definition of T cell states in cancer, which has substantially improved our understanding of the role of specific T cell populations in tumor-specific immunity, the molecular definition of TLS states may help to improve their value as prognostic and predictive markers. Finally, a better appreciation of TLS function and the potential contribution of TLSs to autoimmune toxicity will be important to maximize their value as therapeutic targets. Defining TLS states. The molecular definition of TLS states may advance their use as prognostic and predictive markers. Characteristics that will provide insight into the diversity of TLS states include their cellular composition, location, and maturation; properties of their cytokine and chemokine environment; and their B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. AID, activation-induced cytidine deaminase; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; FRCs, follicular reticular cells; FDCs, follicular dendritic cells; HEVs, high endothelial venules; Ig, immunoglobulin; TFH, T follicular helper cell; TH, T helper cell; Treg, regulatory T cell. Ectopic lymphoid aggregates, termed tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), are formed in numerous cancer types, and, with few exceptions, their presence is associated with superior prognosis and response to immunotherapy. In spite of their presumed importance, the triggers that lead to TLS formation in cancer tissue and the contribution of these structures to intratumoral immune responses remain incompletely understood. Here, we discuss the present knowledge on TLSs in cancer, focusing on (i) the drivers of TLS formation, (ii) the function and contribution of TLSs to the antitumor immune response, and (iii) the potential of TLSs as therapeutic targets in human cancers.",

            "abstract": "Oxaliplatin is widely used in the frontline treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), but an estimated 50% of patients will eventually stop responding to treatment due to acquired resistance. This study revealed that diminished MEIS1 expression was detected in CRC and harmed the survival of CRC patients. MEIS1 impaired CRC cell viabilities and tumor growth in mice and enhanced CRC cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin by preventing DNA damage repair. Mechanistically, oxaliplatin resistance following MEIS1 suppression was critically dependent on enhanced FEN1 expression. Subsequently, we confirmed that EZH2-DNMT3a was assisted by lncRNA ELFN1-AS1 in locating the promoter of MEIS1 to suppress MEIS1 transcription epigenetically. Based on the above, therapeutics targeting the role of MEIS1 in oxaliplatin resistance were developed and our results suggested that the combination of oxaliplatin with either ELFN1-AS1 ASO or EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 could largely suppress tumor growth and reverse oxaliplatin resistance. This study highlights the potential of therapeutics targeting ELFN1-AS1 and EZH2 in cell survival and oxaliplatin resistance, based on their controlling of MEIS1 expression, which deserve further verification as a prospective therapeutic strategy.",

To assist the public health community in better serving these individuals, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate triennially to estimate cancer prevalence in the United States using incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries, vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics, and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Current treatment patterns based on information in the National Cancer Database are presented for the most prevalent cancer types by race, and cancer‐related and treatment‐related side‐effects are also briefly described. More than 18 million Americans (8.3 million males and 9.7 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2022. The 3 most prevalent cancers are prostate (3,523,230), melanoma of the skin (760,640), and colon and rectum (726,450) among males and breast (4,055,770), uterine corpus (891,560), and thyroid (823,800) among females. More than one‐half (53%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and two‐thirds (67%) were aged 65 years or older. One of the largest racial disparities in treatment is for rectal cancer, for which 41% of Black patients with stage I disease receive proctectomy or proctocolectomy compared to 66% of White patients. Surgical receipt is also substantially lower among Black patients with non‐small cell lung cancer, 49% for stages I‐II and 16% for stage III versus 55% and 22% for White patients, respectively. These treatment disparities are exacerbated by the fact that Black patients continue to be less likely to be diagnosed with stage I disease than White patients for most cancers, with some of the largest disparities for female breast (53% vs 68%) and endometrial (59% vs 73%). Although there are a growing number of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence‐based strategies and equitable access to available resources are needed to mitigate disparities for communities of color and optimize care for people with a history of cancer.

            "abstract": "The phenomenon of T Cell exhaustion (TEX) entails a progressive deterioration in the functionality of T cells within the immune system during prolonged conflicts with chronic infections or tumors. In the context of ovarian cancer immunotherapy, the development, and outcome of treatment are closely linked to T-cell exhaustion. Hence, gaining an in-depth understanding of the features of TEX within the immune microenvironment of ovarian cancer is of paramount importance for the management of OC patients. To this end, we leveraged single-cell RNA data from OC to perform clustering and identify T-cell marker genes utilizing the Unified Modal Approximation and Projection (UMAP) approach. Through GSVA and WGCNA in bulk RNA-seq data, we identified 185 TEX-related genes (TEXRGs). Subsequently, we transformed ten machine learning algorithms into 80 combinations and selected the most optimal one to construct TEX-related prognostic features (TEXRPS) based on the mean C-index of the three OC cohorts. In addition, we explored the disparities in clinicopathological features, mutational status, immune cell infiltration, and immunotherapy efficacy between the high-risk (HR) and low-risk (LR) groups. Upon the integration of clinicopathological features, TEXRPS displayed robust predictive power. Notably, patients in the LR group exhibited a superior prognosis, higher tumor mutational load (TMB), greater immune cell infiltration abundance, and enhanced sensitivity to immunotherapy. Lastly, we verified the differential expression of the model gene CD44 using qRT-PCR. In conclusion, our study offers a valuable tool to guide clinical management and targeted therapy of OC.",

            "abstract": "CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and suppress the immune system. Whether and how metabolite availability in the TME influences Treg cell differentiation is not understood. Here, we measured 630 metabolites in the TME and found that serine and palmitic acid, substrates required for the synthesis of sphingolipids, were enriched. A serine-free diet or a deficiency in Sptlc2, the rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing sphingolipid synthesis, suppressed Treg cell accumulation and inhibited tumor growth. Sphinganine, an intermediate metabolite in sphingolipid synthesis, physically interacted with the transcription factor c-Fos. Sphinganine c-Fos interactions enhanced the genome-wide recruitment of c-Fos to regions near the transcription start sites of target genes including Pdcd1 (encoding PD-1), which promoted Pdcd1 transcription and increased inducible Treg cell differentiation in vitro in a PD-1–dependent manner. Thus, Sptlc2-mediated sphingolipid synthesis translates the extracellular information of metabolite availability into nuclear signals for Treg cell differentiation and limits antitumor immunity. Sphingolipid synthesis promotes Treg cell–mediated immunosuppression in tumors through the sphinganine-c-Fos–PD-1 axis. Editor’s summary Immunotherapies targeting T cells are a promising approach to treating many cancer types, but their success is limited by the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a key role in immune suppression, but whether nutrient availability in the TME influences Treg differentiation is unclear. Ma et al. profiled metabolites in the tumor interstitial fluid of tumor-bearing mice and identified an enrichment of substrates for the sphingolipid synthesis pathway. The intermediate metabolite sphinganine was required for Treg differentiation and immune suppression by directly interacting with the transcription factor c-Fos, promoting the transcription of c-Fos target genes including Pdcd1. These findings demonstrate that nutrient availability in the TME influences Treg cell accumulation and immune suppression. —Hannah Isles",

            "abstract": "Serine is a key contributor to the generation of one-carbon units for DNA synthesis during cellular proliferation. In addition, it plays a crucial role in the production of antioxidants that prevent abnormal proliferation and stress in cancer cells. In recent studies, the relationship between cancer metabolism and the serine biosynthesis pathway has been highlighted. In this context, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is notable as a key enzyme that functions as the primary rate-limiting enzyme in the serine biosynthesis pathway, facilitating the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate. Elevated PHGDH activity in diverse cancer cells is mediated through genetic amplification, posttranslational modification, increased transcription, and allosteric regulation. Ultimately, these characteristics allow PHGDH to not only influence the growth and progression of cancer but also play an important role in metastasis and drug resistance. Consequently, PHGDH has emerged as a crucial focal point in cancer research. In this review, the structural aspects of PHGDH and its involvement in one-carbon metabolism are investigated, and PHGDH is proposed as a potential therapeutic target in diverse cancers. By elucidating how PHGDH expression promotes cancer growth, the goal of this review is to provide insight into innovative treatment strategies. This paper aims to reveal how PHGDH inhibitors can overcome resistance mechanisms, contributing to the development of effective cancer treatments.",

Our study identified a novel plasma cell signature, Plasma cell.Sig, through a pan‐cancer single‐cell RNA sequencing analysis, which predicts patient outcomes to immunotherapy with remarkable accuracy. The signature was developed using rigorous machine learning algorithms and validated across multiple cohorts, demonstrating superior predictive power with an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.7. Notably, the low‐risk group, as classified by Plasma cell.Sig, exhibited enriched immune cell infiltration and heightened tumor immunogenicity, indicating an enhanced responsiveness to immunotherapy. Conversely, the high‐risk group showed reduced immune activity and potential mechanisms of immune evasion. These findings not only enhance understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic immune landscapes within the tumor microenvironment but also pave the way for more precise, biomarker‐guided immunotherapy approaches in oncology.",

Our research demonstrates that iMLGAM scores exhibit superior predictive performance across independent cohorts, with lower scores correlating significantly with enhanced therapeutic responses and outperforming existing clinical biomarkers. Detailed analysis revealed that tumors with low iMLGAM scores display distinctive immune microenvironment characteristics, including increased immune cell infiltration and amplified antitumor immune responses. Critically, through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screening, we identified Centrosomal Protein 55 (CEP55) as a key molecule modulating tumor immune evasion, mechanistically confirming its role in regulating T cell‐mediated antitumor immune responses. These findings not only validate iMLGAM as a powerful prognostic tool but also propose CEP55 as a promising therapeutic target, offering novel strategies to enhance ICB treatment efficacy. The iMLGAM package is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/Yelab1994/iMLGAM), providing researchers with an innovative approach to personalized cancer immunotherapy prediction.",

        "abstract": "Although microwave ablation (MWA) is an important curative therapy in colorectal cancer liver metastasis, recurrence still occurs clinically. Our previous studies have shown that the expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD‐L1) is upregulated following MWA, suggesting that MWA combined with anti‐PD‐L1 treatment can serve as a promising clinical therapeutic strategy against cancer. Using MWA‐treated preclinical mice models, MWA combined with αPD‐L1 treatment decreased tumor growth and prolonged overall survival (OS). Furthermore, through flow cytometry and single‐cell RNA sequencing analysis, we determined that the MWA plus αPD‐L1 therapy significantly suppressed CD8+ T cell exhaustion and enhanced their effector function. A significant increase in γ‐interferon (IFN‐γ) stimulated transcription factors, specifically Irf8, was observed. This enhancement facilitated the polarization of tumor‐associated macrophages (TAM1s and TAM2s) through the nuclear factor‐κB/JAK‐STAT1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the combination therapy stimulated the production of CXC motif chemokine ligand (CXCL9) by TAM1s and tumor cells, potentially increasing the chemotaxis of CD8 T cells and Th1 cells. Knocking out Cxcl9 in MC38 tumor cells or using CXCL9 blockade enhanced tumor growth of untreated tumors and shortened OS. Taken together, our study showed that blocking the IFN‐γ‐Cxcl9‐CD8+ T axis promoted tumor progression and discovered a potential involvement of IRF8‐regulated TAMs in preventing T cell exhaustion. Collectively, we identified that the combination of MWA with anti‐PD‐L1 treatment holds promise as a therapeutic strategy to rejuvenate the immune response against tumors. This merits further exploration in clinical studies.",

            "abstract": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a malignancy of skin-homing T-cells. Long-term remissions are rare in CTCL, and the pathophysiology of long-lasting disease control is unknown. Mogamulizumab is a defucosylated anti-human CCR4 antibody that depletes CCR4-expressing CTCL tumor cells and peripheral blood memory regulatory T cells. Prolonged remissions and immune side effects have been observed in mogamulizumab-treated CTCL patients. We report that mogamulizumab induced skin rashes in 32% of 44 CTCL patients. These rashes were associated with long-term CTCL remission, even in the absence of specific CTCL treatment. CTCL patients with mogamulizumab-induced rash had significantly higher overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.16 (0.04-0.73, p=0.01)). Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the rashes revealed granulomatous and lichenoid patterns with CD163 macrophagic and CD8 T-cell infiltrates. Depletion of skin CTCL cells was confirmed by high-throughput sequencing analysis of TCRβ genes and in blood by flow cytometry. New reactive T-cell clones were recruited in skin. Gene expression analysis showed overexpression of CXCL9 and CXCL11, two chemokines involved in CXCR3-expressing T-cell homing to skin. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in skin of CTCL patients confirmed that CXCL9 and CXCL11 were primarily macrophage-derived and that skin T-cells expressed CXCR3. Finally, patients with rashes had a significantly higher proportion of exhausted reactive blood T-cells expressing TIGIT and PD1 at baseline compared to patients without rash, which decreased under mogamulizumab treatment, consistent with an activation of the antitumor immunity. Together, these data suggest that mogamulizumab may induce long-term immune control in CTCL patients by activation of the macrophagic and T-cell immune responses.",

        "abstract": "Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) involves tumor cells seeding distant organs. Metastatic CRC genome biology has intrinsic properties related to heterogeneous clonal tumor cells and extrinsic properties of the cellular niche of the tumor microenvironment (TME). To characterize mCRC’s cell types and states, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) on metastases in the liver and omentum, a tissue lining the abdomen. We performed scRNA-seq on 49,637 cells derived from mCRC, paired normal tissue and peripheral blood. We performed whole genome scDNA-seq on 3,683 mCRC cells from the same samples. These metastases had intrinsic heterogeneity, with clone-specific copy number variation and lineage differentiation. For the extrinsic niche, TME macrophages had a cellular state resembling cirrhotic macrophages and foam cells with indicators of increased activity for extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. TME fibroblasts had an expression program influencing ECM composition that was not observed in matched normal tissue. Only a few CD8 T cells were present among the liver mCRCs, indicating immune exclusion. Receptor-ligand analysis revealed that TME macrophages and fibroblasts formed an interactome, thus providing intercellular coordination which increased T cell exhaustion and exclusion. For one mCRC, we used in a patient-derivedex vivotissue model that captures the TME components of the original metastatic tumor, applied specific perturbations to the TME immune cells and evaluated cellular state changes with scRNA-seq. Overall, our study identified tumor cell clonal variation, characterized specific TME properties of the CRC metastatic niche and demonstrated an experimental model of perturbing the cellular TME milieu.",

            "abstract": "The T-cell surface molecule TIGIT is an immune checkpoint molecule that inhibits T-cell responses, but its roles in cancer are little understood. In this study, we evaluated the role TIGIT checkpoint plays in the development and progression of gastric cancer. We show that the percentage of CD8 T cells that are TIGIT+ was increased in gastric cancer patients compared with healthy individuals. These cells showed functional exhaustion with impaired activation, proliferation, cytokine production, and metabolism, all of which were rescued by glucose. In addition, gastric cancer tissue and cell lines expressed CD155, which bound TIGIT receptors and inactivated CD8 T cells. In a T cell-gastric cancer cell coculture system, gastric cancer cells deprived CD8 T cells of glucose and impaired CD8 T-cell effector functions; these effects were neutralized by the additional glucose or by TIGIT blockade. In gastric cancer tumor cells, CD155 silencing increased T-cell metabolism and IFNγ production, whereas CD155 overexpression inhibited T-cell metabolism and IFNγ production; this inhibition was neutralized by TIGIT blockade. Targeting CD155/TIGIT enhanced CD8 T-cell reaction and improved survival in tumor-bearing mice. Combined targeting of TIGIT and PD-1 further enhanced CD8 T-cell activation and improved survival in tumor-bearing mice. Our results suggest that gastric cancer cells inhibit CD8 T-cell metabolism through CD155/TIGIT signaling, which inhibits CD8 T-cell effector functions, resulting in hyporesponsive antitumor immunity. These findings support the candidacy of CD155/TIGIT as a potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer. Cancer Res; 77(22); 6375-88. ©2017 AACR.",

HEY1 overexpression was a negative prognostic factor for all CRC patients (HR=1.29, P=0.023) and strongly correlated with perineural and vascular invasion and lymph node (LN) metastasis. In 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated patients, the tumour overexpression of SOX9 correlated with markedly poorer survival (HR=8.72, P=0.034), but had no predictive effect in untreated patients (HR=0.70, P=0.29). When HEY1, HES1 and SOX9 expression were combined to predict survival with chemotherapy, in treated patients there was an additive increase in the risk of death with each NTF overexpressed (HR=2.09, P=0.01), but no prognostic import in the untreated patient group (HR=0.74, P=0.19).Conclusion:The present study is the first to discover that HEY1 overexpression correlates with poorer outcome in CRC, and NTF expression is predictive of CRC patient survival with 5-FU chemotherapy. If confirmed in future studies, testing of NTF expression has the potential to enter routine pathological practice for the selection of patients to undergo chemotherapy alone or in combination with Notch inhibitors.",

Despite the development of technologies and therapeutic strategies, metastasis is still the major cause of cancer-related death until today. The famous “seed and soil” hypothesis is widely cited and accepted, and it still provides significant instructions in cancer research until today. To our knowledge, there are few reviews that comprehensively and correlatively focus on both the seed and soil factors involved in cancer metastasis; moreover, despite the fact that increasingly underlying mechanisms and concepts have been defined recently, previous perspectives are appealing but may be limited. Hence, we reviewed factors involved in cancer metastasis, including both seed and soil factors. By integrating new concepts with the classic hypothesis, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the “seed and soil” hypothesis and to conceptualize the framework for understanding factors involved in cancer metastasis. Based on a dynamic overview of this field, we also discuss potential implications for future research and clinical therapeutic strategies.",

We present here a proteomic strategy developed to characterize the in vivo ECM composition of normal tissues and tumors using enrichment of protein extracts for ECM components and subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry. In parallel, we have developed a bioinformatic approach to predict the in silico “matrisome” defined as the ensemble of ECM proteins and associated factors. We report the characterization of the extracellular matrices of murine lung and colon, each comprising more than 100 ECM proteins and each presenting a characteristic signature. Moreover, using human tumor xenografts in mice, we show that both tumor cells and stromal cells contribute to the production of the tumor matrix and that tumors of differing metastatic potential differ in both the tumor- and the stroma-derived ECM components. The strategy we describe and illustrate here can be broadly applied and, to facilitate application of these methods by others, we provide resources including laboratory protocols, inventories of ECM domains and proteins, and instructions for bioinformatically deriving the human and mouse matrisome.",

            "abstract": "T follicular helper cells (TFH cells) are important regulators of antigen-specific B cell responses. The B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 has recently been linked with TFH cell infiltration and improved survival in human cancer. Although human TFH cells can produce CXCL13, their immune functions are currently unknown. This study presents data from human breast cancer, advocating a role for tumor-infiltrating CXCL13-producing (CXCR5-) TFH cells, here named TFHX13 cells, in promoting local memory B cell differentiation. TFHX13 cells potentially trigger tertiary lymphoid structure formation and thereby generate germinal center B cell responses at the tumor site. Follicular DCs are not potent CXCL13 producers in breast tumor tissues. We used the TFH cell markers PD-1 and ICOS to identify distinct effector and regulatory CD4+ T cell subpopulations in breast tumors. TFHX13 cells are an important component of the PD-1hiICOSint effector subpopulation and coexpanded with PD-1intICOShiFOXP3hi Tregs. IL2 deprivation induces CXCL13 expression in vitro with a synergistic effect from TGFβ1, providing insight into TFHX13 cell differentiation in response to Treg accumulation, similar to conventional TFH cell responses. Our data suggest that human TFHX13 cell differentiation may be a key factor in converting Treg-mediated immune suppression to de novo activation of adaptive antitumor humoral responses in the chronic inflammatory breast cancer microenvironment.",

While many different scoring systems have been developed based on those clinic-pathological factors with disparate results, there has been the introduction of genetic biological markers that added a theranostic perspective. More recently, other important elements, such as those factors related to the host immune system, have been proposed as determinants of prognosis of CLM patients. In the present work, we review the current prognostic factors of CLM patients as well as the burgeoning shifting paradigm of prognostication that relies on the host immune system.",

However, little is known about the cells that make up the human liver and its immune microenvironment. Here we report a map of the cellular landscape of the human liver using single-cell RNA sequencing. We provide the transcriptional profiles of 8444 parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells obtained from the fractionation of fresh hepatic tissue from five human livers. Using gene expression patterns, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical examinations, we identify 20 discrete cell populations of hepatocytes, endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, B cells, conventional and non-conventional T cells, NK-like cells, and distinct intrahepatic monocyte/macrophage populations. Together, our study presents a comprehensive view of the human liver at single-cell resolution that outlines the characteristics of resident cells in the liver, and in particular provides a map of the human hepatic immune microenvironment. The development of single cell RNA sequencing technologies has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of tissue biology. Here, MacParland et al. performed single cell RNA sequencing of human liver samples, and identify distinct populations of intrahepatic macrophages that may play specific roles in liver disease.",

This clinical conundrum suggests that additional immune checkpoints exist. We report here that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) deficiency led to impairment of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation and allograft tumor tolerance. However, analysis of chimera mice with competitive reconstitution of WT and IRF8-KO bone marrow cells as well as mice with IRF8 deficiency only in T cells indicated that IRF8 plays no intrinsic role in CTL activation. Instead, IRF8 functioned as a repressor of osteopontin (OPN), the physiological ligand for CD44 on T cells, in CD11b+Ly6CloLy6G+ myeloid cells and OPN acted as a potent T cell suppressor. IRF8 bound to the Spp1 promoter to repress OPN expression in colon epithelial cells, and colon carcinoma exhibited decreased IRF8 and increased OPN expression. The elevated expression of OPN in human colon carcinoma was correlated with decreased patient survival. Our data indicate that myeloid and tumor cell–expressed OPN acts as an immune checkpoint to suppress T cell activation and confer host tumor immune tolerance.",

Here we characterize the evolutionary dynamics of this lethal process by analyzing exome-sequencing data from 118 biopsies from 23 patients with colorectal cancer with metastases to the liver or brain. The data show that the genomic divergence between the primary tumor and metastasis is low and that canonical driver genes were acquired early. Analysis within a spatial tumor growth model and statistical inference framework indicates that early disseminated cells commonly (81%, 17 out of 21 evaluable patients) seed metastases while the carcinoma is clinically undetectable (typically, less than 0.01 cm3). We validated the association between early drivers and metastasis in an independent cohort of 2,751 colorectal cancers, demonstrating their utility as biomarkers of metastasis. This conceptual and analytical framework provides quantitative in vivo evidence that systemic spread can occur early in colorectal cancer and illuminates strategies for patient stratification and therapeutic targeting of the canonical drivers of tumorigenesis. Analysis of evolutionary dynamics of colorectal cancers and paired distant brain or liver metastases provides evidence that early disseminated cancer cells seed metastases before the carcinoma is clinically detectable.",

            "abstract": "Purpose: The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of a heterogenous cellular milieu that can influence cancer cell behavior. Its characteristics have an impact on treatments such as immunotherapy. These features can be revealed with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We hypothesized that scRNA-seq analysis of gastric cancer together with paired normal tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) would identify critical elements of cellular deregulation not apparent with other approaches. Experimental Design: scRNA-seq was conducted on seven patients with gastric cancer and one patient with intestinal metaplasia. We sequenced 56,167 cells comprising gastric cancer (32,407 cells), paired normal tissue (18,657 cells), and PBMCs (5,103 cells). Protein expression was validated by multiplex immunofluorescence. Results: Tumor epithelium had copy number alterations, a distinct gene expression program from normal, with intratumor heterogeneity. Gastric cancer TME was significantly enriched for stromal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and Tregs. TME-exclusive stromal cells expressed distinct extracellular matrix components than normal. Macrophages were transcriptionally heterogenous and did not conform to a binary M1/M2 paradigm. Tumor DCs had a unique gene expression program compared to PBMC DCs. TME-specific cytotoxic T cells were exhausted with two heterogenous subsets. Helper, cytotoxic T, Treg, and NK cells expressed multiple immune checkpoint or co-stimulatory molecules. Receptor–ligand analysis revealed TME-exclusive intercellular communication. Conclusions: Single-cell gene expression studies revealed widespread reprogramming across multiple cellular elements in the gastric cancer TME. Cellular remodeling was delineated by changes in cell numbers, transcriptional states, and intercellular interactions. This characterization facilitates understanding of tumor biology and enables identification of novel targets including for immunotherapy.",

As such, they are a potential target for optimizing therapeutic strategies against cancer. However, many challenges are present in ongoing attempts to modulate CAFs for therapeutic benefit. These include limitations in our understanding of the origin of CAFs and heterogeneity in CAF function, with it being desirable to retain some antitumorigenic functions. On the basis of a meeting of experts in the field of CAF biology, we summarize in this Consensus Statement our current knowledge and present a framework for advancing our understanding of this critical cell type within the tumour microenvironment. This Consensus Statement highlights the importance of cancer-associated fibroblasts in cancer biology and progression, and issues a call to action for all cancer researchers to standardize assays and report metadata in studies of cancer-associated fibroblasts to advance our understanding of this important cell type in the tumour microenvironment.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) remain the most common subset in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors and featured by aggressiveness. However, the molecular feature of SI-NETs remains largely unclear with key genes and pathways yet to be identified. The gene expression profile GSE65286 was retrieved for analysis. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were constructed for the hub genes network models. A total of 613 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between normal (N) and primary tumor (T) groups, whereas 61 DEGs were identified between T and liver metastases (LM) groups. The top Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways for the DEGs of N versus T were fat digestion and absorption pathway. For T versus LM the top KEGG pathways were complement and coagulation. In gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), five gene sets, including Notch signaling, inflammatory response, coagulation, KRAS signaling, and allograft rejection were significantly enriched in the T group. The hub genes in the DEGs of T versus LM included albumin, fibrinogen gamma chain, alpha 2-HS glycoprotein, transferrin and GC, vitamin D binding protein. A distinct correlational alteration of hub genes was observed between T and LM groups. In ANN analysis, ALB and TF were the top predictors of metastasis. Moreover, the expression of ALB≤ showed the highest support to T whereas ALB>15.97 supports LM. TF≤7.54 showed the highest negative correlation to the T. This bioinformatics analysis provided insights on potential key pathways and genes networks involved in SI-NETs and established an ANN-based hub gene model for metastatic prediction.",

An outstanding question is to what extent this heterogeneity is similar between cancers affecting different organs. Here, we profile 233,591 single cells from patients with lung, colorectal, ovary and breast cancer ( n  = 36) and construct a pan-cancer blueprint of stromal cell heterogeneity using different single-cell RNA and protein-based technologies. We identify 68 stromal cell populations, of which 46 are shared between cancer types and 22 are unique. We also characterise each population phenotypically by highlighting its marker genes, transcription factors, metabolic activities and tissue-specific expression differences. Resident cell types are characterised by substantial tissue specificity, while tumor-infiltrating cell types are largely shared across cancer types. Finally, by applying the blueprint to melanoma tumors treated with checkpoint immunotherapy and identifying a naïve CD4 + T-cell phenotype predictive of response to checkpoint immunotherapy, we illustrate how it can serve as a guide to interpret scRNA-seq data. In conclusion, by providing a comprehensive blueprint through an interactive web server, we generate the first panoramic view on the shared complexity of stromal cells in different cancers.",

        "abstract": "Background Poor prognosis in colon cancer is associated with a high content of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The relationship between these two features is incompletely understood. Here, we aimed to generate a model system for studying the interaction between cancer cells and CAFs and their effect on immune-related cytokines and T cell proliferation. Methods CAFs were isolated from colon cancer liver metastases and were immortalized to prolong lifespan and improve robustness and reproducibility. Established medium and matrix compositions that support the growth of patient-derived organoids were adapted to also support CAF growth. Changes in growth pattern and cellular re-organization were assessed by confocal microscopy, live cell imaging, and immunofluorescence. Single cell RNA sequencing was used to study CAF/organoid co-culture-induced phenotypic changes in both cell types. Conditioned media were used to quantify the production of immunosuppressive factors and to assess their effect on T cell proliferation. Results We developed a co-culture system in which colon cancer organoids and CAFs spontaneously organize into superstructures with a high capacity to contract and stiffen the extracellular matrix (ECM). CAF-produced collagen IV provided a basement membrane supporting cancer cell organization into glandular structures, reminiscent of human cancer histology. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis showed that CAFs induced a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition in a subpopulation of cancer cells, similar to what is observed in the mesenchymal-like consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4) colon cancer. CAFs in co-culture were characterized by high expression of ECM components, ECM-remodeling enzymes, glycolysis, hypoxia, and genes involved in immunosuppression. An expression signature derived from CAFs in co-culture identified a subpopulation of glycolytic myofibroblasts specifically residing in CMS1 and CMS4 colon cancer. Medium conditioned by co-cultures contained high levels of the immunosuppressive factors TGFβ1, VEGFA and lactate, and potently inhibited T cell proliferation. Conclusion Co-cultures of organoids and immortalized CAFs recapitulate the histological, biophysical, and immunosuppressive features of aggressive mesenchymal-like human CRC. The model can be used to study the mechanisms of immunosuppression and to test therapeutic strategies targeting the cross-talk between CAFs and cancer cells. It can be further modified to represent distinct colon cancer subtypes and (organ-specific) microenvironments.",

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.",

To resolve inconsistencies among the reported gene expression–based CRC classifications and facilitate clinical translation, we formed an international consortium dedicated to large-scale data sharing and analytics across expert groups. We show marked interconnectivity between six independent classification systems coalescing into four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) with distinguishing features: CMS1 (microsatellite instability immune, 14%), hypermutated, microsatellite unstable and strong immune activation; CMS2 (canonical, 37%), epithelial, marked WNT and MYC signaling activation; CMS3 (metabolic, 13%), epithelial and evident metabolic dysregulation; and CMS4 (mesenchymal, 23%), prominent transforming growth factor–β activation, stromal invasion and angiogenesis. Samples with mixed features (13%) possibly represent a transition phenotype or intratumoral heterogeneity. We consider the CMS groups the most robust classification system currently available for CRC—with clear biological interpretability—and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.",

We hypothesized that tumors with a large number of somatic mutations due to mismatch-repair defects may be susceptible to immune checkpoint blockade.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a phase 2 study to evaluate the clinical activity of pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, in 41 patients with progressive metastatic carcinoma with or without mismatch-repair deficiency. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 14 days in patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers, patients with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers, and patients with mismatch repair-deficient cancers that were not colorectal. The coprimary end points were the immune-related objective response rate and the 20-week immune-related progression-free survival rate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe immune-related objective response rate and immune-related progression-free survival rate were 40% (4 of 10 patients) and 78% (7 of 9 patients), respectively, for mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancers and 0% (0 of 18 patients) and 11% (2 of 18 patients) for mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were not reached in the cohort with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer but were 2.2 and 5.0 months, respectively, in the cohort with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.10 [P<0.001], and hazard ratio for death, 0.22 [P=0.05]). Patients with mismatch repair-deficient noncolorectal cancer had responses similar to those of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer (immune-related objective response rate, 71% [5 of 7 patients]; immune-related progression-free survival rate, 67% [4 of 6 patients]). Whole-exome sequencing revealed a mean of 1782 somatic mutations per tumor in mismatch repair-deficient tumors, as compared with 73 in mismatch repair-proficient tumors (P=0.007), and high somatic mutation loads were associated with prolonged progression-free survival (P=0.02).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study showed that mismatch-repair status predicted clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab.

            "abstract": "Here, we propose a new model for understanding the Warburg effect in tumor metabolism. Our hypothesis is that epithelial cancer cells induce the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) in neighboring stromal fibroblasts. These cancer-associated fibroblasts, then undergo myo-fibroblastic differentiation, and secrete lactate and pyruvate (energy metabolites resulting from aerobic glycolysis). Epithelial cancer cells could then take up these energy-rich metabolites and use them in the mitochondrial TCA cycle, thereby promoting efficient energy production (ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation), resulting in a higher proliferative capacity. In this alternative model of tumorigenesis, the epithelial cancer cells instruct the normal stroma to transform into a wound-healing stroma, providing the necessary energy-rich micro-environment for facilitating tumor growth and angiogenesis. In essence, the fibroblastic tumor stroma would directly feed the epithelial cancer cells, in a type of host-parasite relationship. We have termed this new idea the \"Reverse Warburg Effect.\" In this scenario, the epithelial tumor cells \"corrupt\" the normal stroma, turning it into a factory for the production of energy-rich metabolites. This alternative model is still consistent with Warburg's original observation that tumors show a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis. In support of this idea, unbiased proteomic analysis and transcriptional profiling of a new model of cancer-associated fibroblasts (caveolin-1 (Cav-1) deficient stromal cells), shows the up-regulation of both i) myo-fibroblast markers and ii) glycolytic enzymes, under normoxic conditions. We validated the expression of these proteins in the fibroblastic stroma of human breast cancer tissues that lack stromal Cav-1. Importantly, a loss of stromal Cav-1 in human breast cancers is associated with tumor recurrence, metastasis, and poor clinical outcome. Thus, an absence of stromal Cav-1 may be a biomarker for the \"Reverse Warburg Effect\", explaining its powerful predictive value.",

To better understand this transcriptional cascade we performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation using antibodies to two major HIF-α subunits, and correlated the results with genome-wide transcript profiling. Within a tiled promoter array we identified 546 and 143 sequences that bound, respectively, to HIF-1α or HIF-2α at high stringency. Analysis of these sequences confirmed an identical core binding motif for HIF-1α and HIF-2α (RCGTG) but demonstrated that binding to this motif was highly selective, with binding enriched at distinct regions both upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start. Comparison of HIF-promoter binding data with bidirectional HIF-dependent changes in transcript expression indicated that whereas a substantial proportion of positive responses (>20% across all significantly regulated genes) are direct, HIF-dependent gene suppression is almost entirely indirect. Comparison of HIF-1α- versus HIF-2α-binding sites revealed that whereas some loci bound HIF-1α in isolation, many bound both isoforms with similar affinity. Despite high-affinity binding to multiple promoters, HIF-2α contributed to few, if any, of the transcriptional responses to acute hypoxia at these loci. Given emerging evidence for biologically distinct functions of HIF-1α versus HIF-2α understanding the mechanisms restricting HIF-2α activity will be of interest.",

We utilised an adapted version of a previously developed 3D in vitro model of colorectal cancer, composed of a cancer mass and the surrounding stromal compartment. We compared cancer invasion with an acellular stromal surround, a “healthy” or normal cellular stroma and a cancerous stroma. For the cancerous stroma, we incorporated six patient-derived CAF samples to study their differential effects on cancer growth, vascular network formation and remodelling. CAFs enhanced the distance and surface area of the invasive cancer mass whilst inhibiting vascular-like network formation. These processes correlated with the upregulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1) and fibulin-5 (FBLN5). Vascular remodelling of previously formed endothelial structures occurred through the disruption of complex networks, and was associated with the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) and downregulation in vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-Cadherin). These results support, within a biomimetic 3D, in vitro framework, the direct role of CAFs in promoting cancer invasion, and their key function in driving vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.",

About half of patients are affected by metastasis, with the cancer spreading to e.g., liver, lungs or the peritoneum. The majority of these patients cannot be cured despite steady advances in treatment options. Immunotherapies are currently not widely applicable for this disease, yet show potential in preclinical models and clinical translation. The tumour microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a key factor in CRC metastasis, including by means of immune evasion—forming a major barrier to effective immuno-oncology. Several approaches are in development that aim to overcome the immunosuppressive environment and boost anti-tumour immunity. Among them are vaccination strategies, cellular transplantation therapies, and targeted treatments. Given the complexity of the system, we argue for rational design of combinatorial therapies and consider the implications of precision medicine in this context.",

Salvage immunotherapy after liver metastases Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy with anti–PD-1 is less effective in patients with cancer who have tumors that have metastasized to the liver. To unravel the mechanistic basis of suppressed antitumor immunity in this patient group, Lee et al. developed a preclinical mouse model in which liver tumors led to antigen-specific suppression of systemic immunity to extrahepatic tumors. Suppressed tumor immunity was associated with CTLA-4hi Tregs responsible for inducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Depletion of tumor-resident Tregs by anti–CTLA-4 treatment or functional inactivation of Tregs by treatment with an EZH2 inhibitor rescued the therapeutic potential of PD-1 blockade. The findings from the mouse model provide a basis for pursuing translational studies of salvage immunotherapy approaches that combine anti–PD-1 with Treg-targeting agents in patients with cancer and hepatic metastases. Patients with cancer with liver metastasis demonstrate significantly worse outcomes than those without liver metastasis when treated with anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. The mechanism of liver metastases–induced reduction in systemic antitumor immunity is unclear. Using a dual-tumor immunocompetent mouse model, we found that the immune response to tumor antigen presence within the liver led to the systemic suppression of antitumor immunity. The immune suppression was antigen specific and associated with the coordinated activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and modulation of intratumoral CD11b+ monocytes. The dysfunctional immune state could not be reversed by anti–PD-1 monotherapy unless Treg cells were depleted (anti–CTLA-4) or destabilized (EZH2 inhibitor). Thus, this study provides a mechanistic understanding and rationale for adding Treg and CD11b+ monocyte targeting agents in combination with anti–PD-1 to treat patients with cancer with liver metastasis.",

We found that the expression levels of several genes, which are highly expressed in original CRC tissues, were downregulated in organoids but re-expressed in organoids by co-culturing with CAFs. They comprised immune response- and external stimulus-related genes, e.g., REG family and dual oxidases ( DUOX s), which are known to have malignant functions, leading tumor cells to proliferative and/or anti-apoptotic states and drug resistant phenotypes. In addition, the degree of differential induction of REG1 and DUOX2 in the co-culture system varied depending on CAFs from each CRC case. In conclusion, the co-culture system of CRC organoids with paired CAFs was able to partially reproduce the tumor microenvironment.",

However, only subsets of patients with specific tumor types respond to ICT. Thus, significant challenges remain, including understanding pathways of resistance, optimizing patient selection, improving management of immune-related adverse events, and identifying rational therapeutic combinations. These challenges will need a focused approach encompassing both clinical and basic research, with the integration of reverse translational studies. This integrated approach will lead to identification of potential targets for subsequent clinical trials, which will guide decisions as we develop novel combination strategies to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicities for patients. SIGNIFICANCE: ICTs induce durable antitumor responses for subsets of patients with cancer. Recent evidence suggests that rational combinatorial strategies can improve response by overcoming primary and adaptive resistance mechanisms, although these may carry an increased risk of immune-mediated toxicities. This review surveys the current understanding of mechanisms of response and resistance to ICTs and active areas of investigation, and proposes a path forward to improving efficacy and minimizing toxicities through better patient selection and rational combinations.",

Using CRC clinical samples together with ex vivo CAFs-CRC co-culture models, we found that CAFs induce expression of Leucine Rich Alpha-2-Glycoprotein 1(LRG1) in CRC, where it shows markedly higher expression in metastatic CRC tissues compared to primary tumors. We further show that CAFs-induced LRG1 promotes CRC migration and invasion that is concomitant with EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) induction. In addition, this signaling axis has also been confirmed in the liver metastatic mouse model which displayed CAFs-induced LRG1 substantially accelerates metastasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CAFs-secreted IL-6 (interleukin-6) is responsible for LRG1 up-regulation in CRC, which occurs through a direct transactivation by STAT3 following JAK2 activation. In clinical CRC tumor samples, LRG1 expression was positively correlated with CAFs-specific marker, α-SMA, and a higher LRG1 expression predicted poor clinical outcomes especially distant metastasis free survival, supporting the role of LRG1 in CRC progression. Collectively, this study provided a novel insight into CAFs-mediated metastasis in CRC and indicated that therapeutic targeting of CAFs-mediated IL-6-STAT3-LRG1 axis might be a potential strategy to mitigate metastasis in CRC.",

Here, we sought to understand these potentially opposing functions by interrogating functional relationships between CAF subtypes, their mediators, desmoplasia and tumor growth in wide range of tumor types metastasizing to the liver, the most common organ site for metastasis. Depletion of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which represented main source of CAF in mice and patients in our study, or depletion of all CAF decreased tumor growth and mortality in desmoplastic colorectal and pancreatic metastasis, but not in non-desmoplastic metastatic tumors. Single cell RNA-sequencing in conjunction with CellPhoneDB ligand-receptor analysis, as well as studies in immune cell-depleted and HSC-selective knockout mice uncovered direct CAF-tumor interactions as tumor-promoting mechanism, mediated by myofibroblastic CAF (myCAF)-secreted hyaluronan and inflammatory CAF (iCAF)-secreted HGF. These effects were opposed by myCAF-expressed type-I collagen, which suppressed tumor growth by mechanically restraining tumor spread, overriding its own stiffness-induced mechanosignals. In summary, mechanical restriction by type-I collagen opposes the overall tumor-promoting effects of CAF, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for their dual functions in cancer. Therapeutic targeting of tumor-promoting CAF mediators while preserving type-I collagen may convert CAF from tumor-promoting to tumor-restricting.",

            "abstract": "Hyaluronan is made and extruded from cells to form a pericellular or extracellular matrix (ECM) and is present in virtually all tissues in the body. The size and form of hyaluronan present in tissues are indicative of a healthy or inflamed tissue, and the interactions of hyaluronan with immune cells can influence their response. Thus, in order to understand how inflammation is regulated, it is necessary to understand these interactions and their consequences. Although there is a large turnover of hyaluronan in our bodies, the large molecular mass form of hyaluronan predominates in healthy tissues. Upon tissue damage and/or infection, the ECM and hyaluronan are broken down and an inflammatory response ensues. As inflammation is resolved, the ECM is restored, and high molecular mass hyaluronan predominates again. Immune cells encounter hyaluronan in the tissues and lymphoid organs and respond differently to high and low molecular mass forms. Immune cells differ in their ability to bind hyaluronan and this can vary with the cell type and their activation state. For example, peritoneal macrophages do not bind soluble hyaluronan but can be induced to bind after exposure to inflammatory stimuli. Likewise, naïve T cells, which typically express low levels of the hyaluronan receptor, CD44, do not bind hyaluronan until they undergo antigen-stimulated T cell proliferation and upregulate CD44. Despite substantial knowledge of where and when immune cells bind hyaluronan, why immune cells bind hyaluronan remains a major outstanding question. Here, we review what is currently known about the interactions of hyaluronan with immune cells in both healthy and inflamed tissues and discuss how hyaluronan binding by immune cells influences the inflammatory response.",

Diagnosis of small tumors at an early stage or dysplastic premalignant lesions that can be surgically resected offers patients the best chances for survival and can increase 5-year survival rates from approximately 5% to 20%–30%, or even higher, at specialized treatment centers. The early stages of PC are usually asymptomatic, and the aggressive nature of this disease, in combination with our limited capability for early detection, contribute to the very low percentage of patients (approximately 20%) diagnosed with resectable disease. Large numbers of early diagnoses are due to incidental findings during abdominal imaging procedures.",

            "abstract": "Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, causing more than 700,000 deaths annually. Because of the wide landscape of genomic alterations and limited therapeutic success of targeting tumor cells, a recent focus has been on better understanding and possibly targeting the microenvironment in which liver tumors develop. A unique feature of liver cancer is its close association with liver fibrosis. More than 80% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) develop in fibrotic or cirrhotic livers, suggesting an important role of liver fibrosis in the premalignant environment (PME) of the liver. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), in contrast, is characterized by a strong desmoplasia that typically occurs in response to the tumor, suggesting a key role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and fibrosis in its tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we discuss the functional contributions of myofibroblasts, CAFs, and fibrosis to the development of HCC and CCA in the hepatic PME and TME, focusing on myofibroblast- and extracellular matrix-associated growth factors, fibrosis-associated immunosuppressive pathways, as well as mechanosensitive signaling cascades that are activated by increased tissue stiffness. Better understanding of the role of myofibroblasts in HCC and CCA development and progression may provide the basis to target these cells for tumor prevention or therapy.",

            "abstract": "Biomechanical and biochemical cues within a tissue collaborate across length scales to direct cell fate during development and are critical for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Loss of tensional homeostasis in a tissue not only accompanies malignancy but may also contribute to oncogenic transformation. High mechanical stress in solid tumors can impede drug delivery and may additionally drive tumor progression and promote metastasis. Mechanistically, biomechanical forces can drive tumor aggression by inducing a mesenchymal-like switch in transformed cells so that they attain tumor-initiating or stem-like cell properties. Given that cancer stem cells have been linked to metastasis and treatment resistance, this raises the intriguing possibility that the elevated tissue mechanics in tumors could promote their aggression by programming their phenotype toward that exhibited by a stem-like cell.Significance: Recent findings argue that mechanical stress and elevated mechanosignaling foster malignant transformation and metastasis. Prolonged corruption of tissue tension may drive tumor aggression by altering cell fate specification. Thus, strategies that could reduce tumor mechanics might comprise effective approaches to prevent the emergence of treatment-resilient metastatic cancers. Cancer Discov; 7(11); 1224-37. ©2017 AACR.",

            "abstract": "PURPOSE\nResection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) in selected patients has evolved as the standard of care during the last 20 years. In the absence of prospective randomized clinical trials, a survival benefit has been deduced relative to historical controls based on actuarial data. There is now sufficient follow-up on a significant number of patients to address the curative intent of resecting CLM.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRetrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed on patients who underwent resection of CLM from 1985 to 1994. Postoperative deaths were excluded. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was calculated from the time of hepatectomy using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 612 consecutive patients identified with 10-year follow-up. Median DSS was 44 months. There were 102 actual 10-year survivors. Ninety-nine (97%) of the 102 were disease free at last follow-up. Only one patient experienced a disease-specific death after 10 years of survival. In contrast, 34% of the 5-year survivors suffered a cancer-related death. Previously identified poor prognostic factors found among the 102 actual 10-year survivors included 7% synchronous disease, 36% disease-free interval less than 12 months, 25% bilobar metastases, 50% node-positive primary, 39% more than one metastasis, and 35% tumor size more than 5 cm.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients who survive 10 years appear to be cured of their disease, whereas approximately one third of actual 5-year survivors succumb to a cancer-related death. In well-selected patients, there is at least a one in six chance of cure after hepatectomy for CLM. The presence of poor prognostic factors does not preclude the possibility of long-term survival and cure.",

            "To determine the role of CAF-derived HGF, we crossed LratCre with Hgffl/fl mice (HgfΔHSC), achieving a 70%–90% reduction of Hgf in PDAC and CRC liver metastases while leaving HSC marker Lrat as well as ECM-modulating myCAF gene Col1a1 intact (Supplemental Figure 9C).",
            "Unexpectedly, Col1a1 deletion significantly increased metastatic tumor growth, as evidenced by increased liver-to-body weight ratio and tumor area in both PDAC (Pan02, KPCY) and CRC metastasis (CMT93), which was paralleled by increased proliferation (Figure 8C, Figure 9A, and Supplemental Figure 7C).",
            "To confirm CAF identity by a second approach in vivo, we next performed scRNA-Seq in CAF-enriched fractions of the desmoplastic PDAC (Pan02, KPCY) and CRC (CMT93) models (Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 2A).",
            "Moreover, our data demonstrate that the overiCAF mediator Hgf promotes PDAC and CRC metastatic tumor growth."

Vertebrates have also evolved integrins that can bind to collagens, resulting in the generation of higher tension and more efficient force transmission in the extracellular matrix. The stiffer environment provides an opportunity for the vertebrates to create new structures such as the stress fibers, new cell types such as endothelial cells, new developmental processes such as neural crest delamination, and new tissue organizations such as the blood–brain barrier. Molecular players found only in vertebrates allow the modification of conserved mechanisms as well as the design of novel strategies that can better serve the physiological needs of the vertebrates. These innovations collectively contribute to novel morphogenetic behaviors and unprecedented increases in the complexities of tissue mechanics and functions.",

        "abstract": "Background The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with other therapeutic strategies have shown exciting results in various malignancies, and ICIs have now become the gold standard for current cancer treatment. In several preclinical and clinical investigations, ablation coupled with immunotherapy has proved to be quite effective. Our previous studies have shown that ablation coupled with ICI is a potential anti-cancer regimen for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM). Furthermore, we have reported that following microwave ablation (MWA), the expression of LAG3 is up-regulated in tumor microenvironment (TME), indicating that LAG3 is implicated in the regulation of immunosuppressive immune response, and combination therapy of MWA and LAG3 blockade can serve as a promising therapeutic strategy against cancer. Methods The expression of LAG3 was investigated in this study utilizing a preclinical mouse model treated with MWA. Moreover, we monitored the tumor development and survival in mice to assess the anti-cancer effects of MWA alone or in combination with LAG3 blockade. Flow cytometry was also used to phenotype the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and CD8 + T cell effector molecules. We finally analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of infiltrating CD45 + immune cells in the tumors from the MWA alone and MWA combined with LAG3 blockade groups. Results After MWA, the expression of LAG3 was up-regulated on sub-populations of TILs, and introducing LAG3 blockade to MWA postponed tumor development and extended survival in the MC38 tumor model. Flow cytometry and scRNA-seq revealed that LAG3 blockade in combination with MWA markedly boosted the proliferation and the function of CD8 + TILs, leading to altered myeloid cells in the TME. Conclusion Combination therapy of LAG3 blockade and MWA was a unique therapeutic regimen for some solid tumors, and such combination therapy might reprogram the TME to an anti-tumor manner.",

            "abstract": "Minimally invasive therapies, such as microwave ablation (MWA), are widely used for the treatment of solid tumors. Previous studies suggest that MWA is feasible for the treatment of small breast cancer, and thermal ablation may induce adaptive antitumor immunity. However, the induced immune responses are mostly weak, and the immunomodulation effects of MWA in breast cancer are unclear. Immunostimulant OK-432 can induce tumor-specific T-cell responses and may augment the immunity induced by MWA. We treated 4T1 breast cancer bearing BALB/c mice with MWA, OK-432, MWA plus OK-432, or left without treatment. Survival time was evaluated with the Kaplan–Meyer method comparing survival curves by log-rank test. On day 25 after ablation, surviving mice received tumor rechallenge, and the rechallenged tumor volumes were calculated every 5 days. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the T-cell immune responses in ablated tissues and spleens. The tumor-specific immunity was assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot assays. Besides, the cytokine patterns were identified from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Microwave ablation plus OK-432 resulted in longer survival than single treatment and protect most surviving mice from tumor rechallenge. Both local and systemic T-cell responses were induced by MWA and were further enhanced by subsequent administration of OK-432. Moreover, the combination of MWA and OK-432 induced stronger tumor-specific immune responses than MWA alone. In addition, OK-432 and MWA synergistically promoted the production of Th1-type but not Th2-type cytokines, and polarized T-cell responses to Th1-dominant state. The T-cell immune responses were activated by MWA in breast cancer. Furthermore, the combination of MWA and OK-432 induced Th1-type response and elicited specific antitumor immunity.",

In cancer, immune checkpoint pathways are often activated to inhibit the nascent anti-tumor immune response. Immune checkpoint therapies act by blocking or stimulating these pathways and enhance the body’s immunological activity against tumors. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated molecule-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1), and programmed cell death ligand-1(PD-L1) are the most widely studied and recognized inhibitory checkpoint pathways. Drugs blocking these pathways are currently utilized for a wide variety of malignancies and have demonstrated durable clinical activities in a subset of cancer patients. This approach is rapidly extending beyond CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1. New inhibitory pathways are under investigation, and drugs blocking LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT, VISTA, or B7/H3 are being investigated. Furthermore, agonists of stimulatory checkpoint pathways such as OX40, ICOS, GITR, 4-1BB, CD40, or molecules targeting tumor microenvironment components like IDO or TLR are under investigation. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive review of immune checkpoint pathways involved in cancer immunotherapy, and discuss their mechanisms and the therapeutic interventions currently under investigation in phase I/II clinical trials. We also reviewed the limitations, toxicities, and challenges and outline the possible future research directions.",

Like CD4, LAG-3 ectodomain is composed of four Ig-like domains (D1-D4). Nothing is known about the LAG-3 regions or residues required to form a stable MHC class II binding site. In contrast to CD4, soluble LAG-3 molecules stably interact with MHC class II molecules expressed on the cell surface. In addition, the first two N-terminal domains of soluble LAG-3 (D1 and D2) molecules, alone, are capable of binding MHC class II. From a LAG-3 model structure, we designed mutants and tested their ability to bind MHC class II molecules in an intercellular adhesion assay. We found residues on the membrane-distal, CDR1-2-containing top face of D1 that are essential for either binding or repulsing MHC class II proteins. Most of these residues are clustered at the base of a large extra-loop structure that is a hallmark of the LAG-3 D1 Ig-like domain. In addition, as for CD4, oligomerization of LAG-3 on the cell surface may be required to form a stable MHC binding site because mutation of three residues in the ABED beta-strands containing side of D1 results in a dominant negative effect (i.e., binding inhibition of coexpressed wild-type LAG-3).",

The impact of RFA on the tumor immune microenvironment on distant tumors after RFA treatment is still unclear. In this study, by using syngeneic tumor models and single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor sequencing, we have investigated the alterations of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in distant non-RFA tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified six distinct lymphoid clusters, five distinct monocyte/macrophage clusters, three dendritic cells clusters, and one cluster of neutrophils. We found that RFA treatment reduced the proportions of immunosuppressive cells including regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages and tumor-associated neutrophils, whereas increased the percentages of functional T cells in distant non-RFA tumors. Moreover, RFA treatment also altered gene expressions in single-cell level in each cell cluster. By using pseudo-time analysis, we have described the biological processes of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and monocytes/macrophages based on the transcriptional profiles. In addition, the immune checkpoints including PD-1 and LAG3 were upregulated in the T cells in distant non-RFA tumors after RFA treatment. In conclusion, our data indicate that RFA treatment induced remodeling of tumor immune microenvironment in distant non-RFA tumors in pancreatic cancer mouse model and suggest that combining RFA with immune checkpoint inhibitors may be an effective treatment approach.",

            "abstract": "This article provides an overview of imaging assessment of ablated pancreatic cancer. Only studies reporting radiological assessment on pancreatic ablated cancer were retained. We found 16 clinical studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Radiofrequency ablation and irreversible electroporation have become established treatment modalities because of their efficacy, low complication rates, and availability. Microwave Ablation (MWA) has several advantages over radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which may make it more attractive to treat pancreatic cancer. Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a very interesting emerging technique, characterized by low complication rate and safety profile. According to the literature, the assessment of the effectiveness of ablative therapies is difficult by means of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria that are not suitable to evaluate the treatment response considering that are related to technique used, the timing of reassessment, and the imaging procedure being used to evaluate the efficacy. RFA causes various appearances on imaging in the ablated zone, correlating to the different effects, such as interstitial edema, hemorrhage, carbonization, necrosis, and fibrosis. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) causes the creation of pores within the cell membrane causing cell death. Experimental studies showed that Diffusion Weigthed Imaging (DWI) extracted parameters could be used to detect therapy effects. No data about functional assessment post MWA is available in literature. Morphologic data extracted by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) do not allow to differentiate partial, complete, or incomplete response after ECT conversely to functional parameters, obtained with Position Emission Tomography (PET), MRI, and CT.",

The combination of relatlimab, a LAG-3-blocking antibody, and nivolumab, a PD-1-blocking antibody, has been shown to be safe and to have antitumor activity in patients with previously treated melanoma, but the safety and activity in patients with previously untreated melanoma need investigation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this phase 2-3, global, double-blind, randomized trial, we evaluated relatlimab and nivolumab as a fixed-dose combination as compared with nivolumab alone when administered intravenously every 4 weeks to patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median progression-free survival was 10.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.4 to 15.7) with relatlimab-nivolumab as compared with 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.4 to 5.6) with nivolumab (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.92]; P = 0.006 by the log-rank test). Progression-free survival at 12 months was 47.7% (95% CI, 41.8 to 53.2) with relatlimab-nivolumab as compared with 36.0% (95% CI, 30.5 to 41.6) with nivolumab. Progression-free survival across key subgroups favored relatlimab-nivolumab over nivolumab. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 18.9% of patients in the relatlimab-nivolumab group and in 9.7% of patients in the nivolumab group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe inhibition of two immune checkpoints, LAG-3 and PD-1, provided a greater benefit with regard to progression-free survival than inhibition of PD-1 alone in patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma. Relatlimab and nivolumab in combination showed no new safety signals. (Funded by Bristol Myers Squibb; RELATIVITY-047 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03470922.).",

        "title": "Upregulation of APOC1 Promotes Colorectal Cancer Progression and Serves as a Potential Therapeutic Target Based on Bioinformatics Analysis",
        "abstract": "Background Approximately 10% of cancer patients worldwide have colorectal cancer (CRC), a prevalent gastrointestinal malignancy with substantial mortality and morbidity. The purpose of this work was to investigate the APOC1 gene's expression patterns in the CRC tumor microenvironment and, using the findings from bioinformatics, to assess the biological function of APOC1 in the development of CRC. Methods The TCGA portal was employed in this investigation to find APOC1 expression in CRC. Its correlation with other genes and clinicopathological data was examined using the UALCAN database. To validate APOC1's cellular location, the Human Protein was employed. In order to forecast the relationship between APOC1 expression and prognosis in CRC patients, the Kaplan–Meier plotter database was used. TISIDB was also employed to evaluate the connection between immune responses and APOC1 expression in CRC. The interactions of APOC1 with other proteins were predicted using STRING. In order to understand the factors that contribute to liver metastasis from CRC, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was done on one patient who had the disease. This procedure included sampling preoperative blood and the main colorectal cancer tissues, surrounding colorectal cancer normal tissues, liver metastatic cancer tissues, and normal liver tissues. Finally, an in vitro knockdown method was used to assess how APOC1 expression in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) affected CRC cancer cell growth and migration. Results When compared to paracancerous tissues, APOC1 expression was considerably higher in CRC tissues. The clinicopathological stage and the prognosis of CRC patients had a positive correlation with APOC1 upregulation and a negative correlation, respectively. APOC1 proteins are mostly found in cell cytosols where they may interact with APOE, RAB42, and TREM2. APOC1 was also discovered to have a substantial relationship with immunoinhibitors (CD274, IDO1, and IL10) and immunostimulators (PVR, CD86, and ICOS). According to the results of scRNA-seq, we found that TAMs of CRC tissues had considerably more APOC1 than other cell groups. The proliferation and migration of CRC cells were impeded in vitro by APOC1 knockdown in TAMs. Conclusion Based on scRNA-seq research, the current study shows that APOC1 was overexpressed in TAMs from CRC tissues. By inhibiting APOC1 in TAMs, CRC progression was reduced in vitro, offering a new tactic and giving CRC patients fresh hope.",

        "abstract": "Background Combination immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has shown great success in the treatment of many types of cancers and has become the mainstream in the comprehensive treatment of cancers. Ablation in combination with immunotherapy has achieved tremendous efficacy in some preclinical and clinical studies. To date, our team proved that ablation in combination with ICIs was a promising antitumor therapeutic strategy for the liver metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Moreover, we found that the expression of T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT) expression was up-regulated after microwave ablation (MWA), indicating that TIGIT was involved in immunosuppression, and the combination of MWA and TIGIT blockade represented a potential clinical treatment strategy. Methods In the present study, we examined the expression of TIGIT using a preclinical mouse model treated with MWA. Moreover, we evaluated the antitumor functions of MWA alone or in combination with TIGIT blockade by monitoring tumor growth and survival of the mice. Besides, we also detected the numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and effector molecules of CD8+ T cells using flow cytometry. Finally, we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the MWA and MWA plus anti-TIGIT groups. Results The expression of TIGIT in various immune cells was up-regulated after MWA, and the addition of TIGIT blockade to MWA prolonged survival and delayed tumor growth in the MC38 tumor model. Taken together, our findings showed that TIGIT blockade in combination with MWA significantly promoted the expansion and functions of CD8+ TILs and reshaped myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) using flow cytometry and scRNA-seq analysis. Conclusions TIGIT blockade in combination with MWA was a novel treatment strategy for the liver metastasis of CRC, and this combination therapy could reprogram the TME toward an antitumor environment.",

            "abstract": "Purpose: T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domain (TIGIT) blockade could represent an alternative therapeutic option to release the immune response in patients with multiple myeloma. Here we analyzed the expression of TIGIT and its ligands poliovirus receptor (PVR) and nectin-2 in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with monoclonal gammopathies and the efficacy of TIGIT blockade activating antimyeloma immunity. Experimental Design: Expression levels of TIGIT and its ligands were characterized by flow cytometry and ELISA. TIGIT blockade was analyzed in in vitro functional assays with peripheral T cells. BM cells were studied with NanoString technology, real-time PCR, and ex vivo patient BM cell models. Results: TIGIT and its ligands are highly expressed in the BM of patients with multiple myeloma, suggesting that may play a role in restraining immune activation. TIGIT blockade depleted FoxP3+ Tregs while increasing proliferation of IFNγ-producing CD4+ T cells from patients with multiple myeloma. PVR ligation inhibited CD8+ T-cell signaling and cell proliferation which could be overcome with anti-TIGIT mAb. However, BM cells showed a remarkable heterogeneity in immune signature. Accordingly, functional ex vivo BM assays revealed that only some patients respond to checkpoint blockade. Thus, response to TIGIT blockade correlated with low frequency of TIGIT+ cells and high nectin-2 expression on malignant plasma cells. Conclusions: TIGIT blockade efficiently reinvigorated peripheral T cells from patients with multiple myeloma. However, in the BM, the efficacy of blocking anti-TIGIT mAb to achieve tumor cell death may depend on the expression of TIGIT and nectin-2, becoming potential predictive biomarkers for identifying patients who may benefit from TIGIT blockade.",

The impact of RFA on the tumor immune microenvironment on distant tumors after RFA treatment is still unclear. In this study, by using syngeneic tumor models and single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor sequencing, we have investigated the alterations of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in distant non-RFA tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified six distinct lymphoid clusters, five distinct monocyte/macrophage clusters, three dendritic cells clusters, and one cluster of neutrophils. We found that RFA treatment reduced the proportions of immunosuppressive cells including regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages and tumor-associated neutrophils, whereas increased the percentages of functional T cells in distant non-RFA tumors. Moreover, RFA treatment also altered gene expressions in single-cell level in each cell cluster. By using pseudo-time analysis, we have described the biological processes of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and monocytes/macrophages based on the transcriptional profiles. In addition, the immune checkpoints including PD-1 and LAG3 were upregulated in the T cells in distant non-RFA tumors after RFA treatment. In conclusion, our data indicate that RFA treatment induced remodeling of tumor immune microenvironment in distant non-RFA tumors in pancreatic cancer mouse model and suggest that combining RFA with immune checkpoint inhibitors may be an effective treatment approach.",

        "title": "Vascular Heterogeneity With a Special Focus on the Hepatic Microenvironment",
        "abstract": "Utilizing single-cell sequencing, recent studies were able to analyze at a greater resolution the heterogeneity of the vasculature and its complex composition in different tissues. Differing subpopulations have been detected, distinguishable only by their transcriptome. Designed to provide further insight into the heterogeneity of the functional vascular tissue, endothelial cells have been the main target of those studies. This review aims to present a synopsis of the variability of the different vascular beds, their endothelial variety, and the supporting cells that allow the vessels to serve their various purposes. Firstly, we are going to chart vascular tissue heterogeneity on a cellular level, describing endothelial diversity as well as stromal microenvironmental variety and interaction in a physiological setting. Secondly, we will summarize the current knowledge of pathological vessel formation in the context of cancer. Conventional anti-tumor therapeutic targets as well as anti-angiogenetic therapy is frequently limited by poor response of the tumor tissue. Reasons for moderate response and resistance to treatment can be found through different drivers of angiogenesis, different mechanisms of blood supply, but also in poorly understood tissue diversity. Based on this, we are comparing how pathologies alter the normal structure of vascular tissues highlighting the involved mechanisms. Lastly, illustrating the concept above, we will focus on the hepatic microenvironment, an organ of frequent metastatic spreading (e.g., from colorectal, breast, and lung cancers). We will address how the hepatic vasculature usually develops and subsequently we will describe how common liver metastases vary in their vasculature and the way they supply themselves (e.g., angiogenesis versus vessel co-option).",

Many laboratories are now engaged in this pursuit. Some are studying angiogenesis that occurs in physiological situations, whereas others are interested in angiogenesis that dominates pathological conditions. These efforts have led to (1) the development of bioassays for angiogenesis; (2) the partial purification and, in one case, the complete purification of angiogenic factors from neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells; (3) the development of new polymer technology for the sustained release of these factors and other macromolecules in vivo; (4) the cloning and long-term culture of capillary endothelial cells; (5) the demonstration of the role of nonendothelial cells, such as mast cells in modulating angiogenesis; (6) the discovery of angiogenesis inhibitors; and (7) the demonstration that certain animal tumors will regress when angiogenesis is inhibited. The effects of angiogenesis inhibitors provide perhaps the most compelling evidence for the role of angiogenesis in tumor growth. It is conceivable that the original effort to understand the role of angiogenesis in tumor growth will also lead to the use of angiogenesis inhibitors as a new class of pharmacologic agents in a variety of non-neoplastic diseases such as arthritis, psoriasis, and ocular neovascularization. However, much work remains to be done before it will be possible to understand (1) the regulatory systems that govern capillary density in normal tissues; (2) the factors that maintain the viability of microvascular endothelium; (3) the development of the vascular system itself; and (4) the mechanism by which vascular regression occurs, both in the embryo and in the postnatal organism. A knowledge of the mechanisms which underlie these normal processes may help to enlarge our comprehension of tumor angiogenesis.",

Notably, instead of through the induction of angiogenesis, tumor vascularization can occur through the nonangiogenic mechanism of vessel co-option. Here we show that vessel co-option is associated with a poor response to the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Moreover, we find that vessel co-option is also prevalent in human breast cancer liver metastases, a setting in which results with anti-angiogenic therapy have been disappointing. In preclinical mechanistic studies, we found that cancer cell motility mediated by the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) is required for vessel co-option in liver metastases in vivo and that, in this setting, combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option is more effective than the inhibition of angiogenesis alone. Vessel co-option is therefore a clinically relevant mechanism of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy and combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option might be a warranted therapeutic strategy.",

            "abstract": "The critical role of angiogenesis in promoting tumor growth and metastasis is strongly established. However, tumors show considerable variation in angiogenic characteristics and in their sensitivity to antiangiogenic therapy. Tumor angiogenesis involves not only cancer cells but also various tumor-associated leukocytes (TALs) and stromal cells. TALs produce chemokines, cytokines, proteases, structural proteins, and microvescicles. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory chemokines are not only major proangiogenic factors but are also immune modulators, which increase angiogenesis and lead to immune suppression. In our review, we discuss the regulation of angiogenesis by innate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, specific features, and roles of major players: macrophages, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor and dendritic cells, mast cells, γδT cells, innate lymphoid cells, and natural killer cells. Anti-VEGF or anti-inflammatory drugs could balance an immunosuppressive microenvironment to an immune permissive one. Anti-VEGF as well as anti-inflammatory drugs could therefore represent partners for combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors, enhancing the effects of immune therapy.",

            "abstract": "Anti-angiogenic therapy is one of the promising strategies for many types of solid cancers. Bevacizumab (Avastin), a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A, was approved for the first time as an anti-angiogenic drug for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004. In addition, the other VEGF pathway inhibitors including small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib), a soluble VEGF decoy receptor (aflibercept), and a humanized monoclonal antibody of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (ramucirumab) have been approved for cancer therapy. Although many types of VEGF pathway inhibitors can improve survival in most cancer patients, some patients have little or no beneficial effect from them. The primary or acquired resistance towards many oncological drugs, including anti-VEGF inhibitors, is a common problem in cancer treatment. This review summarizes the proposed alternative mechanisms of angiogenesis other than the VEGF pathway. These mechanisms are involved in the development of resistance to anti-VEGF therapies in cancer patients.",

The HGPs are defined owing to the distinct interface between the cancer cells and the adjacent normal liver parenchyma that is present in each pattern and can be scored from standard haematoxylin-and-eosin-stained (H&E) tissue sections. The current study provides consensus guidelines for scoring these HGPs.Methods:Guidelines for defining the HGPs were established by a large international team. To assess the validity of these guidelines, 12 independent observers scored a set of 159 liver metastases and interobserver variability was measured. In an independent cohort of 374 patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRCLM), the impact of HGPs on overall survival after hepatectomy was determined.Results:Good-to-excellent correlations (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.5) with the gold standard were obtained for the assessment of the replacement HGP and desmoplastic HGP. Overall survival was significantly superior in the desmoplastic HGP subgroup compared with the replacement or pushing HGP subgroup (P=0.006).Conclusions:The current guidelines allow for reproducible determination of liver metastasis HGPs. As HGPs impact overall survival after surgery for CRCLM, they may serve as a novel biomarker for individualised therapies.",

            "abstract": "Although tissue engineering promises to replace or restore lost function to nearly every tissue in the body, successful applications are currently limited to tissue less than 2 mm in thickness. in vivo capillary networks deliver oxygen and nutrients to thicker (> 2 mm) tissues, suggesting that introduction of a preformed in vitro vascular network may be a useful strategy for engineered tissues. This article describes a system for generating capillary-like networks within a thick fibrin matrix. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, growing on the surface of microcarrier beads, were embedded in fibrin gels a known distance (Delta = 1.8-4.5 mm) from a monolayer of human dermal fibroblasts. The distance of the growth medium, which contained vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, from the beads, C, was varied from 2.7 to 7.2 mm. Capillaries with visible lumens sprouted in 2-3 days, reaching lengths that exceeded 500 microm within 6-8 days. On day 7, capillary network formation was largely independent of C; however, a strong inverse correlation with Delta was observed, with the maximum network formation at Delta = 1.8 mm. Surprisingly, the thickness of the gel was not a limiting factor for oxygen diffusion as these tissue constructs retained a relatively high oxygen tension of > 125 mmHg. We conclude that diffusion of oxygen in vitro is not limiting, allowing the development of tissue constructs on the order of centimeters in thickness. In addition, diffusion of fibroblast-derived soluble mediators is necessary for stable capillary formation, but is significantly impeded relative to that of nutrients present in the medium.",

Evidence suggests that tumor vasculature expresses unique markers that distinguish it from normal vasculature. Our efforts focused on the molecular characterization of endothelial cells (EC) in the search for selective markers of tumor vasculature that might be helpful for the development of effective therapeutic approaches. Results: We investigated by microarray analysis the gene expression profiles of EC purified and cultured from tumor (ovarian carcinoma [HOC-EC]) and normal (human adrenal gland [HA-EC]) tissue specimens. We found distinct transcriptional features characterizing the EC of different origin, and identified 158 transcripts highly expressed by HOC-EC. We analyzed four of these genes, ADAM23, FAP, GPNMB and PRSS3, which were not previously known to be expressed by endothelium. In vitro experiments confirmed the higher expression of the selected genes in tumor-derived endothelium with no expression in tumor cells. In vivo investigation by in situ hybridization established that ADAM23, GPNMB and PRSS3 expression is localized on blood vessels of human cancer specimens. target Three HOC-EC and two HA-EC populations were investigated by Affymetrix GeneChip ® Human Genome U95A Arrays. This list of highly expressed endothelial genes was extracted from the microarray results by keywords search within the complete probeset list annotated using SOURCE batch search (see Methods for details).",

Influx kinetics of hepatocytes into DNA synthesis as well as cell cycle phases vary in different parts of the liver lobule between the afferent and efferent vascular poles. Heterogeneity of the proliferative response and size limitations on cell cycle compartments appear to be intimately related to the actual functional state of the individual liver cell. Modifications of liver cell functions result in variations of the proliferative activity. Phenobarbital-induced hypertrophy of hepatocytes reveals a permissive action on G1- S influx. Selective destruction of the subpopulations, by allyl formate, leads to a new functional determination of the residual liver and to a change in proliferative compartments. Maximum modulation of cell cycle compartments is obtained by hydroxyurea-induced synchronization of hepatocytes after partial liver resection. During hydroxyurea treatment, the regenerating liver shows a pronounced cellular hypertrophy. After release from hydroxyurea block, cells embark on DNA synthesis simultaneously. The DNA synthesizing compartment comprises almost the entire liver cell population. Heptotrophic factors might play a part in regulating or modifying hepatocellular function and proliferative response after cell loss.",

As germ cells develop, they traverse the seminiferous epithelium, a process that involves restructuring of Sertoli-germ cell junctions, as well as Sertoli-Sertoli cell junctions at the blood-testis barrier. The blood-testis barrier, one of the tightest tissue barriers in the mammalian body, divides the seminiferous epithelium into 2 compartments, basal and adluminal. The blood-testis barrier is different from most other tissue barriers in that it is not only comprised of tight junctions. Instead, tight junctions coexist and cofunction with ectoplasmic specializations, desmosomes, and gap junctions to create a unique microenvironment for the completion of meiosis and the subsequent development of spermatids into spermatozoa via spermiogenesis. Studies from the past decade or so have identified the key structural, scaffolding, and signaling proteins of the blood-testis barrier. More recent studies have defined the regulatory mechanisms that underlie blood-testis barrier function. We review here the biology and regulation of the mammalian blood-testis barrier and highlight research areas that should be expanded in future studies.",

To minimize postoperative liver dysfunction, a portal venous branch was embolized before surgery to induce atrophy of the lobe to be resected and hypertrophy of the contralateral lobe in 14 patients with hilar bile duct carcinoma. Bile was drained before surgery in 11 patients with jaundice. Portal embolization did not produce major side effects, and moderate increases of serum transaminase activity or bilirubin returned to baseline values within 1 week. Hepatectomy with bile duct resection and lymphadenectomy was performed 6 to 41 days after embolization, at which time the embolized lobe was atrophied in 12 of the patients. Extended right or left lobectomy or left trisegmentectomy (10, 3, and 1 cases, respectively) with biliointestinal reconstruction was performed. One patient with jaundice and suppurative cholangitis died 30 days after hepatectomy. Another patient died 3 months after surgery of aggravated hepatitis.

PC cells express the onco-fetal RTK ROR1, absent on most normal post-partem cells. ROR1 is involved in proliferation, survival, EMT and metastasis of tumor cells in various malignancies. A small molecule inhibitor (KAN0439834) (530 Da) targeting the TK domain of ROR1 was developed and the activity in ROR1 expressing human PC cell lines (n = 8) evaluated. The effects were compared to a murine mAb against the external part of ROR1, gemcitabine, erlotinib and ibrutinib. KAN0439834 induced significant apoptosis of the tumor cells. EC50 values for KAN0439834 varied between 250–650 nM depending on the cell line. The corresponding values for erlotinib and ibrutinib were 10–40 folds higher. KAN0439834 was much more effective in inducing tumor cell death than the ROR1 mAb although both inhibited ROR1 phosphorylation and downstream non-canonical Wnt pathway molecules. Combination of KAN0439834 with erlotinib or ibrutinib had significant additive effects on tumor cell death. A first-in-class small molecule ROR1 inhibitor (KAN0439834) showed promising in vitro activity against a number of human PC cell lines. Interesting is the additive effects of erlotinib and ibrutinib which warrants further studies as both these agents are in clinical trials for pancreatic carcinoma.",

Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics with lineage tracing to examine VSMC heterogeneity in healthy mouse vessels. The transcriptional profiles of single VSMCs consistently reflect their region-specific developmental history and show heterogeneous expression of vascular disease-associated genes involved in inflammation, adhesion and migration. We detect a rare population of VSMC-lineage cells that express the multipotent progenitor marker Sca1, progressively downregulate contractile VSMC genes and upregulate genes associated with VSMC response to inflammation and growth factors. We find that Sca1 upregulation is a hallmark of VSMCs undergoing phenotypic switching in vitro and in vivo, and reveal an equivalent population of Sca1-positive VSMC-lineage cells in atherosclerotic plaques. Together, our analyses identify disease-relevant transcriptional signatures in VSMC-lineage cells in healthy blood vessels, with implications for disease susceptibility, diagnosis and prevention. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) accumulation is associated with cardiovascular disease. Here, the authors combine single-cell RNA sequencing with lineage labelling to profile VSMC heterogeneity in healthy mice. They show that upregulation of Sca1 in a rare VSMC subpopulation marks a cell phenotype that is prevalent in disease.",

This study aims to assess the reliability and replicability of this histological biomarker. Within and between metastasis HGP concordance was analysed in patients who underwent surgery for CRLM. An independent cohort was used for external validation. Within metastasis concordance was assessed in CRLM with ≥ 2 tissue blocks. Similarly, concordance amongst multiple metastases was determined in patients with ≥ 2 resected CRLM. Diagnostic accuracy [expressed in area under the curve (AUC)] was compared by number of blocks and number of metastases scored. Interobserver agreement (Cohen’s k) compared to the gold standard was determined for a pathologist and a PhD candidate without experience in HGP assessment after one and two training sessions. Both the within (95%, n = 825) and the between metastasis (90%, n = 363) HGP concordance was high. These results could be replicated in the external validation cohort with a within and between metastasis concordance of 97% and 94%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy improved when scoring 2 versus 1 blocks(s) or CRLM (AUC = 95.9 vs. 97.7 [p = 0.039] and AUC = 96.5 vs. 93.3 [p = 0.026], respectively), but not when scoring 3 versus 2 blocks or CRLM (both p > 0.2). After two training sessions the interobserver agreement for both the pathologist and the PhD candidate were excellent (k = 0.953 and k = 0.951, respectively). The histopathological growth patterns of colorectal liver metastasis exhibit little heterogeneity and can be determined with a high diagnostic accuracy, making them a reliable and replicable histological biomarker.",

Both of these processes depend on the detection of environmental guidance cues by endothelial cells. A specialized subtype of endothelial cell known as the tip cell is thought to be involved in the detection and response to these cues, but the molecular signaling pathways used by tip cells to mediate tissue vascularization remain largely uncharacterized. To identify genes critical to tip cell function, we have developed a method to isolate them using laser capture microdissection, permitting comparison of RNA extracted from endothelial tip cells with that of endothelial stalk cells using microarray analysis. Genes enriched in tip cells include ESM-1, angiopoietin-2, and SLP-76. CXCR4, a receptor for the chemokine stromal-cell derived factor-1, was also identified as a tip cell-enriched gene, and we provide evidence for a novel role for this receptor in mediating tip cell morphology and vascular patterning in the neonatal retina.",
