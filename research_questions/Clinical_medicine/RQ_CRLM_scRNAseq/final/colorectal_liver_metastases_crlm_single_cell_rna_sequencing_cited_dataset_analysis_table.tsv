CRLM single cell RNA sequencing	https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.72853	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1631-3	The CRLM single cell RNA sequencing dataset is used to compare the phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in colorectal liver metastases with an atlas of healthy and cirrhotic liver cell types. This involves analyzing transcriptomic profiles and cellular mechanisms to understand the differences and similarities between these cell types, providing insights into the molecular and cellular dynamics of CRLM.
single human cells from healthy and cirrhotic human liver	https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.72853	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1631-3	The dataset of single human cells from healthy and cirrhotic human liver is used to profile the transcriptomes of over 100,000 cells, providing molecular definitions for non-parenchymal cell types. This enables researchers to understand the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRC-LM). The dataset's large scale and detailed molecular characterization facilitate insights into cellular heterogeneity and disease mechanisms.
The Cancer Genome Atlas	https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20191847	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.003	The Cancer Genome Atlas is used to analyze the association between C1QA+ TAM-like macrophage gene signatures and patient prognosis in colorectal liver metastases. Researchers employ gene expression data and clinical outcomes from the dataset to identify prognostic biomarkers and understand immune cell dynamics in cancer progression. This enables more precise risk stratification and therapeutic targeting in clinical settings.
single-cell atlas of colorectal liver metastases	https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.72853	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1631-3	The single-cell atlas of colorectal liver metastases is used to profile the transcriptomes of over 100,000 single human cells in both healthy and cirrhotic livers. This dataset identifies specific cell populations and their roles in fibrosis, providing insights relevant to understanding the cellular mechanisms of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). The high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing data enable researchers to dissect the complex cellular interactions and identify potential therapeutic targets in CRLM.
single-cell transcriptome atlas	https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.72853	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1631-3	The 'single-cell transcriptome atlas' dataset is mentioned in the citation context but lacks detailed descriptions of its usage, methodology, research questions, or specific applications. Therefore, based on the provided information, there is insufficient evidence to describe how this dataset is actually used in research.
