Their findings showed that statistical learning ability was a significant predictor of Esperanto pattern learning but not of working memory capacity. Extending this finding, they also found a significant relationship between statistical learning ability and the learning of the patterns of English double object constructions. They concluded that scores on the artificial grammar learning task were predictive of individual differences in the L2 learners’ pattern learning in Esperanto and English. These findings, which contradict those of Robinson (2005), suggest the need for further investigation of the relationship between statistical learning ability and individual differences in second/foreign language learning. The inconsistent findings of these previous studies could be due to the limitations of using offline measures across different modalities of AGL tasks (e.g., the auditory AGL task in McDonough & Trofimovich, 2016 vs. the visual AGL task in Robinson, 2005; Reber et al., 1991), which might obscure a correlation between statistical learning ability, as assessed through test scores in the AGL tasks, and L2 learning performance. Siegelman, Bogaerts, and Frost (2016) pointed out that offline test scores used to assess the final learning stage in an AGL task do not provide information on the participants’ implicit learning of statistical regularities across time, and furthermore, that the previous studies administered their offline tests only after the learning phase (i.",

Similarly, language acquisition research has conceptualized this ability as the ability to learn language implicitly, meaning without explicit instruction. Implicit learning is defined as the ability to be “automatic, associative, nonconscious, and unintentional” (Kaufman et al., 2010, p. 321). There seems to be a common consensus that statistical learning is a basic cognitive mechanism, which, as an instance of implicit learning, may be related to a mechanism involved in language acquisition and processing. Without intending to suggest that statistical learning and implicit learning are identical, this study follows Pacton and Perruchet (2008) and Conway and Christiansen (2006) in “consider[ing] implicit learning and statistical learning to refer to the same underlying phenomenon: inducing structure from input following exposure to multiple exemplars” (p.",
