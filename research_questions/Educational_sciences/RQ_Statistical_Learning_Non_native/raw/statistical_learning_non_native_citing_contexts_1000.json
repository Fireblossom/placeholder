        "title": "RQ1: Can older adults learn non-native words from cross-situational statistical learning?",
        "abstract": "Statistical learning, i.e. our ability to track and learn from distributional information in the environment, plays a fundamental role in language acquisition, yet little research has investigated this process in older language learners. In the present study, we address this gap by comparing the cross-situational learning of foreign words in younger and older adults. We also tested whether learning was affected by previous experience with multiple languages. We found that both age groups successfully learned the novel words after a short exposure period, confirming that statistical learning ability is preserved in late adulthood. However, the two groups differed in their learning trajectories, with the younger group outperforming the older group during the later stages of learning. Previous language experience did not predict learning outcomes. Our findings suggest that implicit language learning could be leveraged as a targeted intervention to help build or maintain resilience to age-related cognitive decline.",

Unlike the usual repeating pattern, the sequences alternated between events from a repeating pattern and those determined randomly. The results indicated that no one was able to describe the regularity, but with practice every individual in all 3 age groups (including old old) became faster, more accurate, or both, on pattern trials than on random trials. Although this indicates that adults of all ages are able to learn second-order statistical dependencies in a sequence, age-related deficits were obtained in the magnitude of pattern learning. There were also age differences in what was learned, with only younger people revealing sensitivity to higher order statistical dependencies in the sequence. In addition, whereas younger people revealed evidence of their pattern learning in a subsequent conceptually driven production test, young-old and old-old people did not.",

            "In the test phase, Bulgarelli and colleagues observed that older adults (mean age 72) could rapidly learn the word-referent mappings, even in highly ambiguous conditions when four words and four pictures were presented in each learning trial.",

We aim to further understand older adults’ statistical learning abilities using a cross-situational statistical learning paradigm in which learners map novel words to novel objects. In Experiment 1, we manipulated task difficulty and found an overall age deficit but no interaction between age and difficulty. In Experiment 2, after extended practice with a first set of object-word mappings, learners could remap a subset of previously learned words to novel objects. Based on hyper-binding, older adults might be more willing to remap previously learned words to novel objects. However, despite overall poorer learning, older adults were actually less likely to remap. Even though older adults may have an associative memory deficit, learned associations are not more weakly bound for older relative to younger adults.",

            "abstract": "The retrogenesis hypothesis proposes that the order of breakdown of cognitive abilities in older adults is the reverse of the developmental order of children. Declarative and procedural memory systems, however, have been empirically understudied regarding this issue. The current study aimed to investigate whether retrogenesis occurs in the developmental and decline order of the declarative and procedural memory systems. Besides, we further investigated whether retrogenesis occurs in declarative memory, which was tested through the recognition of familiar and unfamiliar items. Both questions were investigated by looking at 28 Chinese younger adults and 27 cognitively healthy Chinese older adults. The recognition memory task and the Serial Reaction Time Task were administered on two consecutive days in order to measure their declarative and procedural memory, respectively. The results showed older adults performed significantly worse than younger adults for both tasks on both days, suggesting a decline in both declarative and procedural memory. Moreover, older adults exhibited relatively preserved declarative memory compared to procedural memory. This does not follow the expectations of the retrogenesis hypothesis. However, older adults demonstrated superior performance and a steeper rate of forgetting for recognizing familiar items than unfamiliar items. This reverses the developmental order of different patterns in the declarative memory system. Overall, we conclude that retrogenesis occurs in the declarative memory system, while does not in the decline order of the two memory systems; this understanding can better help inform our broader understanding of memory aging.",

We used statistical learning (SL) experiments to compare processing of suffixed and prefixed sequences on linguistic and non-linguistic material. SL is not speech-specific, and we observed the suffixing preference only on linguistic material, suggesting its language-specific origin. Moreover, morphological properties of native languages (existence of grammatical prefixes) modulate suffixing preferences in SL experiments only on linguistic material, suggesting limited cross-domain transfer.",

            "abstract": "Although aphasia is often characterized as a selective impairment in language function, left hemisphere lesions may cause impairments in semantic processing of auditory information, not only in verbal but also in nonverbal domains. We assessed the 'online' relationship between verbal and nonverbal auditory processing by examining the ability of 30 left hemisphere-damaged aphasic patients to match environmental sounds and linguistic phrases to corresponding pictures. The verbal and nonverbal task components were matched carefully through a norming study; 21 age-matched controls and five right hemisphere-damaged patients were also tested to provide further reference points. We found that, while the aphasic groups were impaired relative to normal controls, they were impaired to the same extent in both domains, with accuracy and reaction time for verbal and nonverbal trials revealing unusually high correlations (r = 0.74 for accuracy, r = 0.95 for reaction time). Severely aphasic patients tended to perform worse in both domains, but lesion size did not correlate with performance. Lesion overlay analysis indicated that damage to posterior regions in the left middle and superior temporal gyri and to the inferior parietal lobe was a predictor of deficits in processing for both speech and environmental sounds. The lesion mapping and further statistical assessments reliably revealed a posterior superior temporal region (Wernicke's area, traditionally considered a language-specific region) as being differentially more important for processing nonverbal sounds compared with verbal sounds. These results suggest that, in most cases, processing of meaningful verbal and nonverbal auditory information break down together in stroke and that subsequent recovery of function applies to both domains. This suggests that language shares neural resources with those used for processing information in other domains.",

However, before we look to the brain to see what areas are associated with language processing phenomena, it is necessary to have good psychological theories of the relevant behavioral phenomena. Recent results have suggested that constructing an interpretation for a sentence involves the moment-by-moment integration of a variety of different information sources, constrained by the available computational resources (see, e.g., Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982; MacDonald, Pearlmutter, and Seidenberg 1994; Trueswell, Tanenhaus, and Garnsey 1994; Trueswell1996; Tyler and MarslenWilson 1977; McClelland, St. John, and Taraban 1989; Pearlmutter and MacDonald 1992; Crain and Steedman 1985; Altmann and Steedman, 1988; Ni , Crain, and Shankweiler 1996; see Gibson and Pearlmutter 1998 and Tanenhaus and Trueswell 1995 for summaries). This chapter presents evidence for one theory of resource use in sentence co\"mprehension: the dependency locality theory (DLT ). If the evidence for a theory such as this one accumulates, it will then make sense to look for neural correlates of the theory (see Kaan et ale 1998; Harris 1998, for some initial attempts to find event-related potential measurements of brain activity corresponding to the components of the DLT ). An important part of a theory of sentence comprehension is a theory of how sentence structures are assembledsentence parsingas words are input one at a time. Two important components of sentence parsing consume computational resources:",

They occur either because they are underwritten by genetic code, because they assist in language processing or language learning, or due to some combination of the two. In this paper we investigate one such language universal: the suffixing preference across the world's languages, whereby inflections tend to be added to the end of words. A corpus analysis of child-directed speech in English found that suffixes were more accurate at cuing the grammatical category of the root word than were prefixes. An artificial language experiment found that there was a learning advantage for suffixes over prefixes in terms of grammatical categorization within an artificial language. The results are consistent with an account of language universals that originate in general purpose learning mechanisms.",

Many of these advances were made using experimental paradigms with artificial languages that allow for careful manipulation of the statistical regularities in the input. This article summarizes how these paradigms have begun to inform bilingualism research. We focus on two complementary goals that have emerged from studies of statistical learning in bilinguals. The first is to identify whether bilinguals differ from monolinguals in how they track distributional regularities. The second is determining how learners are capable of tracking multiple inputs, which arguably is an important facet of becoming proficient in more than one language.",

Given that SL tasks can measure different aspects of foreign language learning, which aspects benefit from bilingual experience is still largely unexplored. Here, we compared a Spanish monolingual and two (Spanish-Basque and Spanish-English) bilingual groups across three well-established SL tasks. Each task targeted a different aspect of foreign language learning as a proxy—i.e., word segmentation, morphological rule generalization, and word-referent learning. In Experiment 1, we manipulated sub-lexical phonotactic patterns to vary the difficulty of three SL tasks, and the results showed no differences between the groups in word segmentation. In Experiment 2, we included non-adjacent dependencies to target affixal morphology rule learning, and again there were no differences between the groups. Finally, Experiment 3 addressed word learning using a more challenging audio-visual SL task combining exclusive and multiple word-referent mappings. We observed a bilingual experience effect only for the exclusive mappings but not for the multiple mappings. These results suggest that bilingual experience might mainly exert influences on statistical language learning at the lexical level. We discuss these findings by contextualizing SL as a cognitive mechanism, an experimental task, and a proxy for foreign language learning, highlighting the strengths and limitations in detecting bilingual experience effects.",

There has been a growing interest in understanding how sensitivity to statistical regularities influences learning to read. The current study systematically examined whether and how non-linguistic SL, Chinese SL, and English SL contribute to Chinese and English word reading among native Chinese-speaking 4th, 6th and 8th graders who learn English as a second language (L2). Children showed above-chance learning across all SL tasks and across all grades. In addition, developmental improvements were shown across at least two of the three grade ranges on all SL tasks. In terms of the contribution of SL to reading, non-linguistic auditory SL (ASL), English visual SL (VSL), and Chinese ASL accounted for a significant amount of variance in English L2 word reading. Non-linguistic ASL, Chinese VSL, English VSL, and English ASL accounted for a significant amount of variance in Chinese word reading. Our results provide clear and novel evidence for cross-linguistic contribution from Chinese SL to English reading, and from English SL to Chinese reading, highlighting a bi-directional relationship between SL in one language and reading in another language.",

Participants became sensitive to several temporal-order statistics, both rapidly and with no overt task or explicit instructions. Sequences of shapes presented during familiarization were distinguished from novel sequences of familiar shapes, as well as from shape sequences that were seen during familiarization but less frequently than other shape sequences, demonstrating at least the extraction of joint probabilities of 2 consecutive shapes. When joint probabilities did not differ, another higher-order statistic (conditional probability) was automatically computed, thereby allowing participants to predict the temporal order of shapes. Results of a single-shape test documented that lower-order statistics were retained during the extraction of higher-order statistics. These results suggest that observers automatically extract multiple statistics of temporal events that are suitable for efficient associative learning of new temporal features.",

        "abstract": "The contribution of consonants and vowels in spoken word processing has been widely investigated, and studies have found a phenomenon of a Consonantal bias (C-bias), indicating that consonants carry more weight than vowels. However, across languages, various patterns have been documented, including that of no preference or a reverse pattern of Vowel bias. A central question is how the manifestation of the C-bias is modulated by language-specific factors. This question can be addressed by cross-linguistic studies. Comparing native Hebrew and native English speakers, this study examines the relative importance of transitional probabilities between non-adjacent consonants as opposed to vowels during auditory statistical learning (SL) of an artificial language. Hebrew is interesting because its complex Semitic morphological structure has been found to play a central role in lexical access, allowing us to examine whether morphological properties can modulate the C-bias in early phases of speech perception, namely, word segmentation. As predicted, we found a significant interaction between language and consonant/vowel manipulation, with a higher performance in the consonantal condition than in the vowel condition for Hebrew speakers, namely, C-bias, and no consonant/vowel asymmetry among English speakers. We suggest that the observed interaction is morphologically anchored, indicating that phonological and morphological processes interact during early phases of auditory word perception.",

We demonstrate that such a division of labor between consonants and vowels plays a role in language acquisition. In two very similar experimental paradigms, we show that 12-month-old infants rely more on the consonantal tier when identifying words (Experiment 1), but are better at extracting and generalizing repetition-based srtuctures over the vocalic tier (Experiment 2). These results indicate that infants are able to exploit the functional differences between consonants and vowels at an age when they start acquiring the lexicon, and suggest that basic speech categories are assigned to different learning mechanisms that sustain early language acquisition.",

From a learnability point of view, functors might provide entry points or anchors into the syntactic structure of utterances due to their high frequency. Despite its potentially universal scope, this hypothesis has not yet been tested on typologically different languages and on populations of different ages. Here we report a corpus study and an artificial grammar learning experiment testing the anchoring hypothesis in Basque, Japanese, French, and Italian adults. We show that adults are sensitive to the distribution of functors in their native language and use them when learning new linguistic material. However, compared to infants' performance on a similar task, adults exhibit a slightly different behavior, matching the frequency distributions of their native language more closely than infants do. This finding bears on the issue of the continuity of language learning mechanisms.",

This learning problem might be solved by using distributional cues to word boundaries — for example, by computing the transitional probabilities between sounds in the language input and using the relative strengths of these probabilities to hypothesize word boundaries. The learner might be further aided by language-specific prosodic cues correlated with word boundaries. As a first step in testing these hypotheses, we briefly exposed adults to an artificial language in which the only cues available for word segmentation were the transitional probabilities between syllables. Subjects were able to learn the words of this language. Furthermore, the addition of certain prosodic cues served to enhance performance. These results suggest that distributional cues may play an important role in the initial word segmentation of language learners. q 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",

These functional biases could be powerful bootstrapping mechanisms for learning language, but their developmental origin remains unclear. The relative importance of consonants and vowels at the onset of lexical acquisition was assessed in French-learning 5-month-olds by testing sensitivity to minimal phonetic changes in their own name. Infants' reactions to mispronunciations revealed sensitivity to vowel but not consonant changes. Vowels were also more salient (on duration and intensity) but less distinct (on spectrally based measures) than consonants. Lastly, vowel (but not consonant) mispronunciation detection was modulated by acoustic factors, in particular spectrally based distance. These results establish that consonant changes do not affect lexical recognition at 5 months, while vowel changes do; the consonant bias observed later in development does not emerge until after 5 months through additional language exposure.",

Support for this is provided by form-priming experiments that demonstrate robust facilitation when primes and targets share similar sequences of letters. The authors examined form-orthographic priming effects in Hebrew, Arabic, and English. Hebrew and Arabic have an alphabetic writing system but a Semitic morphological structure. Hebrew morphemic units are composed of noncontiguous phonemic (and letter) sequences in a given word. Results demonstrate that form-priming effects in Hebrew or Arabic are unreliable, whereas morphological priming effects with minimal letter overlap are robust. Hebrew bilingual subjects, by contrast, showed robust form-priming effects with English material, suggesting that Semitic words are lexically organized by morphological rather than orthographic principles. The authors conclude that morphology can constrain lexical organization even in alphabetic orthographies and that visual processing of words is first determined by morphological characteristics.",

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.",

Although learning to read involves both auditory and visual modalities, it is not known whether reading skills might be more strongly associated with auditory SL or visual SL. Here we assessed SL across both modalities in 36 typically developing children and 36 healthy adults using the classic triplet-learning paradigm. Auditory SL was significantly associated with sentence reading fluency (Woodcock Johnson III Test of Achievement) in the combined sample of children and adults after controlling for age and nonverbal intelligence. In further analysis of the child data, auditory SL was significantly associated with nonword reading accuracy (Woodcock Reading Mastery Test), a relationship which appeared to be mediated by phonological processing abilities (Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing). These findings suggest that auditory SL might contribute more strongly to certain aspects of reading development compared to visual SL.",

Here, we address this question by assessing to what extent the frequency of syllabic co‐occurrences in the learners’ native language determines SL performance. We computed the frequency of co‐occurrences of syllables in spoken Spanish through a transliterated corpus, and used this measure to construct two artificial familiarization streams. One stream was constructed by embedding pseudowords with high co‐occurrence frequency in Spanish (“Spanish‐like” condition), the other by embedding pseudowords with low co‐occurrence frequency (“Spanish‐unlike” condition). Native Spanish‐speaking participants listened to one of the two streams, and were tested in an old/new identification task to examine their ability to discriminate the embedded pseudowords from foils. Our results show that performance in the verbal auditory SL (ASL) task was significantly influenced by the frequency of syllabic co‐occurrences in Spanish: When the embedded pseudowords were more “Spanish‐like,” participants were better able to identify them as part of the stream. These findings demonstrate that learners’ task performance in verbal ASL tasks changes as a function of the artificial language's similarity to their native language, and highlight how linguistic prior knowledge biases the learning of regularities.",

A common finding is the greater importance for consonants than vowels in spoken word processing, henceforth the C-bias. What underlies the C-bias is a controversial issue between the \"acquired functional hypothesis\" and the \"initial-bias hypothesis.\" The former predicts a different pattern of asymmetry among languages, while the latter claims that the C-bias exists in all languages. Hebrew is interesting because it allows the exploration of whether language-specific morphological properties can modulate consonant/vowel asymmetry. This opportunity stems from its unique complex Semitic morphological structure that was found to have a central role in lexical access. To evaluate the consonant/vowel asymmetry in Hebrew in relation to previously studied languages, recognition of morphologically complex Hebrew words was compared with recognition of foreign Hebrew words that do not have the typical Hebrew morphological complex structure, hereafter simple words. The results showed a significantly stronger C-bias for morphologically complex words than for simple words. We suggest that this within-variation supports the acquired functional hypothesis, so that even within one language different patterns of consonant/vowel asymmetry are revealed depending on the internal morphological structure of the word.

        "abstract": "Abstract Languages vary in the mapping of relational terms onto events. For instance, English motion descriptions favor manner (how something moves) verbs over path (where something move) verbs, whereas those of other languages, like Spanish, show the opposite pattern. While these lexicalization biases are malleable, adopting a novel lexicalization pattern can be slow for second language learners. One potential mechanism for learning non-native verb mappings is cross-situational statistical learning (CSSL). However, the application of CSSL to verbs is limited and does not explicitly examine how lexicalization biases may complicate adults’ ability to resolve the referential uncertainty of multiple referents. We ask English-speaking monolingual adults to learn the mappings of ten verbs via CSSL. Verbs mapped onto either manner or path of motion, with the other event component held constant. Adults in both conditions demonstrated successful learning of novel verbs, with adults learning the manner verbs showing more consistent performance across accepting correct referents and rejecting incorrect ones. Our results are the first to demonstrate adults’ use of CSSL to acquire verb meanings that both align with and cut against native lexicalization biases and suggest a limited influence of lexicalization biases on adults’ learning in idealized CSSL conditions.",

However, the underlying mechanisms that make statistical learning possible and powerful are not yet known. With the goal of providing new insights into this issue, the research reported in this paper used an eye tracker to record the moment-by-moment eye movement data of 14-month-old babies in statistical learning tasks. Various measures are applied to such fine-grained temporal data, such as looking duration and shift rate (the number of shifts in gaze from one visual object to the other) trial by trial, showing different eye movement patterns between strong and weak statistical learners. Moreover, an information-theoretic measure is developed and applied to gaze data to quantify the degree of learning uncertainty trial by trial. Next, a simple associative statistical learning model is applied to eye movement data and these simulation results are compared with empirical results from young children, showing strong correlations between these two. This suggests that an associative learning mechanism with selective attention can provide a cognitively plausible model of cross-situational statistical learning. The work represents the first steps in using eye movement data to infer underlying real-time processes in statistical word learning.",

First, we assume we can isolate elements scparately within the domain of meaning and within the domain of surface expression. These are semantic elements like ‘Motion’, ‘Path’, ‘Figure’, ‘Ground’, ‘Manner’, anrl ‘Cause’, and surface elements like ‘verb’, ‘adposition’, ‘subordinate clausc’, and what we will cliaracterize as ‘satellite’. Second, we examine which semantic elements are expressed by which surface elements. This relatinnship is largely not orle-to-one. A coml)ination of semnntic elements can be expressed by a single surface elemcnt, or ü single semantic element hy a combinatiun of surface elements. Or again, semantic elemeuts of different types can be exptessed by the same type of surface elenient, as well as the same type by severa1 dif-t‘erent ones. We finrl here a range of typological palterns anti universal principies. We do n»t look at every case of semantic-to-surface association, but only at enes that constitute a pervasive pattern, either within a language 01’ across lunguages.

            "abstract": "Previous research in cross-situational statistical learning has established that people can track statistical information across streams in order to map nonce words to their referent objects (Yu and Smith, 2007). Under some circumstances, learners are able to acquire multiple mappings for a single object (e.g., Yurovsky and Yu, 2008). Here we explore whether having a contextual cue associated with a new mapping may facilitate this process, or the conscious awareness of learning. Using a cross-situational statistical learning paradigm, in which learners could form both 1:1 and 2:1 word–object mappings over two phases of learning, we collected confidence ratings during familiarization and provided a retrospective test to gage learning. In Condition 1, there were no contextual cues to indicate a change in mappings (baseline). Conditions 2 and 3 added contextual cues (a change in speaker voice or explicit instructions, respectively) to the second familiarization phase to determine their effects on the trajectory of learning. While contextual cues did not facilitate acquisition of 2:1 mappings as assessed by retrospective measures, confidence ratings for these mappings were significantly higher in contextual cue conditions compared to the baseline condition with no cues. These results suggest that contextual cues corresponding to changes in the input may influence the conscious awareness of learning.",

Cross-situational learning studies have shown that word-object mappings can be learned across multiple situations, as can verbs when presented in a syntactic context. However, these previous studies have presented either nouns or verbs in ambiguous contexts and thus bypass much of the complexity of multiple grammatical categories in speech. We show that noun word learning in adults is robust when objects are moving, and that verbs can also be learned from similar scenes without additional syntactic information. Furthermore, we show that both nouns and verbs can be acquired simultaneously, thus resolving category-level as well as individual word-level ambiguity. However, nouns were learned more quickly than verbs, and we discuss this in light of previous studies investigating the noun advantage in word learning.",

These questions were investigated in two studies of adult English and Spanish speakers' descriptions of static (Study 1) and dynamic (Study 2) motion events. English speakers overwhelmingly used manner-of-motion verbs (e.g. run). Spanish speakers used more path-of-motion verbs (e.g. salir/exit); however, with some motion events they strongly preferred to use manner verbs as well. The two language groups also differed in the degree to which they mentioned the manner of motion at all, and in the types of sentence frames they preferred, but not in the sheer number of verb types produced. The results are discussed with respect to the varying contexts of language use, refinements to typological differences between English and Spanish, and implications for children's acquisition of motion verbs.",

We aim to further understand older adults’ statistical learning abilities using a cross-situational statistical learning paradigm in which learners map novel words to novel objects. In Experiment 1, we manipulated task difficulty and found an overall age deficit but no interaction between age and difficulty. In Experiment 2, after extended practice with a first set of object-word mappings, learners could remap a subset of previously learned words to novel objects. Based on hyper-binding, older adults might be more willing to remap previously learned words to novel objects. However, despite overall poorer learning, older adults were actually less likely to remap. Even though older adults may have an associative memory deficit, learned associations are not more weakly bound for older relative to younger adults.",

Their findings showed that statistical learning ability was a significant predictor of Esperanto pattern learning but not of working memory capacity. Extending this finding, they also found a significant relationship between statistical learning ability and the learning of the patterns of English double object constructions. They concluded that scores on the artificial grammar learning task were predictive of individual differences in the L2 learners’ pattern learning in Esperanto and English. These findings, which contradict those of Robinson (2005), suggest the need for further investigation of the relationship between statistical learning ability and individual differences in second/foreign language learning.

Siegelman, Bogaerts, and Frost (2016) pointed out that offline test scores used to assess the final learning stage in an AGL task do not provide information on the participants’ implicit learning of statistical regularities across time, and furthermore, that the previous studies administered their offline tests only after the learning phase (i.",

            "title": "From the Cover: Statistical learning of new visual feature combinations by infants",
            "abstract": "Present theories of high-level vision posit that object recognition is based on internal representations of complex features stored in extrastriate cortical areas (1–4), and that these features are constrained by mechanisms at the level of retinal ganglion cells (5) and striate cortex simple cells (6) which are tuned optimally to explore statistical regularities in the visual input. However, it is not clear what process governs the selection and learning of complex features, specific views (7), or object-parts (8) that serve as the canonical building blocks for representing the higher-order structure of objects. It has been proposed that any effective associative learning of higher-order visual features requires access to the predictability of one element's appearance in the presence of another element, i.e., the conditional probabilities between image elements (9, 10). In the absence of such information, the observer will be unable to differentiate the actual underlying structure of scenes from meaningless coincidences. However, there has not been a demonstration that human infants could rely on conditional probabilities of image elements in developing complex visual representations of their environment. \n \nWe tested 9-month-old infants in three experiments by using a habituation paradigm to determine whether they naturally extract statistics from unknown scenes that would allow them to develop new higher-order representations efficiently. In each experiment, infants first were familiarized to a series of scenes, each composed of 3 elements of a pool of 12 colored geometric shapes (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). Eight of the elements were grouped into two horizontal and two vertical pairs (base pairs), so that the elements within pairs always appeared together in a fixed spatial relationship. Four elements were “noise” elements, in that they appeared without a fixed spatial relationship to any other element. Each scene consisted of one base pair and one noise element placed within an invisible 2 by 2 grid. Each noise element was assigned to one particular base pair, so that the noise element and the related base pair always appeared together, but in one of four different spatial relationships within the available locations of the grid. Thus, there were a total of 16 possible scenes repeated many times in random order during the habituation phase. Each scene was presented for 2 sec in a looming format to maximize the infants' interest (11). The scenes were composed of arbitrary shapes in a regular layout rather than multipart nonsense objects or sets of Gabor stimuli to avoid any interference between preexisiting mechanisms sensitive to low-level attributes (e.g., orientation) or Gestalt principles (e.g., proximity or shape-similarity) and our goal of measuring the statistical relationships between elements (12). Because the infant could easily discriminate between the elements in the scenes, which appeared many times, only the higher-order structure of element cooccurrences could serve as relevant information for representing the scenes. \n \n \n \nFig 1. \n \nStimulus elements and scenes used in the experiments. (a) The twelve shapes were grouped into four base pairs and four noise elements, with each noise element appearing with only one base pair. (b) The four possible scenes created by one base pair and ... \n \n \n \nOnce each infant was habituated, as indexed by a predetermined criterion of decline in looking time to the display, the test phase began. For the test, two base pairs and two non-base pairs were selected randomly for each infant. The non-base pairs consisted of one element of a base pair and the corresponding noise element that appeared with that pair. The base and non-base test pairs were presented in a standard posthabituation test phase to assess looking times to these two types of test pairs. A significant difference in looking time signaled that the infant could discriminate the base pair from the non-base pair.",

            "Over the past two decades, much research has focused on statistical learning (SL), and particularly, in the field of cognitive psychology, on sensitivity to distributional patterns in sequential input (Gómez, 2002; Gómez & Gerken, 1999, 2000; Gómez & Maye, 2005; Onnis, Waterfall, & Edelman, 2008; Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996; Saffran, Newport, & Aslin, Saffran et al. 1996a, b; Takahashi and Lidz, 2008; Thompson and Newport, 2007). Similarly, language acquisition research has conceptualized this ability as the ability to learn language implicitly, meaning without explicit instruction. Implicit learning is defined as the ability to be “automatic, associative, nonconscious, and unintentional” (Kaufman et al., 2010, p. 321). There seems to be a common consensus that statistical learning is a basic cognitive mechanism, which, as an instance of implicit learning, may be related to a mechanism involved in language acquisition and processing. Without intending to suggest that statistical learning and implicit learning are identical, this study follows Pacton and Perruchet (2008) and Conway and Christiansen (2006) in “consider[ing] implicit learning and statistical learning to refer to the same underlying phenomenon: inducing structure from input following exposure to multiple exemplars” (p.",

In addition, a number of studies in the field of language acquisition and psycholinguistics have confirmed that object relative clauses create a nonadjacent dependency, which is similar to that of the AGL task. This may explain why the study found no correlation between the RTs on the AGL task and on subject relative clauses. The same asymmetry was also observed in Misyak et al.’s (2010) on-line processing task with an L1 group."

Whereas past research have attributed such differences to variations in verbal working memory or experience with language, we test the hypothesis that individual differences in statistical learning may be associated with differential language performance. We employ a novel paradigm for studying statistical learning on-line, combining a serial-reaction time task with artificial grammar learning. This task offers insights into both the timecourse of and individual differences in statistical learning. Experiment 1 charts the micro-level trajectory for statistical learning of nonadjacent dependencies and provides an on-line index of individual differences therein. In Experiment 2, these differences are then shown to predict variations in participants’ on-line processing of long-distance dependencies involving center-embedded relative clauses. The findings suggest that individual differences in the ability to learn from experience through statistical learning may contribute to variations in linguistic performance.",

A major question in language acquisition in the past few decades has been the extent to which infants use statistical learning mechanisms to acquire their native language. There have been many demonstrations showing infants' ability to extract structures in linguistic input, such as the transitional probability between adjacent elements. This paper reviews current research on how statistical learning contributes to language acquisition. Current research is extending the initial findings of infants' sensitivity to basic statistical information in many different directions, including investigating how infants represent regularities, learn about different levels of language, and integrate information across situations. These current directions emphasize studying statistical language learning in context: within language, within the infant learner, and within the environment as a whole.

In the current study, we designed an artificial tone language to address several questions: can adults track regularities in a tonal language? Is learning enhanced by previous exposure to tone-marking languages? Does bilingualism affect learning in this task? To address these questions, we contrasted the performance of English monolingual adults (Experiment 1), Mandarin monolingual and Mandarin–English bilingual adults (Experiment 2), and non-tonal bilingual adults (Experiment 3) in a statistical learning task using an artificial tone language. The pattern of results suggests that while prior exposure to tonal languages did not lead to significant improvements in performance, bilingual experience did enhance learning outcomes. This study represents the first demonstration of statistical learning of an artificial tone language and suggests a complex interplay between prior language experience and subsequent language learning.",

This learning problem might be solved by using distributional cues to word boundaries — for example, by computing the transitional probabilities between sounds in the language input and using the relative strengths of these probabilities to hypothesize word boundaries. The learner might be further aided by language-specific prosodic cues correlated with word boundaries. As a first step in testing these hypotheses, we briefly exposed adults to an artificial language in which the only cues available for word segmentation were the transitional probabilities between syllables. Subjects were able to learn the words of this language. Furthermore, the addition of certain prosodic cues served to enhance performance. These results suggest that distributional cues may play an important role in the initial word segmentation of language learners. q 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",

More important, the results provide support for a more radical conception, in which the joint attentional processing of 2 events is also a sufficient condition for learning the relation between them. The well-documented effect of contiguity could be a by-product of the fact that attention generally focuses on contiguous events. This reappraisal considerably extends the scope of approaches based on associative or statistical processes.",

Moreover, performance on the explicit task correlated strongly with intelligence quotient, but performance on the implicit task did not. Data from previous experiments were also found to be in agreement with these results. The findings are presented in the context of a general theory of implicit learning proposed recently by Reber (1989a, in press) that derives from considerations of the evolution of cognitive processes. This evolutionary model argues that unconscious, implicit induction systems are evolutionarily older and antedate conscious, explicit learning processes, and that this antiquity carries with it particular patterns of function that differentiate implicit processes from explicit processes.",

However, that interpretation of the data depends on 2 unwarranted assumptions concerning the nature and sensitivity of the tasks used to measure learning. In a replication of this study, we used a 4-choice completion task as a direct measure of learning, in addition to an indirect measure consisting of a rapid serial visual presentation task. Moreover, binary confidence judgments were recorded after each completion trial. This way, we measured systematically the extent to which sequence knowledge was available to consciousness. Supporting the notion that the role of unconscious knowledge was overestimated in Kim et al.'s study, our results reveal that participants' performance cannot be exclusively accounted for by implicit knowledge.",

Across three experiments, Thai English as a Foreign Language (EFL) university students ( N = 140) were exposed to either the transitive construction in Esperanto (e.g., tauro batas cevalon, 'bull hits horse') or the nonprototypical English double-object dative construction (e.g., John built the table a leg). They also completed an aural test of statistical learning and a spoken backward digit-span test of working memory. In Experiment 1, only statistical learning was predictive of Esperanto pattern learning. Experiment 2 targeted pattern learning of the English nonprototypical double-object dative construction. Although working memory was associated with performance in the exposure phase, only statistical learning predicted test performance, as in Experiment 1. Finally, Experiment 3 served as a control condition in which participants were exposed to prototypical datives only during the exposure phase. This experiment showed that neither statistical learning nor working memory were associated with exposure or test performance. The findings are discussed in terms of the engagement of statistical learning and working memory during L2 pattern learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

However, a great deal of knowledge used during spelling is implicit, that is, we are not necessarily aware of the appropriate spelling convention. The goal of this paper is to address how existing theories of implicit cognition may contribute to the understanding of spelling development. The paper includes a review of the adult literature on implicit memory and implicit learning and how this literature may be applied to spelling development. Karmiloff-Smith's (1986, 1992, 1994) multilevel model of representational redescription presents a framework from which to investigate the interrelation of implicit and explicit knowledge and how knowledge representation changes over time. Karmiloff-Smith's model provides insight into observations of children's spelling and can be used as a framework to better understand the development of children's spellings.",

The disadvantage of vowelized words in both speed and accuracy was therefore unexpected, and, furthermore, inconsistent with findings from several other relevant studies. The results suggested that Arab children used a different perceptual and coding strategy when the stimuli differ in their lexical feature (word vs pseudoword) and visual/orthographic feature (vowelized vs unvowelized).",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Statistical learning has been proposed to underlie the developmental transition during infancy from allophonic to phonemic speech sound perception. Based on this, it can be hypothesized that in dyslexic individuals, core phonemic representation deficits arise from reduced sensitivity to the statistical distribution of sounds. This study aims to investigate (a) whether statistical learning contributes to the construction of phonemic representations in typical readers, and (b) whether deficits in statistical learning underlie dyslexia. Fifty-eight children performed an identification task of a non-native phonetic contrast, before and after exposure to the sounds of the continuum. Our results suggest that the statistical distribution of the presented sounds implicitly enhanced the formation of phonemic representations and that dyslexic readers make less use of the statistical cues embedded in oral language, resulting in less distinct phonemic categories and thus a higher risk for failing to establish robust connections between these and written language.",

However, most research modeling language acquisition using artificial languages has focused on only one type of distributional structure at a time. In two experiments, we investigated adult learning of an artificial language that contains dependencies between both adjacent and non-adjacent words. We found that learners rapidly acquired both types of regularities and that the strength of the adjacent statistics influenced learning of both adjacent and non-adjacent dependencies. Additionally, though accuracy was similar for both types of structure, participants' knowledge of the deterministic non-adjacent dependencies was more explicit than their knowledge of the probabilistic adjacent dependencies. The results are discussed in the context of current theories of statistical learning and language acquisition.",

Standard training methods have achieved moderate effects using explicit instructions and performance feedback. In this study, the authors question preexisting assumptions by demonstrating a superiority of implicit training procedures. They trained 3 groups of Greek adults on a difficult Hindi contrast (a) explicitly, with feedback (Experiment 1), or (b) implicitly, unaware of the phoneme distinctions, with (Experiment 2) or without (Experiment 3) feedback. Stimuli were natural recordings of consonant-vowel syllables with retroflex and dental unvoiced stops by a native Hindi speaker. On each trial, participants heard pairs of tokens from both categories and had to identify the retroflex sounds (explicit condition) or the sounds differing in intensity (implicit condition). Unbeknownst to participants, in the implicit conditions, target sounds were always retroflex, and distractor sounds were always dental. Post-training identification and discrimination tests showed improved performance of all groups, compared with a baseline of untrained Greek listeners. Learning was most robust for implicit training without feedback. It remains to be investigated whether implicitly trained skills can generalize to linguistically relevant phonetic categories when appropriate variability is introduced. These findings challenge traditional accounts on the role of feedback in phonetic training and highlight the importance of implicit, reward-based mechanisms.",

Sixteen dyslexic and 16 control university students were administered a full battery of psychometric, phonological, auditory, visual and cerebellar tests. Individual data reveal that all 16 dyslexics suffer from a phonological deficit, 10 from an auditory deficit, four from a motor deficit and two from a visual magnocellular deficit. Results suggest that a phonological deficit can appear in the absence of any other sensory or motor disorder, and is sufficient to cause a literacy impairment, as demonstrated by five of the dyslexics. Auditory disorders, when present, aggravate the phonological deficit, hence the literacy impairment. However, auditory deficits cannot be characterized simply as rapid auditory processing problems, as would be predicted by the magnocellular theory. Nor are they restricted to speech. Contrary to the cerebellar theory, we find little support for the notion that motor impairments, when found, have a cerebellar origin or reflect an automaticity deficit. Overall, the present data support the phonological theory of dyslexia, while acknowledging the presence of additional sensory and motor disorders in certain individuals.",

Poor readers often have a host of auditory, linguistic, and attention deficits, including abnormal neural representation of speech and inconsistent performance on psychoacoustic tasks. We hypothesize that this constellation of deficits associated with reading disorders arises from the human auditory system failing to respond to sound in a consistent manner, and that this inconsistency impinges upon the ability to relate phonology and orthography during reading. In support of this hypothesis, we show that poor readers have significantly more variable auditory brainstem responses to speech than do good readers, independent of resting neurophysiological noise levels. Thus, neural variability may be an underlying biological contributor to well established behavioral and neural deficits found in poor readers.",

We scanned a new group of phonetic learners using structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Voxel-based morphometry indicated higher white matter (WM) density in left Heschl's gyrus (HG) in faster compared with slower learners, and manual segmentation of this structure confirmed that the WM volume of left HG is larger in the former compared with the latter group. This finding was replicated in a reanalysis of the original groups tested in Golestani and others (2002, Anatomical correlates of learning novel speech sounds. Neuron 35:997-1010). We also found that faster learners have a greater asymmetry (left > right) in parietal lobe volumes than slower learners and that the right insula and HG are more superiorly located in slower compared with faster learners. These results suggest that left auditory cortex WM anatomy, which likely reflects auditory processing efficiency, partly predicts individual differences in an aspect of language learning that relies on rapid temporal processing. It also appears that a global displacement of components of a right hemispheric language network, possibly reflecting individual differences in the functional anatomy and lateralization of language processing, is predictive of speech sound learning.",

Some of these dependencies may be adjacent to one another whereas others can be separated by considerable intervening material. Research on statistical learning has begun to explore how such adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies may be learned—but in separate studies. In this paper, we investigate whether both types of dependencies can be learned together, similarly to the task facing young children. Statistical learning of adjacent and non-adjacent dependencies was assessed using a modified serial-reaction-time task. The results showed (i) increasing online sensitivity to both dependency types during training, and (ii) non-adjacent dependency learning being highly correlated with adjacent dependency learning. These results suggest that adjacency and non-adjacency learning can occur in parallel and that they might be subserved by a common statistical learning mechanism.",

Misyak (jbm36@cornell.edu) Morten H. Christiansen (christiansen@cornell.edu) Department of Psychology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA Abstract Although statistical learning (SL) is widely assumed to play a key role in language, few empirical studies aim to directly and systematically link variation across SL and language. In this study, we build on prior work linking differences in nonadjacent SL to on-line language, by examining individual- differences in adjacent SL. Experiment 1 documents the trajectory of adjacency learning and establishes an individual- differences index for statistical bigram learning. Experiment 2 probes for within-subjects associations between adjacent SL and on-line sentence processing in three different contexts (involving embedded subject-object relative-clauses, thematic fit constraints in reduced relative-clause ambiguities, and subject-verb agreement). The findings support the notion that proficient adjacency skills can lead to an over-attunement towards computing local statistics to the detriment of more efficient processing patterns for nonlocal language dependencies. Finally, the results are discussed in terms of questions regarding the proper relationship between adjacent and nonadjacent SL mechanisms. Keywords: Predictive Dependencies; Sentence Processing; Bigrams; Serial Reaction Time; Artificial Grammar Introduction With the expansion of studies on statistical learning (SL) over the past decades, focus has intensified towards probing the potential role for probabilistic sequence learning capabilities in acquiring and using linguistic structure (e.g., Gomez, 2002; Saffran, 2001). A clearer understanding has in turn begun to crystallize about the ways in which SL mechanisms may underpin language across various levels of organization—phonetic, lexical, semantic, syntactic—and across differing timescales—phylogenetic, ontogenetic, and microsecond unfoldings. Largely missing from this picture, however, is empirical evidence that directly links language and SL abilities within the typical population. There are, though, a few recent studies that address the issue of whether better statistical learners are indeed better processors of language. In a small-scale study of individual differences, Misyak and Christiansen (2007) observed that standard measures of SL performance are positively associated with comprehension accuracy for various sentence-types in natural language. Conway, Bauernschmidt, Huang and Pisoni (2010) reported that better SL performance correlates with better processing of perceptually-degraded speech in highly-predictive lexical contexts. Misyak, Christiansen and Tomblin (2010) found that more-skilled statistical learners of nonadjacent structure were also more adept at the on-line processing of long- distance dependencies in natural language. Thus far, these results would support the general assumption that SL and language processes are systematically interrelated, with positive correspondence in intraindividual variation across them. But is it always the case that greater SL is associated with better language functioning? Or, may excelling at one of these implicate poorer performance at the other? Such ability-linked reversals in performances within a cognitive domain would not be unprecedented. As an example, bilingual individuals appear to possess more efficient ‘inhibitory control’ processes than their monolingual peers across a number of studies, which has usually been imputed in some manner to bilinguals’ greater experience with ‘control’ processes for suppressing irrelevant information in the course of successfully using two languages (see Bialystok et al., 2004). However, in a negative priming paradigm where distractor locations that were supposed to be previously ignored became relevant for facilitating responses to a current trial (as they do for monolinguals), bilinguals are at a disadvantage in the cognitive control task, with decreases from a neutral baseline in performance accuracy (Trecanni et al., 2009). Analogously then, might there be natural language contexts in which superior SL skill also becomes disadvantageous? One possibility is that a statistical learner may focus too much on computing certain statistics, while ignoring others, with repercussions for their linguistic processing. For example, language embodies predictive dependencies that can be broadly characterized as involving either adjacent or nonadjacent temporal relationships. Thus, a good adjacency learner might perform poorly on nonadjacent dependencies in language. Introducing a new task for documenting micro- level trajectories and individual differences in SL, Misyak et al. (2010) were able to link variation in nonadjacent SL positively to signature differences in reading time patterns for the complex nonlocal dependency structure of center- embedded object-relative clause sentences. However, this study raises a new set of questions, including ones that directly bear on the above hypothetical, namely: Does the timecourse of adjacent SL differ from that of nonadjacent SL? Can substantial differences in adjacent SL also be empirically related to on-line sentence processing? And if so, might this differ from the kinds of positive correlations observed for nonadjacency processing? We investigated these questions by adapting the AGL- SRT paradigm from Misyak et al. (2010) to isolate the learning of adjacent dependencies. The task implements an artificial grammar (AG) within a modified two-choice serial reaction-time (SRT) layout, using auditory-visual sequence-",

Two speakers were selected such that tone 2 of the low-pitched speaker and tone 3 of the high-pitched speaker occurred at equivalent F0 heights. Production and perception experiments determined that turning point (or inflection point of the tone), and delta F0 (the difference in FO between onset and turning point) distinguished the two tones. Three tone continua varying in either turning point, delta FO, or both acoustic dimensions, were then appended to a natural precursor phrase from each of the two speakers. Results showed identification shifts such that identical stimuli were identified as low tones for the high precursor condition, but as high tones for the low precursor condition. Stimuli varying in turning point showed no significant shift, suggesting that listeners normalize only when the precursor varies in the same dimension as the stimuli. The magnitude of the shift was greater for stimuli varying only in delta FO, as compared to stimuli varying in both turning point and delta FO, indicating that normalization effects are reduced for stimuli more closely matching natural speech.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundTone languages such as Thai and Mandarin Chinese use differences in fundamental frequency (F0, pitch) to distinguish lexical meaning. Previous behavioral studies have shown that native speakers of a non-tone language have difficulty discriminating among tone contrasts and are sensitive to different F0 dimensions than speakers of a tone language. The aim of the present ERP study was to investigate the effect of language background and training on the non-attentive processing of lexical tones. EEG was recorded from 12 adult native speakers of Mandarin Chinese, 12 native speakers of American English, and 11 Thai speakers while they were watching a movie and were presented with multiple tokens of low-falling, mid-level and high-rising Thai lexical tones. High-rising or low-falling tokens were presented as deviants among mid-level standard tokens, and vice versa. EEG data and data from a behavioral discrimination task were collected before and after a two-day perceptual categorization training task.ResultsBehavioral discrimination improved after training in both the Chinese and the English groups. Low-falling tone deviants versus standards elicited a mismatch negativity (MMN) in all language groups. Before, but not after training, the English speakers showed a larger MMN compared to the Chinese, even though English speakers performed worst in the behavioral tasks. The MMN was followed by a late negativity, which became smaller with improved discrimination. The High-rising deviants versus standards elicited a late negativity, which was left-lateralized only in the English and Chinese groups.ConclusionResults showed that native speakers of English, Chinese and Thai recruited largely similar mechanisms when non-attentively processing Thai lexical tones. However, native Thai speakers differed from the Chinese and English speakers with respect to the processing of late F0 contour differences (high-rising versus mid-level tones). In addition, native speakers of a non-tone language (English) were initially more sensitive to F0 onset differences (low-falling versus mid-level contrast), which was suppressed as a result of training. This result converges with results from previous behavioral studies and supports the view that attentive as well as non-attentive processing of F0 contrasts is affected by language background, but is malleable even in adult learners.",

            "abstract": "Over the course of the first year of life, infants develop from being generalized listeners, capable of discriminating both native and non-native speech contrasts, into specialized listeners whose discrimination patterns closely reflect the phonetic system of the native language(s). Recent work by Maye, Werker and Gerken (2002) has proposed a statistical account for this phenomenon, showing that infants may lose the ability to discriminate some foreign language contrasts on the basis of their sensitivity to the statistical distribution of sounds in the input language. In this paper we examine the process of enhancement in infant speech perception, whereby initially difficult phonetic contrasts become better discriminated when they define two categories that serve a functional role in the native language. In particular, we demonstrate that exposure to a bimodal statistical distribution in 8-month-old infants' phonetic input can lead to increased discrimination of difficult contrasts. In addition, this exposure also facilitates discrimination of an unfamiliar contrast sharing the same phonetic feature as the contrast presented during familiarization, suggesting that infants extract acoustic/phonetic information that is invariant across an abstract featural representation.",

This developmental pattern is interpreted as reflecting the onset of language-specific processing around the first birthday. However, generalization of this finding is limited by the fact that studies have yielded inconsistent results and that insufficient numbers of phonetic contrasts have been tested developmentally; this is especially true for native-language phonetic contrasts. Three experiments assessed the effects of language experience on affricate-fricative contrasts in a cross-language study of English and Mandarin adults and infants. Experiment 1 showed that English-speaking adults score lower than Mandarin-speaking adults on Mandarin alveolo-palatal affricate-fricative discrimination. Experiment 2 examined developmental change in the discrimination of this contrast in English- and Mandarin-leaning infants between 6 and 12 months of age. The results demonstrated that native-language performance significantly improved with age while performance on the non-native contrast decreased. Experiment 3 replicated the perceptual improvement for a native contrast: 6-8 and 10-12-month-old English-learning infants showed a performance increase at the older age. The results add to our knowledge of the developmental patterns of native and non-native phonetic perception.",

In this cross-language ͑Mandarin Chinese, English͒ study of the categorical nature of tone perception, we compared native Mandarin and English speakers' perception of a physical continuum of fundamental frequency contours ranging from a level to rising tone in both Mandarin speech and a homologous ͑nonspeech͒ harmonic tone. This design permits us to evaluate the effect of language experience by comparing Chinese and English groups; to determine whether categorical perception is speech-specific or domain-general by comparing speech to nonspeech stimuli for both groups; and to examine whether categorical perception involves a separate categorical process, distinct from regions of sensory discontinuity, by comparing speech to nonspeech stimuli for English listeners. Results show evidence of strong categorical perception of speech stimuli for Chinese but not English listeners. Categorical perception of nonspeech stimuli was comparable to that for speech stimuli for Chinese but weaker for English listeners, and perception of nonspeech stimuli was more categorical for English listeners than was perception of speech stimuli. These findings lead us to adopt a memory-based, multistore model of perception in which categorization is domain-general but influenced by long-term categorical representations.",

Very young infants can discriminate a wide range of native and nonnative consonants and vowels, and then in a process of perceptual reorganization over the 1st year, discrimination of most nonnative speech sounds deteriorates. We investigated perceptual reorganization for tones by testing 6- and 9-month-old infants from tone (Chinese) and nontone (English) language environments for speech (lexical tone) and nonspeech (violin sound) tone discrimination in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Overall, Chinese infants performed equally well at 6 and 9 months for both speech and nonspeech tone discrimination. Conversely, English infants’ discrimination of lexical tone declined between 6 and 9 months of age, whereas their nonspeech tone discrimination remained constant. These results indicate that the reorganization of tone perception is a function of the native language environment, and that this reorganization is linguistically based.",

Two stages were implemented, passive exposure to visual regularities and forced decision task. In the first stage, the participants were passively presented with four shapes; each shape was displayed with unique invariant features, which present the regularities of the shape in addition to variant features. In the second stage, the participants were presented with forced decision task and were asked to make an acceptance or rejection of presented 160 shapes according to their own preferences regarding the shapes familiarity. Eighty of the presented shapes were compatible with the visual regularities as was presented in the passive learning stage where the other shapes presented the non-compatible condition. The results indicated that typical readers showed significantly higher levels of true responses in the decision task. In addition, among the typical readers group shorter response times were significantly recorded for the compatible items compared to non-compatible items. Such differences in response times were not observed among the poor readers. The results support the assumption that poor orthographic learning among poor readers could be associated with inefficient statistical learning capacities.",

It then discusses research on how statistical learning plays out in learning to spell, how spelling should be taught, and similarities and differences among learners. The focus is on the learning of English, although studies of other alphabetic writing systems are also considered. Research shows that, from an early age, children use their statistical learning skills to learn about the visual characteristics of written words. Children also use their statistical learning skills to help learn about the relations between visual units and units of language, supplementing what they are explicitly taught in school.\n\n\nConclusion\nStatistical learning plays an important role in learning to spell, and this can help to explain why some aspects of spelling are more difficult to learn than others. If children are to learn to spell effectively and efficiently, structured instruction is also important.",

Forty kindergartners and first graders were taught to read 12 words containing either single consonants (e.g., FAN) or doubled consonants in initial illegal or final legal positions (e.g., RRUG or JETT). Children required fewer trials to learn to read legally spelled words with single or doubled consonants than illegally spelled words containing initial doublets. On a spelling posttest, children recalled single consonants somewhat better than final doublets, and final doublets much better than initial illegal doublets. More advanced beginning readers tended to regularize illegal initial doublets by doubling the final rather than initial consonants when they wrote these words. Poorer learning and memory for initial doublets occurred despite the salience of their position in words. Findings indicate that beginning readers use orthographic patterns to read and remember words earlier than predicted by phase theory, but their memory is constrained by their knowledge of written word structure.",

Instead, reading might capitalize on evolutionary older mechanisms that originally supported other tasks. Accordingly, animals such as baboons can be trained to perform visual word recognition. This suggests that the visual mechanisms supporting reading might be phylogenetically old and domain-general. Here we propose that if the human reading system relies on domain-general visual mechanisms, effects that are typically found within the domain of reading should also be observable with non-orthographic visual stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we systematically tested different types of visual material with the same experimental design. Subjects were passively familiarized with a set of composite visual items, and then tested in an oddball paradigm for their ability to detect novel stimuli. Some of these novel stimuli shared their statistical structure with the familiar items, and were found to be hard to detect in two experiments using strings of letter-like symbols; this replicates the well-known, and supposedly reading-specific, bigram effect. Crucially, in two further experiments we show that the same effect emerges with made-up, 3D objects and sinusoidal gratings. The effect size was equivalent across experiments, despite the use of radically different stimuli. These data suggest that a fundamental mechanism behind visual word learning also supports the learning of other visual stimuli, implying that such mechanism is general–purpose. This mechanism would enable the statistical learning of regularities in the visual environment.",

In this study, we investigated how adults’ prior experience with sublexical regularities in their native language inﬂuences performance on an empirical language learning task. Forty German-speaking adults completed a speech repetition task in which they repeated eight-syllable sequences from two experimental languages: one containing disyllabic words comprised of frequently occurring German syllable transitions (naturalistic words) and the other containing words made from unattested syllable transitions (non-naturalistic words). The participants demonstrated learning from both naturalistic and non-naturalistic stimuli. However, learning was superior for the naturalistic sequences, indicating that the participants had used their existing distributional knowledge of German to extract the naturalistic words faster and more accurately than the non-naturalistic words. This ﬁnding supports theories of statistical learning as a form of chunking, whereby frequently co-occurring units become entrenched in long-term memory.",

Such tests ostensibly assess specialized processes for the short-term manipulation and maintenance of information that are often argued to enable long-term learning. However, there is considerable evidence for an influence of long-term linguistic learning on performance in short-term memory tasks that brings into question the role of a specialized short-term memory system separate from long-term knowledge. Using natural language corpora, we show experimentally and computationally that performance on three widely used measures of short-term memory (digit span, nonword repetition, and sentence recall) can be predicted from simple associative learning operating on the linguistic environment to which a typical child may have been exposed. The findings support the broad view that short-term verbal memory performance reflects the application of long-term language knowledge to the experimental setting.",

In this research, we explored a different type of relationship between language learning and statistical learning: the possibility that learning a new language may also influence statistical learning by changing the regularities to which learners are sensitive. We tested two groups of participants, Mandarin Learners and Naïve Controls, at two time points, 6 months apart. At each time point, participants performed two different statistical learning tasks: an artificial tonal language statistical learning task and a visual statistical learning task. Only the Mandarin-learning group showed significant improvement on the linguistic task, whereas both groups improved equally on the visual task. These results support the view that there are multiple influences on statistical learning. Domain-relevant experiences may affect the regularities that learners can discover when presented with novel stimuli.",

The aim of the present study was (1) to test this assumption directly by investigating how instructions (incidental vs. intentional) and presentation rate (fast vs. slow) affect the acquisition of knowledge and (2) to examine how these factors influence the conscious vs. unconscious nature of the knowledge acquired. To this aim, we exposed participants to four triplets of shapes, presented sequentially in a pseudo-random order, and assessed their degree of learning in a subsequent completion task that integrated confidence judgments. Supporting Arciuli et al.’s (2014) claim, participant performance only benefited from intentional instructions at slow presentation rates. Moreover, informing participants beforehand about the existence of statistical regularities increased their explicit knowledge of the sequences, an effect that was not modulated by presentation speed. These results support that, although visual statistical learning can take place incidentally and, to some extent, outside conscious awareness, factors such as presentation rate and prior knowledge can boost learning of these regularities, presumably by favoring the acquisition of explicit knowledge.",

Many researchers have not considered the full power of the chunking hypothesis as both a learning mechanism and as an explanation of human behavior. Indeed, in developmental psychology there is relatively little mention of chunking and yet it can be the underlying cause of some of the mechanisms of development that have been proposed. This paper illustrates the chunking hypothesis in the domain of non-word repetition, a task that is a strong predictor of a child’s language learning. A computer simulation of non-word repetition that instantiates the chunking mechanism shows that: (1) chunking causes task behavior to improve over time, consistent with children’s performance; and (2) chunking causes perceived changes in areas such as short-term memory capacity and processing speed that are often cited as mechanisms of child development. Researchers should be cautious when considering explanations of developmental data, since chunking may be able to explain differences in performance without the need for additional mechanisms of development.",

Based on the idea that humans tend to select the simplest structures, it implements a dynamic hierarchical chunking mechanism in which the decision whether to create a new chunk is based on an information-theoretic criterion, the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We present theoretical justifications for this approach together with results of an experiment in which participants, exposed to meaningless symbols, have been implicitly encouraged to create high-level concepts by grouping them. Results show that the designed model, called hereafter MDLChunker, makes precise quantitative predictions both on the kind of chunks created by the participants and also on the moment at which these creations occur. They suggest that the simplicity principle used to design MDLChunker is particularly efficient to model chunking mechanisms. The main interest of this model over existing ones is that it does not require any adjustable parameter.",

            "abstract": "In three experiments, we investigated Hebb repetition learning (HRL) differences between children and adults, as a function of the type of item (lexical vs. sub-lexical) and the level of item-overlap between sequences. In a first experiment, it was shown that when non-repeating and repeating (Hebb) sequences of words were all permutations of the same words, HRL was slower than when the sequences shared no words. This item-overlap effect was observed in both children and adults. In a second experiment, we used syllable sequences and we observed reduced HRL due to item-overlap only in children. The findings are explained within a chunking account of the HRL effect on the basis of which we hypothesize that children, compared with adults, chunk syllable sequences in smaller units. By hypothesis, small chunks are more prone to interference from anagram representations included in the filler sequences, potentially explaining the item-overlap effect in children. This hypothesis was tested in a third experiment with adults where we experimentally manipulated the chunk size by embedding pauses in the syllable sequences. Interestingly, we showed that imposing a small chunk size caused adults to show the same behavioral effects as those observed in children. Departing from the analogy between verbal HRL and lexical development, the results are discussed in light of the less-is-more hypothesis of age-related differences in language acquisition.",

A possible explanation is that statistical learning is typically tested using the two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. As a meta-cognitive task relying on explicit familiarity judgments, 2AFC may not accurately capture implicitly formed statistical computations. In this paper, we adapt the classic serial-recall memory paradigm to implicitly test statistical learning in a statistically-induced chunking recall (SICR) task. We hypothesized that artificial language exposure would lead subjects to chunk recurring statistical patterns, facilitating recall of words from the input. Experiment 1 demonstrates that SICR offers more finegrained insights into individual differences in statistical learning than 2AFC. Experiment 2 shows that SICR has higher test-retest reliability than that reported for 2AFC. Thus, SICR offers a more sensitive measure of individual differences, suggesting that basic chunking abilities may explain statistical learning.",

However, attempts to bridge the two have yielded ambiguous results. We suggest that an empirical disconnect between the computations employed during learning and the methods employed at test may explain these mixed results. Further, we propose statistically-based chunking as a potential computational link between artificial and natural language learning. We compare the acquisition of non-adjacent dependencies to that of natural language structure using two types of tasks: reflection-based 2AFC measures, and processing-based recall measures, the latter being more computationally analogous to the processes used during language acquisition. Our results demonstrate that task-type significantly influences the correlations observed between artificial and natural language acquisition, with reflection-based and processing-based measures correlating within – but not across – task-type. These findings have fundamental implications for artificial-to-natural language comparisons, both methodologically and theoretically.",

Recently, Barr, Levy, Scheepers, and Tily, 2013 recommended fitting `maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification.",

We have implemented the Satterthwaite's method for approximating degrees of freedom for the t and F tests. We have also implemented the construction of Type I - III ANOVA tables. Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package). Some other convenient mixed model analysis tools such as a step method, that performs backward elimination of nonsignificant effects - both random and fixed, calculation of population means and multiple comparison tests together with plot facilities are provided by the package as well.",

In this book, Anne Cutler argues that listening to speech is a process of native listening because so much of it is exquisitely tailored to the requirements of the native language. Her cross-linguistic study (drawing on experimental work in languages that range from English and Dutch to Chinese and Japanese) documents what is universal and what is language specific in the way we listen to spoken language. Cutler describes the formidable range of mental tasks we carry out, all at once, with astonishing speed and accuracy, when we listen. These include evaluating probabilities arising from the structure of the native vocabulary, tracking information to locate the boundaries between words, paying attention to the way the words are pronounced, and assessing not only the sounds of speech but prosodic information that spans sequences of sounds. She describes infant speech perception, the consequences of language-specific specialization for listening to other languages, the flexibility and adaptability of listening (to our native languages), and how language-specificity and universality fit together in our language processing system. Drawing on her four decades of work as a psycholinguist, Cutler documents the recent growth in our knowledge about how spoken-word recognition works and the role of language structure in this process. Her book is a significant contribution to a vibrant and rapidly developing field.",

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.",

Despite the similarity in research questions, the two literatures have remained largely separate. Here, we draw on findings from the two traditions to critically evaluate two developmental predictions that are central to both. The first is the question of age invariance: Does learning improve during development or is it fully developed in infancy? The combined findings suggest that both implicit and statistical learning improve during childhood, contra the age invariance prediction. This raises questions about the role of implicit statistical learning (ISL) in explaining the age-related deterioration in language learning: Children's better language learning abilities cannot be attributed to their improved distributional learning skills. The second issue we examine is the predictive relation to language outcomes: Does variation in learning predict variation in language outcomes? While there is evidence for such links, there is concern in both research traditions about the reliability of the tasks used with children. We present data suggesting that commonly used statistical learning measures may not capture stable individual differences in children, undermining their utility for assessing the link to language outcomes in developmental samples. The evaluation of both predictions highlights the empirical parallels between the implicit and statistical learning literatures, and the need to better integrate their developmental investigation. We go on to discuss several of the open challenges facing the study of ISL during development.",

This work has mostly focused on transitional probabilities, in vision, audition, by newborns, children, adults, in normal developing and clinical populations.

            "abstract": "Tests of nonword repetition (NWR) have often been used to examine children's phonological knowledge and word learning abilities. However, theories of NWR primarily explain performance either in terms of phonological working memory or long-term knowledge, with little consideration of how these processes interact. One theoretical account that focuses specifically on the interaction between short-term and long-term memory is the chunking hypothesis. Chunking occurs because of repeated exposure to meaningful stimulus items, resulting in the items becoming grouped (or chunked); once chunked, the items can be represented in short-term memory using one chunk rather than one chunk per item. We tested several predictions of the chunking hypothesis by presenting 5-6-year-old children with three tests of NWR that were either high, medium, or low in wordlikeness. The results did not show strong support for the chunking hypothesis, suggesting that chunking fails to fully explain children's NWR behavior. However, simulations using a computational implementation of chunking (namely CLASSIC, or Chunking Lexical And Sub-lexical Sequences In Children) show that, when the linguistic input to 5-6-year-old children is estimated in a reasonable way, the children's data are matched across all three NWR tests. These results have three implications for the field: (a) a chunking account can explain key NWR phenomena in 5-6-year-old children; (b) tests of chunking accounts require a detailed specification both of the chunking mechanism itself and of the input on which the chunking mechanism operates; and (c) verbal theories emphasizing the role of long-term knowledge (such as chunking) are not precise enough to make detailed predictions about experimental data, but computational implementations of the theories can bridge the gap.",

Here, we address this question by assessing to what extent the frequency of syllabic co‐occurrences in the learners’ native language determines SL performance. We computed the frequency of co‐occurrences of syllables in spoken Spanish through a transliterated corpus, and used this measure to construct two artificial familiarization streams. One stream was constructed by embedding pseudowords with high co‐occurrence frequency in Spanish (“Spanish‐like” condition), the other by embedding pseudowords with low co‐occurrence frequency (“Spanish‐unlike” condition). Native Spanish‐speaking participants listened to one of the two streams, and were tested in an old/new identification task to examine their ability to discriminate the embedded pseudowords from foils. Our results show that performance in the verbal auditory SL (ASL) task was significantly influenced by the frequency of syllabic co‐occurrences in Spanish: When the embedded pseudowords were more “Spanish‐like,” participants were better able to identify them as part of the stream. These findings demonstrate that learners’ task performance in verbal ASL tasks changes as a function of the artificial language's similarity to their native language, and highlight how linguistic prior knowledge biases the learning of regularities.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies show that infants experience perceptual reorganization (PR) in the first year of life, after which their sensitivity towards most nonnative speech contrasts greatly decreases. Also, it has been shown that infants can track distributional information from the ambient speech input. Dutch infants of 5-6 and 11-12 months were tested on their perception of a tonal contrast in Mandarin Chinese under uni/bimodal distributions. Results show that statistical learning influences infants’ discrimination of the non-native tonal contrast at 11-12 months, whereas this effect diminishes before the onset of tonal PR at 5-6 months. Two control groups of Dutch infants were tested on their discrimination to the same lexical tonal contrast without statistical exposure. Results showed that only young infants (5-6 months) but not older infants (11-12 months) discriminated the contrast. This not only supports earlier claims that tonal PR occurs at 6-9 months, but also reveals that the effects of PR can be partly reversed by distributional learning as 11-month-old infants’ perception of non-native tones was facilitated in the bimodal condition.",

One mechanism that may underlie this perceptual change is distributional learning, a statistical analysis of the distributional frequency of speech sounds. Previous distributional learning studies have tested infants of 6-8 months, an age at which native phonetic categories have not yet developed. Here, three experiments test infants of 10 months to help illuminate perceptual ability following perceptual reorganization. English-learning infants did not change discrimination in response to nonnative speech sound distributions from either a voicing distinction (Experiment 1) or a place-of-articulation distinction (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, familiarization to the place-of-articulation distinction was doubled to increase the amount of exposure, and in this case infants began discriminating the sounds. These results extend the processes of distributional learning to a new phonetic contrast, and reveal that at 10 months of age, distributional phonetic learning remains effective, but is more difficult than before perceptual reorganization.",

        "abstract": "A growing statistical learning literature suggests that listeners extract statistical information from the linguistic environment. However, distributional frequency may be insufﬁcient for important but relatively low-frequency cues. Acquisition of linguistic knowledge may rely not merely on co-occurrences but on predictive relationships between cues and their outcomes. The present study investigates effects of predictive temporal cue structure on acquisition of a non-native acoustic cue dimension. During training, native English speakers saw coloured shape objects and heard spoken Min Chinese words with six different lexical tones. Tones were the only reliable cue to identifying the associated object. Words also contained a salient cue that did not discriminate between objects. Three tones occurred with high-frequency and three with low-frequency in training. The critical manipulation was the presentation order: either words, containing complex cue structure, preceded object outcomes (discriminative order) or objects preceded words (non-discriminative order). Generalised linear mixed models showed accuracy was signiﬁcantly higher in the discriminative order than the non-discriminative order. These results demonstrate that predictive cue structure can facilitate acquisition of a non-native cue di-mension. Feedback from prediction error drives learners to ignore salient non-discriminative cues and effectively learn to use the target cue dimension.",

            "abstract": "A 2-layer symbolic network model based on the equilibrium equations of the Rescorla-Wagner model (Danks, 2003) is proposed. The study first presents 2 experiments in Serbian, which reveal for sentential reading the inflectional paradigmatic effects previously observed by Milin, Filipović Đurđević, and Moscoso del Prado Martín (2009) for unprimed lexical decision. The empirical results are successfully modeled without having to assume separate representations for inflections or data structures such as inflectional paradigms. In the next step, the same naive discriminative learning approach is pitted against a wide range of effects documented in the morphological processing literature. Frequency effects for complex words as well as for phrases (Arnon & Snider, 2010) emerge in the model without the presence of whole-word or whole-phrase representations. Family size effects (Moscoso del Prado Martín, Bertram, Häikiö, Schreuder, & Baayen, 2004; Schreuder & Baayen, 1997) emerge in the simulations across simple words, derived words, and compounds, without derived words or compounds being represented as such. It is shown that for pseudo-derived words no special morpho-orthographic segmentation mechanism, as posited by Rastle, Davis, and New (2004), is required. The model also replicates the finding of Plag and Baayen (2009) that, on average, words with more productive affixes elicit longer response latencies; at the same time, it predicts that productive affixes afford faster response latencies for new words. English phrasal paradigmatic effects modulating isolated word reading are reported and modeled, showing that the paradigmatic effects characterizing Serbian case inflection have crosslinguistic scope.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) have difficulties acquiring the grammatical rules of their native language. It has been proposed that children’s detection of sequential statistical patterns correlates with grammatical proficiency and hence that a deficit in the detection of these regularities may underlie the difficulties with grammar observed in children with DLD. Although there is some empirical evidence supporting this claim, individual studies, both in children with and without DLD, vary in the strength of their reported associations. The aim of the present study is therefore to evaluate the evidence for the proposed association. This is achieved by means of (a) a conceptual replication study on 35 children with DLD and 35 typically developing children who performed the serial reaction time task and a test of grammatical proficiency and (b) a meta-analysis over 19 unique effect sizes, which collectively examined the serial reaction time task – expressive grammar correlation in 139 children with DLD and 573 typically developing children. Both outcomes provide no evidence for or against the existence of the proposed association. Neither do they provide evidence for a difference in the strength of the association between both groups of children.",

This study examined the relationship between measures of verbal and non‐verbal implicit and explicit learning and measures of language, literacy and arithmetic attainment in a large sample of 7 to 8‐year‐old children. Measures of verbal explicit learning were correlated with measures of attainment. In contrast, no relationships between measures of implicit learning and attainment were found. Critically, the reliability of the implicit learning tasks was poor. Our results show that measures of procedural learning, as currently used, are typically unreliable and insensitive to individual differences.

Whereas past research have attributed such differences to variations in verbal working memory or experience with language, we test the hypothesis that individual differences in statistical learning may be associated with differential language performance. We employ a novel paradigm for studying statistical learning on-line, combining a serial-reaction time task with artificial grammar learning. This task offers insights into both the timecourse of and individual differences in statistical learning. Experiment 1 charts the micro-level trajectory for statistical learning of nonadjacent dependencies and provides an on-line index of individual differences therein. In Experiment 2, these differences are then shown to predict variations in participants’ on-line processing of long-distance dependencies involving center-embedded relative clauses. The findings suggest that individual differences in the ability to learn from experience through statistical learning may contribute to variations in linguistic performance.",

Participants were 7- to 11-year-old children with SLI (n = 48), typically developing age-matched children (n = 20) and younger typically developing children matched for receptive grammar (n = 28). In a serial reaction time task, the children with SLI performed at the same level as the grammar-matched children, but poorer than age-matched controls in learning motor sequences. When tested with a motor procedural learning task that did not involve learning sequential relationships between discrete elements (i.e. pursuit rotor), the children with SLI performed comparably with age-matched children and better than younger grammar-matched controls. In addition, poor implicit learning of word sequences in a verbal memory task (the Hebb effect) was found in the children with SLI. Together, these findings suggest that SLI might be characterized by deficits in learning sequence-specific information, rather than generally weak procedural learning.",

Data from qualifying studies were extracted and converted to Hedges' g effect sizes.\n\n\nResults\nThe overall standardized mean difference between participants with SLI and participants without SLI was 0.54, which was significantly different from 0 (p < .001, 95% confidence interval [0.36, 0.71]).\n\n\nConclusion\nTogether, the results of our meta-analysis indicate a robust difference between people with SLI and people without SLI in their detection of statistical regularities in the auditory input. The detection of statistical regularities is, on average, not as effective in people with SLI compared with people without SLI. The results of this meta-analysis are congruent with a statistical learning deficit hypothesis in SLI.\n\n\nSupplemental Material\nhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.5558074.",

One hundred children ages 4 years 5 months through 6 years 11 months completed a test of implicit statistical learning, a test of explicit declarative learning, and standardized tests of verbal and nonverbal ability. They also completed a syntactic priming task, which provided a dynamic index of children's facility to detect and respond to changes in the input frequency of linguistic structure. The results showed that implicit statistical learning ability was directly associated with the long-term maintenance of the primed structure. The results constitute the first empirical demonstration of a direct association between implicit statistical learning and syntactic acquisition in children.",

However, it is widely debated what the task is testing and therefore how informative it is.\n\n\nAIMS\n(1) To evaluate the effects of different types of long-term linguistic knowledge on immediate recall, (2) to assess age sensitivity of repetition tasks designed to evaluate these effects, and (3) to establish if the effects are similar across typologically different languages. The study also considers the implications of the findings for the use of sentence repetition as a research and clinical assessment tool.\n\n\nMETHODS & PROCEDURES\nParticipants were 50 English-speaking and 50 Czech-speaking typically developing 4-5-year-olds. Children's ability to recall sequences of items was compared in seven linguistic conditions ranging from fully well-formed sentences to sequences of non-words. In each condition, children repeated blocks of successively longer stimuli to establish their span.\n\n\nOUTCOMES & RESULTS\nResults showed significant but differential effects of all linguistic factors in both languages. While syntactic violations and presence of non-words dramatically reduced children's span, semantic implausibility and the removal of sentence prosody played a significant but much smaller role. Familiarity of function words was more important than familiarity of content words. The effects of different linguistic factors on spans were the same for both languages and did not change between 4 and 5 years, although average spans increased over this age range.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS\nChildren's ability to repeat sentences is more dependent on their familiarity with morphosyntax and lexical phonology than semantics or prosody, with function words of particular importance. Findings have implications for the use of recall in clinical assessment and as a research tool.",

This allowed examination of more than one type of marker simultaneously, facilitating both comparisons between markers and also evaluation of combinations of markers in relation to identifying SLI. The study also provided data regarding the markers in relation to nonverbal IQ, made use of new normative data on all tasks, and examined marker accuracy in relation to current language status. The results show that markers vary in accuracy, with sentence repetition (a previously unused marker) proving to be the most useful. This psycholinguistic marker shows high levels of sensitivity (90%), specificity (85%), and overall accuracy (88%), as well as being able to identify the majority of children whose current language status falls in the normal range despite a history of SLI.",

Asking judgments of children is problematic, and an offline task is suboptimal as it reflects only the outcome of the learning process, disregarding information on the learning trajectory. Therefore, and following up on recent methodological advancements in the online measurement of nonadjacent dependency learning in adults, the current study investigates if the recording of response times can be used to establish nonadjacent dependency learning in children. Forty-six children (mean age: 7.3 years) participated in a child-friendly adaptation of a nonadjacent dependency learning experiment (López-Barroso, Cucurell, Rodríguez-Fornells, & de Diego-Balaguer, 2016). They were exposed to an artificial language containing items with and without nonadjacent dependencies while their response times (online measure) were measured. After exposure, grammaticality judgments (offline measure) were collected. The results show that children are sensitive to nonadjacent dependencies, when using the online measure (the results of our offline measure did not provide evidence of learning). We therefore conclude that future studies can use online response time measures (perhaps in addition to the offline grammaticality judgments) to further investigate nonadjacent dependency learning in children.",

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.",

We investigated the relationships between measures of basic cognitive processes (declarative learning, procedural learning and attention) and measures of attainment (reading, grammar and arithmetic) in a large sample of 7- and 8-year-old children. A latent variable path model showed that verbal declarative memory skills predicted attainment but were not significantly related to attention. Procedural learning was only weakly related to measures of attainment and attention assessed during the procedural learning task accounted entirely for its relationship with measures of attainment. Our results challenge the procedural deficit hypothesis of reading and language disorders, but suggest that attentional skills (rather than procedural learning ability per se) may be an important predictor of reading, arithmetic and grammatical skills.",

            "abstract": "Successful language use requires the ability to process nonadjacent dependencies (NADs) that occur in linguistic input. Learning such structural regularities seems therefore crucial for children, and researchers have indeed proposed that language problems in children with developmental language disorder (DLD), especially problems with grammar, are due to their decreased sensitivity to NADs. Because the evidence supporting this claim is scarce, we compared children with DLD (n = 36; Mage = 9.1 years) and without DLD (n = 36; Mage = 9.1 years) performing a learning task with NADs. Using response times as an online measure of learning NADs, we observed that participants with DLD were less sensitive to NADs than were typically developing peers. The confidence intervals of the effect, however, indicated that the effect was probably small in size. We discuss clinical and theoretical implications of the present study in light of this effect size. Open Practices: This article has been awarded Open Materials and Open Data badges.

            "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to investigate procedural learning across the lifespan in typical and atypical development. Procedural learning is essential for the development of everyday skills, including language and communication skills. Although procedural learning efficiency has been extensively studied, there is no consensus yet on potential procedural learning changes during development and ageing. Currently, three conflicting models regarding this trajectory exist: (1) a model of age invariance; (2a) a model with a peak in young adulthood; and (2b) a model with a plateau in childhood followed by a decline. The aims of this study were (1) to investigate this debate on procedural learning across the lifespan by systematically reviewing evidence for each model from studies using the serial reaction time task; and (2) to review procedural learning in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI), two developmental disorders characterized by deficits in communication skills, in the light of these models. Our findings on typical development strongly support a model of age-related changes (Model 2a or 2b) and show that mixed findings regarding the developmental trajectory during childhood can be explained by methodological differences across studies. Applying these conclusions to systematic reviews of studies of ASD and SLI makes it clear that there is a strong need for the inclusion of multiple age groups in these clinical studies to model procedural learning in atypical development. Clinical implications of the findings are discussed. Future research should focus on the role of declarative learning in both typical and atypical development.",

After testing 36 primary-school-aged children (ages 7;8–10;4) with DLD and their TD peers on a self-paced VSL task, two reading tasks and a spelling task, we find no evidence for or against a VSL deficit in DLD, nor for associations between VSL and literacy in DLD.

An accidental inversion of words or letters or sounds can produce grotesque alterations of a sentence, and to scramble the elements at random is to turn a sensible message into gibberish. No attack upon the problems of verbal behavior will be satisfactory if it does not take quantitative account of the patterns of verbal elements. We can dependably produce and distinguish only a small number of different letters or speech sounds. We must use these few elements to talk about millions of different things and situations. To stretch these few elements to cover these many needs, we are forced to combine the elements into patterns and to assign a different significance to each pattern. Since the number of possible patterns increases exponentially as the length of the pattern increases, this proves to be an efficient method of solving the problem.",

Resisting the conventional wisdom that says that if the mind is a large neural network it cannot simultaneously be a manipulator of symbols, Marcus outlines a variety of ways in which neural systems could be organized so as to manipulate symbols, and he shows why such systems are more likely to provide an adequate substrate for language and cognition than neural systems that are inconsistent with the manipulation of symbols. Concluding with a discussion of how a neurally realized system of symbol-manipulation could have evolved and how such a system could unfold developmentally within the womb, Marcus helps to set the future agenda of cognitive neuroscience.",

        "abstract": "Children with SLI (CwSLI) are identified to have a significant delay in language (mostly in expressive language), with preserved non-verbal abilities. There are different views put forth to account for deficits among CwSLI, which are namely, cognitive-based (deficits in working memory and procedural memory), language-based (morpho-syntax deficits) and perception-based (perceptual acoustic deficit in listening). Studies have concluded that sentences processing is relatively slow in CwSLI, compared to their normal peers. The ability to track dependencies between the syntactic constituents in a sentence structure (example-subject-verb agreements), is vital for language acquisition and processing. This study aimed to explore the statistical learning of dependencies among CwSLI, through a sentence processing task. on to the appropriate icon (tick icon for syntactically correct sentence and wrong icon for a syntactically wrong sentence), which were displayed on screen. Accuracy was the measured dependent variable. Results revealed CwSLI performed poorly (i.e. more errors) on processing sentences with non-adjacent dependencies than in adjacent dependencies, when compared to their normal peers. This provides insights into statistical learning among CwSLI. Montgomery (2000) examined influence of the verbal working memory in sentence comprehension among Children with Specific Language Impairment (CwSLI). The study included twelve CwSLI with a mean age of 8.6 years, twelve chronologically age-matched (CA) children with a mean age of 8.7 years and twelve children who were matched for receptive vocabulary with a mean age of 6.8 years. The SLI group’s receptive and expressive score were lesser than 1 SD below the mean, when assessed with the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals – Revised (CELF-R) and they performed at least 1 SD below the mean on Test of Reception of Grammar (TROG). The other two groups performed either at or above – 1 level from the mean, on same language measures. There were two main tasks in the experiment – Task for Verbal Working Memory (VWM) and Task for Comprehension of non-redundant and redundant sentences. The first task (VWM) included a stimuli of 25 words (without any rhyming words), taken from 5 semantic categories, namely, animals, plant-things, transportation, clothing and body parts. All these words were uttered and recorded from a native male English speaker. A total of 5 word lists were created (3-word lists, 4-word lists, 5-word lists, 6- word lists and 7-word lists), with each list including words with at least 2 semantic category. the words",

However, before we look to the brain to see what areas are associated with language processing phenomena, it is necessary to have good psychological theories of the relevant behavioral phenomena. Recent results have suggested that constructing an interpretation for a sentence involves the moment-by-moment integration of a variety of different information sources, constrained by the available computational resources (see, e.g., Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982; MacDonald, Pearlmutter, and Seidenberg 1994; Trueswell, Tanenhaus, and Garnsey 1994; Trueswell1996; Tyler and MarslenWilson 1977; McClelland, St. John, and Taraban 1989; Pearlmutter and MacDonald 1992; Crain and Steedman 1985; Altmann and Steedman, 1988; Ni , Crain, and Shankweiler 1996; see Gibson and Pearlmutter 1998 and Tanenhaus and Trueswell 1995 for summaries). This chapter presents evidence for one theory of resource use in sentence co\"mprehension: the dependency locality theory (DLT ). If the evidence for a theory such as this one accumulates, it will then make sense to look for neural correlates of the theory (see Kaan et ale 1998; Harris 1998, for some initial attempts to find event-related potential measurements of brain activity corresponding to the components of the DLT ). An important part of a theory of sentence comprehension is a theory of how sentence structures are assembledsentence parsingas words are input one at a time. Two important components of sentence parsing consume computational resources:",

In this study, we investigated whether individuals with specific language impairment (SLI)—who have problems with long-distance dependencies in language—also have problems with statistical learning of non-adjacent relations. The results confirmed this hypothesis, indicating that statistical learning may subserve the acquisition and processing of long-distance dependencies in natural language.",

Recent studies of Danish — a language characterized by frequent long sequences of vocoids in speech — have suggested that the reduced occurrence of contoids may make speech intrinsically harder to segment than in closely related languages, such as Norwegian. In this study, we addressed this hypothesis empirically in an artificial language learning experiment with native speakers of Danish, Norwegian, and English. We tested whether artificial speech consisting of concatenated contoid-vocoid syllables is easier to segment than speech consisting of vocoid-vocoid syllables (where the first segment is a semivowel and the second a full vowel). Contrary to what was expected, we found no effect of the phonetic makeup of the syllables on speech segmentability. Possible interpretations and implications of this result are discussed.",

The fourth pattern is an intersyllabic preference for initiating words with a labial consonant-vowel-coronal consonant sequence (LC). The CV effects may be primarily biomechanically motivated. The LC effect may be self-organizational, with multivariate causality. The findings support the hypothesis that these four patterns were basic to the origin of words.",

In two very similar experimental paradigms, we show that 12-month-old infants rely more on the consonantal tier when identifying words (Experiment 1), but are better at extracting and generalizing repetition-based srtuctures over the vocalic tier (Experiment 2). These results indicate that infants are able to exploit the functional differences between consonants and vowels at an age when they start acquiring the lexicon, and suggest that basic speech categories are assigned to different learning mechanisms that sustain early language acquisition.",

This study explores this consonant-vowel asymmetry in 16-month-old infants, using an interactive word learning task. It shows that the pattern of the 16-month-olds is the same as that of the 20-month-olds. Infants succeeded with 1-feature consonantal contrasts (either place or voicing) but were at chance level with 1-feature vocalic contrasts (either place or height). These results thus contribute to a growing body of evidence establishing, from early infancy to adulthood, that consonants and vowels have different roles in lexical acquisition and processing.",

It is unclear, though, how infants learn to attend to stress as a cue to word segmentation. This series of experiments was designed to explore infants' attention to conflicting cues at different ages. Experiment 1 replicated previous findings: When stress and statistical cues indicated different word boundaries, 9-month-old infants used syllable stress as a cue to segmentation while ignoring statistical cues. However, in Experiment 2, 7-month-old infants attended more to statistical cues than to stress cues. These results raise the possibility that infants use their statistical learning abilities to locate words in speech and use those words to discover the regular pattern of stress cues in English. Infants at different ages may deploy different segmentation strategies as a function of their current linguistic experience.",

However, not all languages present children with equally clear cues to syllabic structure, and since the specific L1 is known to influence the acquisition rate, it is worth investigating how sonority characteristics in children’s linguistic input influence their lexical acquisition. Danish is characterized by having a monotonous sonority envelope compared to other Scandinavian languages. Danish language acquisition therefore presents us with the opportunity to examine how children respond to the task of word learning when the input language offers less clear cues to syllabic structure than usually seen. To investigate the sound structure in Danish children’s lexical development, we need a model of syllable structure; and as the theoretical basis for our analyses related to sonority we present Basboll’s Sonority Syllable Model for phonotactics, which is based upon a non-circular version of a sonority hierarchy. We investigate spontaneous child language output in a longitudinal corpus with two children aged 9-29 months. For the two children, the phonetic structure of the first ten words to occur is compared with that of the last ten words to occur before 30 months of age, and with that of ten words in between. Measures related to the sonority envelope, viz. sonority types and in particular sonority rises, are applied to this data",

We have also investigated adults learning of regularities among elements that are not adjacent, and have found strong selectivities in their ability to learn various kinds of non-adjacent regularities. In the present paper, we investigate the learning of these same non-adjacent regularities in tamarin monkeys, using the same materials and familiarization methods. Three types of languages were constructed. In one, words were formed by statistical regularities between non-adjacent syllables. Words contained predictable relations between syllables 1 and 3; syllable 2 varied. In a second type of language, words were formed by statistical regularities between non-adjacent segments. Words contained predictable relations between consonants; the vowels varied. In a third type of language, also formed by regularities between non-adjacent segments, words contained predictable relations between vowels; the consonants varied. Tamarin monkeys were exposed to these languages in the same fashion as adults (21min of exposure to a continuous speech stream) and were then tested in a playback paradigm measuring spontaneous looking (no reinforcement). Adult subjects learned the second and third types of language easily, but failed to learn the first. However, tamarin monkeys showed a different pattern, learning the first and third type of languages but not the U * Corresponding author. E-mail address: newport@bcs.rochester.edu (E.L.

Participants became sensitive to several temporal-order statistics, both rapidly and with no overt task or explicit instructions. Sequences of shapes presented during familiarization were distinguished from novel sequences of familiar shapes, as well as from shape sequences that were seen during familiarization but less frequently than other shape sequences, demonstrating at least the extraction of joint probabilities of 2 consecutive shapes. When joint probabilities did not differ, another higher-order statistic (conditional probability) was automatically computed, thereby allowing participants to predict the temporal order of shapes. Results of a single-shape test documented that lower-order statistics were retained during the extraction of higher-order statistics. These results suggest that observers automatically extract multiple statistics of temporal events that are suitable for efficient associative learning of new temporal features.",

Infants in a \"phonetic\" group were visually reinforced for head turns when a change occurred from a background category of labial nasals to a comparison category of alveolar nasals . The infants were initially trained on a [ma]-[na] contrast produced by a male talker. Novel tokens differing in vowel environment and talker were introduced over several stages of increasing complexity. In the most complex stage infants were required to make a head turn when a change occurred from [ma,mi,mu] to [na,ni,nu], with the tokens in each category produced by both male and female talkers. A \" nonphonetic \" control group was tested using the same pool of stimuli as the phonetic condition. The only difference was that the stimuli in the background and comparison categories were chosen in such a way that the sounds could not be organized by acoustic or phonetic characteristics. Infants in the phonetic group transferred training to novel tokens produced by different talkers and in different vowel contexts. However, infants in the nonphonetic control group had difficulty learning the phonetically unrelated tokens that were introduced as the experiment progressed. These findings suggest that infants recognize the similarity of nasal consonants sharing place of articulation independent of variation in talker and vowel context.",

Theorists have taken this to mean that species-specific mechanisms evolved in animals that aid in the detection and recognition of important stimuli. Similar arguments have been made about the mechanisms that underlie the perception of speech in humans. Theories of speech perception present convincing arguments that even the phonetic level of language requires specially evolved mechanisms, because of the extreme complexity involved in the mapping between sound and percept. Phenomena such as categorical perception have been attributed to the workings of these mechanisms. This paper lays out an argument concerning the contribution of animal studies on categorical perception to the special-mechanisms debate. Animals provide a model of auditory-level processing in the absence of phonetic-level processing, and test whether the existence of a phenomenon such as categorical perception necessitates specialized mechanisms. A review of the studies shows that animal demonstrate categorical perception of the voicing and place features. These data, as well as some recent findings on young human infants, are considered with regard to their impact on theories of infant speech perception and on the evolution of speech.",

            "abstract": "Abstract \nThe cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus oedipus) has an extensive vocal repertoire which is derived from the variation of two basic elements and the sequential combination of those elements. A distinctive features analysis demonstrated at least 8 phonetic variants of a short, frequency modulated call (chirp) and five longer constant frequency calls (whistles). The call variants do not describe points on a single motivational continuum, but rather each variant represents a different message. A simple grammar is presented to describe all sequences of calls. While most of the call sequences fit the definition of phonetic syntax, at least two sequences appear to be exemplars of lexical syntax. Call structures are modified to provide increasing cues for auditory localization as animals are farther apart from each other. Comparisons of calls of S. o. oedipus with those of other callitrichids show a gradual divergence of call type with increasing geographic and phylogenic separation. \n \nZusammenfassung \nDas Lautrepertoire des Lisztaffchens (Saguinus oedipus) wird beschrieben, einschlieslich der Situationen, in denen die Laute auftreten, und ihres vermuteten Bedeutungsinhalts. \n \nDas Repertoire beruht weitgehend auf zwei Grund-Elementen: kurzen frequenzmodulierten “Zirplauten” und langeren unmodulierten “Pfiffen”. Diese Elemente werden zu verschiedenen Varianten mit unterschiedlichen Funktionen umgewandelt. Sie konnen auch zu langeren Folgen (Phrasen) zusammengefugt werden. Dem liegt eine einfache Grammatik zugrunde. \n \nMeist haben die Elementfolgen einen anderen Bedeutungsgehalt als die Elemente, aus denen sie bestehen. Es gibt aber auch Folgen, die der Definition einer lexikalischen Syntax genugen, d. h. ihre Bedeutung ist zusammengesetzt aus der Bedeutung der Einzelelemente. \n \nDie akustische Struktur der Laute entspricht den von Morton (1977) fur Tierlaute aufgestellten Merkmalen akustischer Kommunikation. Das Lisztaffchen past die Lautstruktur der Entfernung vom Empfanger an. Je groser der Abstand zwischen den Tieren, desto mehr Orientierungshilfen enthalten die Laute. \n \nDie Laute sind weitgehend denen gleich, die fur verschiedene Unterarten von S. oedipus beschrieben wurden. Zu Nachbararten und Nachbargattungen wachsen die Unterschiede mit groserer geographischer und taxonomischer Entfernung.",

To assess the monkeys' knowledge of the sequential position of each item, pair-wise tests were given to 2 subjects after acquisition of the ABCD series and to 4 subjects after reaching criterion on the ABCDE series. In both tests, the monkeys performed at high levels on the interior pairs, which were BC for the ABCD series, and BC, BD, and CD for the ABCDE series. These results, as well as the orderly relations observed in the pair-wise tests between first-item response latency and first-item position and between second-item response latency and number of missing items, indicated that the monkeys had developed a well-organized internal representation of the four- and five-item series. Although pigeons are also capable of learning four-item and five-item series, they apparently do not develop a comparable representational structure. The disparity between the monkeys' and pigeons' representational competence for serial order is predictable from the difference in their capacities for associative transitivity.",

We can dependably produce and distinguish only a small number of different letters or speech sounds. We must use these few elements to talk about millions of different things and situations. To stretch these few elements to cover these many needs, we are forced to combine the elements into patterns and to assign a different significance to each pattern.

            "abstract": "Previous investigations of the linguistic capacities of apes have focused on the ape's ability to produce words, and there has been little concern for comprehension. By contrast, it is increasingly recognized that comprehension precedes production in the language development of normal human children, and it may indeed guide production. It has been demonstrated that some species can process speech sounds categorically in a manner similar to that observed in humans. Consequently, it should be possible for such species to comprehend language if they have the cognitive capacity to understand word-referent relations and syntactic structure. Popular theories of human language acquisition suggest that the ability to process syntactic information is unique to humans and reflects a novel biological adaptation not seen in other animals. The current report addresses this issue through systematic experimental comparisons of the language comprehension skills of a 2-year-old child and an 8 year-old bonobo (Pan paniscus) who was raised in a language environment similar to that in which children are raised but specifically modified to be appropriate for an ape. Both subjects (child and bonobo) were exposed to spoken English and lexigrams from infancy, and neither was trained to comprehend speech. A common caretaker participated in the rearing of both subjects. All language acquisition was through observational learning. Without prior training, subjects were asked to respond to the same 660 novel sentences. All responses were videotaped and scored for accuracy of comprehension of the English language. The results indicated that both subjects comprehended novel requests and simple syntactic devices. The bonobo decoded the syntactic device of word recursion with higher accuracy than the child; however, the child tended to do better than the bonobo on the conjunctive, a structure that places a greater burden on short-term memory. Both subjects performed as well on sentences that required the ability to reverse work order as they did on sentences that did not require this capacity. These results are discussed in light of a model of the evolution of language that suggests that the potential for language comprehension preceded the appearance of speech by several million years at minimum. The onset of speech is linked to the appearance of fully adapted bipedalism, which necessitated reorientation of the laryngeal tract and made closure of the soft palate possible. For the first time, such closure permitted mammals to easily produce sounds that could be interpreted by the mammalian auditory system in a categorical manner. When these sounds were paired with the previously extant capacity to produce vowels, it became possible to form \"bounded vowels\" or sound units that could readily be discriminated as units by the auditory system. It is suggested that this physical adaptation allowed the extant cognitive capacity of the hominids to embark on a speech-like mode of communication.",

            "abstract": "Capuchin monkeys, Cebus olivaceus, combine different types of calls to form compound calls. These compound calls are syntactically organized (i. e. , there is a predictable ordering of call types in the compound call). The analysis of the syntax of animal communication necessarily includes: (a) Accurate classification of types of calls, and a demonstration that calls that occur both alone and in compound calls are structurally similar. (b) Description of the syntactic rules generating compound calls or call sequences, and classification of types of compound calls or call sequences. (c) Examination of the social circumstances or contexts in which both single and compound calls occur. I followed these steps using a large sample of Cebus olivaceus calls, recorded in riparian gallery forest in central Venezuela. The calls were initially screened using a real-time spectrum analyzer, and a group of structurally related call types was selected for further analysis. Temporal and frequency characteristics of 868 of these calls were measured from sound spectrograms produced on a sound sonograph. Call classification involved first defining a very large number of possible call types on the basis of these characteristics, and then using a discriminant analysis to identify which types should be lumped together. A stepwise procedure was followed, using only calls which occurred singly, until five call types (squaws, chirps, trills, whistles, screams) were statistically separable. Two of these types (trills, whistles) showed considerable within-type variation and were further subdivided into four variants each. Discriminant analysis was then used to demonstrate structurally similarity between calls produced singly and those in compound calls. Social circumstances were defined using similarities in the vocalizer's actions, arousal, orientation to and distance from the presumed receiver. Use of call types, when given singly, covaried predictably with social circumstances and presumably with the internal state of the vocalizer. Different calls expressed different internal states on a continuum from contact-seeking to contact-avoiding. Use of trill and whitle variants also covaried with social circumstances. Different variants expressed different states on a continuum from affiliation or submission to aggression. Combinations of internal states, in theory, might be expressed as intergradations or intermediates between different call types. However, such intermediate states are often coded syntactically. Syntactically organized compound calls accounted for 38% of the total sample. The distribution of social circumstances in which compound calls are given was intermediate between the distributions of the constituent call types, which presumably indicates an intermediate internal state. Compound calls are generated by syntactic rules closely analogous to lexical rules of human language. Specifically they act like compounding rules that combine two lexical entries to form a third. They are not analogous to the grammatical rules that generate human sentences.",

Experiment 1 used elicited-imitation to test 16- and 20-month-olds' immediate and delayed recall (2-week delay) of familiar and novel events. Ordered recall at immediate and delayed test was superior for familiar events and for novel events with causal relations among the elements; ordered recall of novel events lacking causal relations was significantly lower. Experiment 2 tested children's sensitivity to differences in underlying structure of novel events. Nineteen-, 25-, and 31 -month-olds organized recall around causal relations, in spite of experimental manipulations that interrupted causally connected pairs of elements. The experiments provide clear evidence that, like preschoolers and adults, children as young as 16 months include temporal order information in their representations of both familiar and novel events and that the causal structure of novel events influences their recall. Research on children's memory has amply demonstrated that when children are working in a familiar and meaningful context, they exhibit memory skills far more advanced than they do when working in an unfamiliar context stripped of meaning. This lesson provided the impetus for research on children's memory for everyday events and routines. By interviewing 3- to 8-year-old children about their participation in everyday events, Nelson and her colleagues (e.g., Nelson, 1986; Nelson & Gruendel, 1981,1986) have shown that children as young as 3 years of age recall events in a fashion similar to that of older children and adults. The apparent similarities in the structure underlying the event representations of preschoolers and adults has led to the question of whether the event representations of even younger preverbal and early verbal children are similar as well. It is this question that provides the focus for the present research.",

However, listeners rapidly adapt when speech acoustics deviate from these regularities due to talker idiosyncrasies such as foreign accents and dialects. To better understand these dual aspects of speech perception, we probe native English listeners' baseline perceptual weighting of 2 acoustic dimensions (spectral quality and vowel duration) toward vowel categorization and examine how they subsequently adapt to an \"artificial accent\" that deviates from English norms in the correlation between the 2 dimensions. At baseline, listeners rely relatively more on spectral quality than vowel duration to signal vowel category, but duration nonetheless contributes. Upon encountering an \"artificial accent\" in which the spectral-duration correlation is perturbed relative to English language norms, listeners rapidly down-weight reliance on duration. Listeners exhibit this type of short-term statistical learning even in the context of nonwords, confirming that lexical information is not necessary to this form of adaptive plasticity in speech perception. Moreover, learning generalizes to both novel lexical contexts and acoustically distinct altered voices. These findings are discussed in the context of a mechanistic proposal for how supervised learning may contribute to this type of adaptive plasticity in speech perception.",

            "abstract": "The ability to integrate and weight information across dimensions is central to perception and is particularly important for speech categorization. The present experiments investigate cue weighting by training participants to categorize sounds drawn from a two-dimensional acoustic space defined by the center frequency (CF) and modulation frequency (MF) of frequency-modulated sine waves. These dimensions were psychophysically matched to be equally discriminable and, in the first experiment, were equally informative for accurate categorization. Nevertheless, listeners' category responses reflected a bias for use of CF. This bias remained even when the informativeness of CF was decreased by shifting distributions to create more overlap in CF. A reversal of weighting (MF over CF) was obtained when distribution variance was increased for CF. These results demonstrate that even when equally informative and discriminable, acoustic cues are not necessarily equally weighted in categorization; listeners exhibit biases when integrating multiple acoustic dimensions. Moreover, changes in weighting strategies can be affected by changes in input distribution parameters. This methodology provides potential insights into acquisition of speech sound categories, particularly second language categories. One implication is that ineffective cue weighting strategies for phonetic categories may be alleviated by manipulating variance of uninformative dimensions in training stimuli.",

Psychophys. 50, 93-107 (1991); Kuhl et al., Science 255, 606-608 (1992)]. Stimuli judged as exceptionally good instances of phonetic categories (prototypes) make neighboring tokens in the vowel space seem more similar, exhibiting a perceptual magnet effect. Three experiments further examined the perceptual magnet effect in adults. Experiment 1 collected goodness and identification judgments for 13 variants of the vowel /i/. Experiment 2 used signal detection theory to assess the discrimination of these tokens using a bias-free measure (d'). Experiment 3 employed multidimensional scaling (MDS) to geometrically model the distortion of the perceptual space due to the magnet effect. The results demonstrated a strong relationship between category goodness and discrimination. Vowel tokens receiving high goodness ratings in experiment 1 were more difficult to discriminate in experiment 2 and were more tightly clustered in the MDS solutions of experiment 3. These findings support the existence of a perceptual magnet effect, and may help explain some aspects of first language learning in infants and second language learning in adults.",

English listeners relied predominantly on spectrum, but showed some reliance on duration. Russian and Spanish speakers relied entirely on duration. In the second experiment, three tests examined listeners' use of vowel duration in native contrasts. Duration was equally important for the perception of lexical stress for all three groups. However, English listeners relied more on duration as a cue to postvocalic consonant voicing than did native Spanish or Russian listeners, and Spanish listeners relied on duration more than did Russian listeners. Results suggest that, although allophonic experience may contribute to cross-language perceptual patterns, other factors such as the application of statistical learning mechanisms and the influence of language-independent psychoacoustic proclivities cannot be ruled out.",

        "title": "Relating Neural and Behavioural Measures of Statistical Learning to Children's Reading Abilities",
        "abstract": "The process of reading is guided by statistical regularities between orthographic and phonological properties embedded in the English language system. Reliance on these probabilistic cues suggest statistical learning (SL) may be an underlying mechanism in reading ability and variance in SL could explain why those with reading impairments struggle to become proficient readers. Previous research has found a relationship between SL and reading ability; however, majority of these studies use offline measures of SL that are sensitive to secondary processes. The current study examined the link between SL and reading ability in 32 children using traditional measures of SL and a relatively new online measure of electroencephalogram neural entrainment for a pure assessment of SL. Participants showed evidence of SL as measured by online and offline methods; however, no relation between SL and reading ability was found. The implications of this study may inform the ways in which children are taught to read such as implementing more explicit compared to implicit reading activities and instructions. STATISTICAL LEARNING AND READING 3 Relating Neural and Behavioural Measures of Statistical Learning to Children’s Reading Ability From the time we are infants, humans are able to learn statistical regularities in their environment and make predictions based off of those patterns (Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996). This powerful learning mechanism, known as statistical learning (SL), has been shown to take place during passive exposure to complex patterns (Yang & Flombaum, 2015). While SL can occur during a variety of learning processes, it is most commonly understood through the context of speech segmentation. For example, when listening to the phrase “what a pretty baby”, English speakers are able to implicitly identify higher transitional probabilities within words (e.g., pretty) and lower transitional probabilities across word boundaries (e.g., ty-ba). Despite the fact that there are no reliable pauses between words in spoken language, utilizing this transitional probability information allows one to distinguish boundaries between words (e.g., “pretty” and “baby”; Romberg & Saffran, 2010). Moreover, previous research has found typically developing (TD) children are not only able to identify transitional probabilities from an artificial speech stream of non-sense words but they can also recognize newly learned non-words when compared to highly similar non-words (Raviv & Arnon, 2018). Notably, this precise ability to segment speech is an important reading skill when decoding words (White, Mattys, & Wiget, 2012). Reading as Statistical Learning When applying SL to the context of reading acquisition, Arcuili (2018) explained that children learn orthographic (letter combinations) to phonemic (sound) mapping regularities, such as identifying a grapheme (single letter) “a” with the specific phoneme /a/. English is a deep orthographical language system meaning each grapheme can correspond to multiple different phonemes compared to a shallow language system (e.g., Spanish, Croatian) which has a one to one correspondence of graphemes to phonemes (Miller, Kargin, & Guldenoglu, 2014). For STATISTICAL LEARNING AND READING 4 example, the grapheme “a” has inconsistent phonemic representations among words like, “case”, “cat”, and “car” resulting in different orthographic combinations that follow different phonetic patterns, or rule exceptions. Arcuili (2018) explained that the patterns within the English language system follow a number of exceptions and while the majority of these rules are taught using explicit instruction within the classroom, a large portion of language learning involves passive exposure and implicit learning. It could be that certain aspects of SL relate to certain areas within the reading process. More specifically, the complex regularities and exceptions involved in orthographic to phonetic mappings suggests individuals with a precise ability to identify these patterns could have stronger underlying SL abilities. Arciuli and Simpson (2012) showed that variability in SL is related to variability in reading for TD participants. They used a visual SL (VSL) paradigm where a stream of 12 aliens were arranged in four groups of three. Each group formed a specific pattern and aliens were presented on a computer screen one at a time in a continuous stream. Following this exposure phase, participants saw two groups of aliens: a group following the pattern from the stream and a group in an unfamiliar pattern. They had to choose the pattern that was more familiar. Accuracy on this task had a significant correlation to participants standardized scores of reading. Notably, the relationship between VSL and reading suggests that SL ability may be domain general mechanism opposed to domain specific as shown with the non-linguistic stimulus in this study. As further support, native English speakers learning Hebrew showed VSL abilities that were correlated with second language reading ability (Frost, Siegelman, Narkiss, & Afek, 2013). In Hebrew there are two forms of spelling: “pointed” where vowels are included and “unpointed” where no vowels are included (Kutscher & Kutscher, 1982). Better performance on the VSL task resulted in higher un-pointed non-word and pointed word reading ability. Together, STATISTICAL LEARNING AND READING 5 these findings highlight the idea that an ability to distinguish non-linguistic patterns aids in reading ability. As noted previously, language provides probabilistic cues to orthographical and phonological mappings (Arciuli, 2018); it could be that SL is an underlying tool used to learn complexities within the reading process. While it is clear that variability in SL is related to variability in reading for TD participants, past research has not yet looked at SL in children with a range of reading abilities. Reading Impairments and Statistical Learning SL abilities have been known to differ significantly between TD participants and those with reading impairments such as developmental language disorder (DLD; also known as Specific Language Impairment) or developmental dyslexia (DD; Evans, Saffran, & Robe-Torres, 2009; Gabay, Thiessen & Holt, 2015). As a general overview, DLD is defined as difficulties or delays in receptive and expressive language that cannot be explained by another disorder or cause (Powers, Brooks, Obeid, Gillespie-Lynch, & Lum, 2016). In comparison, DD is defined as difficulties with correct word recognition and spelling in the presence of normal IQ and sensory abilities (Snowling, 2000). While these are two separate disorders, both have been implicated in deficits during SL tasks (Bishop & Snowling, 2004; Tomblin, Mainela-Arnold, Zhang, 2007; Gabay, Schiff, & Vakil, 2012). Previous work by Evans et al. (2009) found a deficit in auditory SL (ASL) ability for those with DLD. Participants listened to an artificial speech stream consisting of six tri-syllabic non-sense words that were formed so transitional probabilities were higher within words than between words. After the familiarization phase, children distinguished which word was more familiar between a word from the stream and an unfamiliar word. TD participants performed better than children with DLD; however, when presented with a longer familiarization phase, STATISTICAL LEARNING AND READING 6 children in the DLD also showed equal SL ability as reflected on post measure tasks. Moreover, impaired SL in those with DD has also been found during similar ASL experiments (Gabay et al., 2015). Participants with DD performed significantly worse compared to TD controls during an ASL experiment. These results were correlated with reading ability. The deficits in SL for those with DLD is not only limited to ASL but VSL as well (Sigurdardottir, Danielsdottir, Gudmundsdottir, Hjartarson, Thorarinsdottir, & Kristjánsson, 2017). During a VSL paradigm, 12 shapes grouped into two pairs were presented on at a time in a continuous stream on a computer screen. The shape pairs were counter-balanced so that each pair was always seen together but the pairs were presented in a random order. After being familiarized to the shape patterns, TD participants and participants with DLD were asked to choose which pair of shapes was the most familiar from the stream. Participants with DLD identified a significantly smaller quantity of correct pairs than TD participants. The results of these studies go on to suggest that domain general impairments in SL may explain why those with reading impairments struggle to become proficient readers. Neural Entrainment as a Measure of Statistical Learning The majority of research on SL has used behavioural outcomes such as a familiarization phase followed by a behavioural task; these measurements target long term memory and SL ability (Vlach & Sandhofer, 2014). One way of teasing apart these two mechanisms is by introducing online measurements of neural activity to assess SL through neural entrainment. This occurs when the brain naturally synchronizes brain wave frequency to the rhythm of an external stimulus such as visual or speech patterns (Schroeder & Lakatos, 2008;2009). For example, Paller and Batterink (2017) used electroencephalogram (EEG) data to show that participants perceived tri-syllabic words while listening to an artificial speech stream as whole words STATISTICAL LEARNING AND READING 7 compared to individual syllables. They examined this through participants’ ability to neutrally entrainment the word frequencies compared to the syllable frequencies. Participants were also able to learn these novel words by using high and low transitional probabilities. This was further demonstrated by using a Target Detection Task (TDT) where participants were able to predict final syllables in a word faster than the first syllable, indicating learning. Traditional behavioural methods of assessing SL do so after the learning ha",

            "abstract": "First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence.",

            "abstract": "Purpose\nThe purpose of this tutorial is to explain how learning to read can be thought of as learning statistical regularities and to demonstrate why this is relevant for theory, modeling, and practice. This tutorial also shows how triangulation of methods and cross-linguistic research can be used to gain insight.\n\n\nMethod\nThe impossibility of conveying explicitly all of the regularities that children need to acquire in a deep orthography, such as English, can be demonstrated by examining lesser-known probabilistic orthographic cues to lexical stress. Detection of these kinds of cues likely occurs via a type of implicit learning known as statistical learning (SL). The first part of the tutorial focuses on these points. Next, studies exploring how individual differences in the capacity for SL relate to variability in word reading accuracy in the general population are discussed. A brief overview of research linking impaired SL and dyslexia is also provided. The final part of the tutorial focuses on how we might supplement explicit literacy instruction with implicit learning methods and emphasizes the value of testing the efficacy of new techniques in the classroom. The basic and applied research reviewed here includes corpus analyses, behavioral testing, computational modeling, and classroom-based research. Although some of these methods are not commonly used in clinical research, the depth and breadth of this body of work provide a compelling case for why reading can be thought of as SL and how this view can inform practice.\n\n\nConclusion\nImplicit methods that draw on the principles of SL can supplement the much-needed explicit instruction that helps children learn to read. This synergy of methods has the potential to spark innovative practices in literacy instruction and remediation provided by educators and clinicians to support typical learners and those with developmental disabilities.",

        "abstract": "While research shows that adults attend to both segmental and suprasegmental regularities in speech, including syllabic transitional probabilities as well as stress and intonational patterns, little is known about how statistical learning operates given input from tonal languages. In the current study, we designed an artificial tone language to address several questions: can adults track regularities in a tonal language? Is learning enhanced by previous exposure to tone-marking languages? Does bilingualism affect learning in this task? To address these questions, we contrasted the performance of English monolingual adults (Experiment 1), Mandarin monolingual and Mandarin–English bilingual adults (Experiment 2), and non-tonal bilingual adults (Experiment 3) in a statistical learning task using an artificial tone language. The pattern of results suggests that while prior exposure to tonal languages did not lead to significant improvements in performance, bilingual experience did enhance learning outcomes. This study represents the first demonstration of statistical learning of an artificial tone language and suggests a complex interplay between prior language experience and subsequent language learning.",

Participants learned artificial lexicons (48 words) containing phonologically similar items and were tested on their knowledge in a 4-alternative forced-choice (4AFC) referent-selection task. Lexical stress differences did not reduce confusions between cohort items: KAdazu and kaDAzeI were confused with one another in a 4AFC task and in gaze fixations as often as BOsapeI and BOsapaI. However, lexical stress did affect the relative likelihood of stress-initial confusions when words were embedded in running nonsense speech. Words with medial stress, regardless of initial vowel quality, were more prone to confusions than words with initial stress. The authors concluded that non-initial stress, particularly when wor segmentation is difficult, may serve as \"noise\" that alters lexical learning and lexical access.",

In both experiments, listeners heard unbroken sequences of consonant-vowel syllables, composed of recurring three- and four-syllable \"words.\" These words were demarcated by (a) no cue other than transitional probabilities induced by their recurrence, (b) a consistent left-edge cue, or (c) a consistent right-edge cue. Experiment 1 examined a vowel lengthening cue. All three listener groups benefited from this cue in right-edge position; none benefited from it in left-edge position. Experiment 2 examined a pitch-movement cue. English listeners used this cue in left-edge position, French listeners used it in right-edge position, and Dutch listeners used it in both positions. These findings are interpreted as evidence of both language-universal and language-specific effects. Final lengthening is a language-universal effect expressing a more general (non-linguistic) mechanism. Pitch movement expresses prominence which has characteristically different placements across languages: typically at right edges in French, but at left edges in English and Dutch. Finally, stress realization in English versus Dutch encourages greater attention to suprasegmental variation by Dutch than by English listeners, allowing Dutch listeners to benefit from an informative pitch-movement cue even in an uncharacteristic position.",

However, little is known about how the different acoustic components of stress constrain statistical learning. The current studies were designed to investigate whether intensity and duration each function independently as cues to initial prominence (trochaic-based hypothesis) or whether, as predicted by the Iambic-Trochaic Law (ITL), intensity and duration have characteristic and separable effects on rhythmic grouping (ITL-based hypothesis) in a statistical learning task. Infants were familiarized with an artificial language (Experiments 1 & 3) or a tone stream (Experiment 2) in which there was an alternation in either intensity or duration. In addition to potential acoustic cues, the familiarization sequences also contained statistical cues to word boundaries. In speech (Experiment 1) and non-speech (Experiment 2) conditions, 9-month-old infants demonstrated discrimination patterns consistent with an ITL-based hypothesis: intensity signaled initial prominence and duration signaled final prominence. The results of Experiment 3, in which 6.5-month-old infants were familiarized with the speech streams from Experiment 1, suggest that there is a developmental change in infants' willingness to treat increased duration as a cue to word offsets in fluent speech. Infants' perceptual systems interact with linguistic experience to constrain how infants learn from their auditory environment.",

In the theory of cognitive complexity and control (CCC), Zelazo and Frye argue that preschool children lack the conscious representation and executive functioning needed to solve problems based on conflicting rules. The present study investigates whether the bilingual advantage in control can be found in a nonverbal task, the dimensional change card sort, used by Zelazo and Frye to assess CCC. This problem contains misleading information characteristic of high-control tasks but minimal demands for analysis. Sixty preschool children, half of whom were bilingual, were divided into a group of younger (M = 4,2) and older (M = 5,5) children. All the children were given a test of English proficiency (PPVT-R) and working memory (Visually-Cued Recall Task) to assure comparability of the groups and then administered the dimensional change card sort task and the moving word task. The bilingual children were more advanced than the monolinguals in the solving of experimental problems requiring high levels of control. These results demonstrate the role of attentional control in both these tasks, extends our knowledge about the cognitive development of bilingual children, and provides a means of relating developmental proposals articulated in two different theoretical frameworks, namely, CCC and analysis-control.",

Their use of F0 in single-word utterances was, however, quite different, with the Mandarin speakers having higher maximums and means, and larger ranges, even when only the Mandarin high falling tone was compared with English. In contrast, for a prose passage, the two languages were more similar, differing only in the mean F0, Mandarin again being higher.

            "abstract": "Extending Statistical Learning Farther and Further: Long-Distance Dependencies, and Individual Differences in Statistical Learning and Language Jennifer B. Misyak (jbm36@cornell.edu) Morten H. Christiansen (mhc27@cornell.edu) Department of Psychology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA Abstract language, a clear parallel becomes discernible between successful learning of the artificial languages and those of natural languages. Yet it remains to be fully evidenced whether and to what extent SL and language are subserved by the same underlying mechanism(s). Furthermore, while considerable focus has been placed on the successful learning of dependencies between adjacent linguistic elements, e.g., syllables in words, comparatively less work has addressed the issue of learning nonadjacent relations (for exceptions see Gomez, 2002; Newport & Aslin, 2004; Onnis, Christiansen, Chater & Gomez, 2003). This is an area of decisive importance, as many key relationships between words and constituents are conveyed in long-distance (or remotely connected) structure. In English, for example, linguistic material may intervene between auxiliaries and inflectional morphemes (e.g., is cooking, has traveled) or between subject nouns and verbs in number agreement (e.g., the books on the shelf are dusty). More complex relationships to surface forms are also found in nonadjacent dependencies between antecedents and gaps, such as in wh-questions (e.g., Who did you see __?) and anaphoric reference (e.g., John went to the store where he bought some apples). Indeed, previous work incorporating statistical relations in behaviorism faulted when attempting to account for long-distance dependencies created by the presence of embedded materials. Will SL be consigned to a similar fate, found “guilty by association” or through associative shortcomings of its own? And how does SL relate to language processing more generally? We employ a two-pronged approach to explore the hypothesis that SL and language are integrally interrelated. We first conduct an AGL experiment in which the grammar instantiates farther, more remote statistical relations than has been previously studied—thereby preliminarily testing the viability of SL to succeed in principle where earlier efforts at associationist accounts of language had been deemed to flounder. The detection of long-distance dependencies is thus the focus of our first experiment. We then press further to probe the degree to which SL and language may be empirically linked. Accordingly, our second experiment seeks to determine how individual differences in SL and natural language are interrelated. While statistical learning (SL) and language acquisition have been perceived as intertwined, such a view must contend with theoretical and empirical challenges. Against the backdrop of criticism leveled at early associationist efforts to account for language, a key concern for current SL approaches is whether it may suffice to enable the detection of long-distance relationships akin to those ubiquitously abounding in natural language. In Experiment 1, we extend results from previous work on the learning of nonadjacent dependencies to the learning of long-distance relations spanning three intervening elements; such learning is shown to obtain under two separate contexts. In Experiment 2, we additionally test the strength of SL and language's proposed relatedness by documenting the nature of correlations in individual differences between the two. Both experiments support the thesis that SL may overlap with mechanisms for language, while raising questions as to the singularity or duality of such underlying mechanism(s). Keywords: Statistical Learning; Artificial Grammar Learning; Language Comprehension; Sentence Processing; Individual Differences; Working Memory; IQ Introduction Statistical learning (SL) has been proposed as centrally connected to language acquisition and development. Succinctly defined as the discovery of structure by way of statistical properties of the input, such learning has been characterized as robust and automatic, and has been demonstrated across a variety of both linguistically relevant and general cognition contexts, including speech segmentation (Saffran, Aslin & Newport, 1996), learning the orthographic regularities of written words (Pacton, Perruchet, Fayol & Cleeremans, 2001), visual processing (Fiser & Aslin, 2002), visuomotor learning (Hunt & Aslin, 2001) and non-linguistic, auditory processing (Saffran, Johnson, Aslin & Newport, 1999). But important issues still surround the general scope of SL, especially with respect to how much of complex language structure can be captured by this type of learning. SL research—sometimes also studied as “artificial grammar learning” (AGL) or under the rubric of “implicit learning”—has shown that infant and adult learners, upon brief and passive exposure to sequences generated by an artificial grammar, can incidentally acquire and evince knowledge for the predictive dependencies embedded within the stimuli strings (for reviews, see Gomez & Gerken, 2000; Saffran, 2003). As the instantiation of statistical regularities among stimulus tokens in such grammars commonly mirror the kinds of relations among phonemic, lexical, and phrasal constituents in actual Experiment 1: Statistical Learning of Long- Distance Dependencies Gomez (2002) investigated 18-month-old infants’ and adults’ learning of nonadjacent structure by having them listen to one of two artificial languages (L1 or L2), each of",

Statistical learning allows us to extract and represent these regularities, but how this knowledge is used by the brain during ongoing perception is unclear. We used rapid event-related fMRI to measure hemodynamic responses to individual visual images in a continuous stream that contained sequential contingencies. Sixteen human observers encountered these statistical regularities while performing an unrelated cognitive task, and were unaware of their existence. Nevertheless, the right anterior hippocampus showed greater hemodynamic responses to predictive stimuli, providing evidence for implicit anticipation as a consequence of unsupervised statistical learning. Hippocampal anticipation based on predictive stimuli correlated with subsequent processing of the predicted stimuli in occipital and parietal cortex, and anticipation in additional brain regions correlated with facilitated object recognition as reflected in behavioral priming. Additional analyses suggested that implicit perceptual anticipation does not contribute to explicit familiarity, but can result in predictive potentiation of category-selective ventral visual cortex. Overall, these findings show that future-oriented processing can arise incidentally during the perception of statistical regularities.",

Using a statistical learning paradigm, participants learned words in two novel languages that were based on the International Morse Code. First, participants listened to a continuous stream of words in a Morse code language to test their ability to segment words from continuous speech. Since Morse code does not overlap in form with natural languages, interference from known languages was minimized. Next, participants listened to another Morse code language composed of new words that conflicted with the first Morse code language. Interference in this second language was high due to conflict between languages and due to the presence of two colliding cues (compressed pauses between words and statistical regularities) that competed to define word boundaries. Results suggest that bilingual experience can improve word learning when interference from other languages is low, while inhibitory control ability can improve word learning when interference from other languages is high. We conclude that the ability to extract novel words from continuous speech is a skill that is affected both by linguistic factors, such as bilingual experience, and by cognitive abilities, such as inhibitory control.",

This learning problem might be solved by using distributional cues to word boundaries — for example, by computing the transitional probabilities between sounds in the language input and using the relative strengths of these probabilities to hypothesize word boundaries. The learner might be further aided by language-specific prosodic cues correlated with word boundaries. As a first step in testing these hypotheses, we briefly exposed adults to an artificial language in which the only cues available for word segmentation were the transitional probabilities between syllables. Subjects were able to learn the words of this language. Furthermore, the addition of certain prosodic cues served to enhance performance. These results suggest that distributional cues may play an important role in the initial word segmentation of language learners. q 1996 Academic Press, Inc.",

Three studies are reported that compared the performance of monolingual and bilingual middle-aged and older adults on the Simon task. Bilingualism was associated with smaller Simon effect costs for both age groups; bilingual participants also responded more rapidly to conditions that placed greater demands on working memory. In all cases the bilingual advantage was greater for older participants. It appears, therefore, that controlled processing is carried out more effectively by bilinguals and that bilingualism helps to offset age-related losses in certain executive processes.",

Thomas, 1990). It is questionable whether such enhancement, when it does exist, involves both the acquisition of lexical items and the acquisition of syntactic constructions. This study examined the latter question within a Universal Grammar (UG) parameter-setting model of acquisition, testing matched groups of 17 Unilingual (Ul) versus 15 Multilingual (Ml) adolescent high-school students acquiring English as a second versus third (or fourth) language, respectively. Participants were tested on their acquisition of: (a) specific verbs and their prepositional complements (lexical learning) and (b) preposition stranding (syntactic learning). The Mls outperformed the Uls in both types of acquisition, suggesting that qualities attributed to Mls, that is, heightened metalinguistic skills (J. Thomas, 1988, 1992), enhanced lexical knowledge (J. Thomas, 1988), and a less conservative learning procedure (Zobl, 1992), all help to trigger the setting of UG parameters.",

One hundred twelve English native speaking monolinguals and Spanish-English bilinguals age 5-13 years participated in the study. Language skills were measured by standardized language tests.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe overall results showed that all children implicitly learned statistical regularities above chance level in both modalities. However, there was no group difference between monolingual and bilingual children on either visual or auditory tasks. Lastly, a different tendency in predicting implicit statistical learning was observed for each group. In the monolingual group, both age and language scores significantly explained auditory statistical learning, whereas age explained visual statistical learning. In the bilingual group, age explained auditory statistical learning, and nothing was significant for visual statistical learning.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings are discussed in terms of the extent to which implicit statistical learning is influenced by internal and external factors and a consideration of important notions when testing bilingual children's language skills.",

            "abstract": "The visual environment contains massive amounts of information involving the relations between objects in space and time, and recent studies of visual statistical learning (VSL) have suggested that this information can be automatically extracted by the visual system. The experiments reported in this article explore the automaticity of VSL in several ways, using both explicit familiarity and implicit response-time measures. The results demonstrate that (a) the input to VSL is gated by selective attention, (b) VSL is nevertheless an implicit process because it operates during a cover task and without awareness of the underlying statistical patterns, and (c) VSL constructs abstracted representations that are then invariant to changes in extraneous surface features. These results fuel the conclusion that VSL both is and is not automatic: It requires attention to select the relevant population of stimuli, but the resulting learning then occurs without intent or awareness. The goal of visual processing is to recover information about the structure of the local environment, and what makes this problem difficult is that there is both too little and too much incoming information. The available information is rarely sufficient to definitively infer the structure of the world without making several heuristic assumptions, but at the same time we would be paralyzed if we were perceptually confronted with the massive amount of available sensory input. Thus, visual perception must be selective, and we are consciously aware of only a small part of the visual world at any time. Because the bulk of visual processing occurs beneath the level of awareness, we—as both laypeople and vision scientists—are often surprised at the scope and subtlety of such processing. In this article we explore the nature of a particularly powerful form of unconscious visual processing, concerning the relationships between objects over time. Associative learning of the relationships between objects has played a prominent role in several areas of psychology, but has been less widely explored in the context of human perception and cognition. Interest in this type of learning has flourished in recent years, however, due to the discovery of a novel form of statistical learning. The initial report of statistical learning demonstrated that 8-month-old infants can learn subtle statistical relationships that hold across a sequence of nonsense syllables in a pseudospeech stream (Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996). On the surface, this stream appeared to contain a random sequence of syllables (e.g., \" pi-go-la-bi-ku-ti-.. . , \" in …",

The first two experiments demonstrated that children modified their drawing behavior following specially devised practice in such a way that these modifications could not be viewed as the result of deliberate adaptive strategies. The third experiment showed that these behavioral modifications lasted for at least 1 hr after the training phase. No age-related differences appeared in the experiments. A comparison of children's data with similar adults' data also failed to reveal any age differences. These results provide compelling evidence that implicit learning processes are age independent. Some implications of these results for developmental issues are discussed, notably the hypothesis of the formation of implicit knowledge in the course of learning.",

In Study 1, no overlap in nonword repetition performance was found between a group of 20 school-age children enrolled in language intervention (LI) and a group of 20 age-matched peers developing language normally (LN). In Study 2, a comparison of likelihood ratios for the nonword repetition task and for a traditional language test revealed that nonword repetition distinguished between children independently identified as LI and LN with a high degree of accuracy, by contrast with the traditional language test. Nonword repetition may have considerable clinical utility as a screening measure for language impairment in children. Information on the likelihood ratios associated with all diagnostic tests of language is badly needed.",

We approach this goal by assessing the effects of bilingualism on the executive and orienting networks of attention. In Experiment 1, we compared young bilingual and monolingual adults in a numerical version of the Stroop task, which allowed the assessment of the executive control network. We observed more efficient performance in the former group, which showed both reduced Stroop Interference and larger Stroop Facilitation Effects relative to the latter. Conversely, Experiment 2, conducted with a visual cueing task in order to assess the orienting network, revealed similar Cueing Facilitation and Inhibition (Inhibition of Return – IOR) Effects for both groups of speakers. The implications of the results of these two experiments for the origin and boundaries of the bilingual impact on the attentional system are discussed.",

For a group of 20 simultaneous bilingual (English-Spanish) infants, ages 10 to 30 months, we looked at the patterns of growth in one language in relation to growth in the other and also with respect to growth in both languages combined. The MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (CDI), standardized parent report forms in Spanish and English, provided measures of lexical growth in two languages at varying intervals within the age range. We plotted the two single-language measures, as well as Total and Total Conceptual language measures, across time, referenced on a second γ-axis to the percent of the child's language environment that each language represented. For a subset of the children, we calculated the percentages of general nominals, social words, and verbs for each language to allow the characterization of the children's learning strategies as “referential” or “expressive” (Nelson, 1973). The rate and pace of development were similar to patterns observed in monolinguals. In addition, the vocabulary spurt was seen to occur in about the same percentage of children as has been observed in groups of monolingual children. The bilinguals differed from one another with respect to the relative independence of one language from the other, including the use of different learning strategies in the two languages by the same child.",

            "abstract": "Four experiments are reported in which subjects gained extensive experience with artificial grammars in explicit and implicit processing tasks. Results indicated that (a) implicit processing was sufficient for learning a finite state grammar but was inadequate for learning another type of grammar based on logical rules, (b) Subjects were able to communicate some of their implicit knowledge of the grammars to another person, (c) Consistent with rule induction but not memory array models of learning, verbal protocols indicated there was no tendency to converge on the same set of cues used to identify valid strings, (d) A synergistic learning effect occurred when both implicit and explicit processing tasks were used in the grammar based on logical rules but not in the finite state grammar. A theoretical framework is proposed in which implicit learning is conceptualized as an automatic, memory-based mechanism for detecting patterns of family resemblance among exemplars. Explicit learning mechanisms for discovering and controlling task variables are similar to conscious problem solving. These processes include attempts to form a mental representation of the task, searching memory for knowledge of analogous systems, and attempts to build and test mental models of task performance (Gentner & Stevens, 1983; JohnsonLaird, 1983). Implicit learning is thought to be an alternate mode of learning that is automatic, nonconscious, and more powerful than explicit thinking for discovering nonsalient covariance between task variables (Lewicki, 1986; Reber, 1969, 1976; Reber & Allen, 1978). Demonstrations of implicit learning of artificial grammars typically involve comparisons between groups of subjects who experience exemplars of a grammar under (a) instructions to figure out the rules of the grammar (rule discovery instructions) or (b) instructions that require attention to the exemplars without attempting to determine the rules of the grammar (e.g., groups of subjects asked to memorize the exemplars for a subsequent memory test). Typically, groups of subjects who implicitly learned the grammar do as well or better on subsequent attempts to discriminate between new valid versus invalid strings as subjects who",

        "abstract": "Within a few sentences, listeners learn to understand severely degraded speech such as noise-vocoded speech. However, individuals vary in the amount of such perceptual learning and it is unclear what underlies these differences. The present study investigates whether perceptual learning in speech relates to statistical learning, as sensitivity to probabilistic information may aid identification of relevant cues in novel speech input. If statistical learning and perceptual learning (partly) draw on the same general mechanisms, then statistical learning in a non-auditory modality using non-linguistic sequences should predict adaptation to degraded speech. In the present study, 73 older adults (aged over 60 years) and 60 younger adults (aged between 18 and 30 years) performed a visual artificial grammar learning task and were presented with 60 meaningful noise-vocoded sentences in an auditory recall task. Within age groups, sentence recognition performance over exposure was analyzed as a function of statistical learning performance, and other variables that may predict learning (i.e., hearing, vocabulary, attention switching control, working memory, and processing speed). Younger and older adults showed similar amounts of perceptual learning, but only younger adults showed significant statistical learning. In older adults, improvement in understanding noise-vocoded speech was constrained by age. In younger adults, amount of adaptation was associated with lexical knowledge and with statistical learning ability. Thus, individual differences in general cognitive abilities explain listeners' variability in adapting to noise-vocoded speech. Results suggest that perceptual and statistical learning share mechanisms of implicit regularity detection, but that the ability to detect statistical regularities is impaired in older adults if visual sequences are presented quickly.",

Few researchers have conducted rigorous comparisons across sensory modalities; in particular, the sense of touch has been virtually ignored. The current data reveal not only commonalities but also modality constraints affecting statistical learning across the senses. To be specific, the authors found that the auditory modality displayed a quantitative learning advantage compared with vision and touch. In addition, they discovered qualitative learning biases among the senses: Primarily, audition afforded better learning for the final part of input sequences. These findings are discussed in terms of whether statistical learning is likely to consist of a single, unitary mechanism or multiple, modality-constrained ones.",

The current study examines the extent to which adaptation to time-compressed speech can be impeded by disrupting the continuity of the exposure sentences, and whether this differs between young and older adult listeners when they are equated for starting accuracy. In separate sessions conducted one week apart, the degree of adaptation was assessed in four exposure conditions, all of which involved exposure to the same number of time-compressed sentences. A continuous exposure condition involved presentation of the time-compressed sentences without interruption. Two alternation conditions alternated time-compressed speech and uncompressed speech by single sentences or groups of four sentences. A fourth condition presented sentences that were separated by a period of silence but no uncompressed speech. For all conditions, neither young nor older adults' overall level of learning was influenced by disruptions to the exposure sentences. In addition, participants' performance showed reliable improvement across the first and subsequent sessions. These results support robust learning mechanisms in speech perception that remain functional throughout the lifespan.",

To study age-related changes in perceptual learning, the authors tested young and older adults' ability to adapt to degraded speech. First, the authors showed that older adults, when equated for starting accuracy with young adults, adapted at a rate and magnitude comparable to young adults. However, unlike young adults, older adults failed to transfer this learning to a different speech rate and did not show additional benefit when practice exceeded 20 sentences. Listeners did not adapt to speech degraded by noise, indicating that adaptation to time-compressed speech was not attributable to task familiarity. Finally, both young and older adults adapted to spectrally shifted noise-vocoded speech. The authors conclude that initial perceptual learning is comparable in young and older adults but maintenance and transfer of this learning decline with age.",

This points to the need for proper stimulus coding in order for learning of multiple stimuli to occur. We examined the stimulus coding rules for learning with multiple stimuli. Our results demonstrate that: (1) stimulus rhythm is necessary for temporal patterning to take effect during practice; (2) learning consolidation is subject to disruption by roving up to 4 h after each practice session; (3) importantly, after completion of temporal-patterned learning, performance is undisrupted by extended roving training; (4) roving is ineffective if each stimulus is presented for five or more consecutive trials; and (5) roving is also ineffective if each stimulus has a distinct identity. We propose that for multi-stimulus learning to occur, the brain needs to conceptually “tag” each stimulus, in order to switch attention to the appropriate perceptual template. Stimulus temporal patterning assists in tagging stimuli and switching attention through its rhythmic stimulus sequence.",

            "abstract": "Visual perceptual learning models, as constrained by orientation and location specificities, propose that learning either reflects changes in V1 neuronal tuning or reweighting specific V1 inputs in either the visual cortex or higher areas. Here we demonstrate that, with a training-plus-exposure procedure, in which observers are trained at one orientation and either simultaneously or subsequently passively exposed to a second transfer orientation, perceptual learning can completely transfer to the second orientation in tasks known to be orientation-specific. However, transfer fails if exposure precedes the training. These results challenge the existing specific perceptual learning models by suggesting a more general perceptual learning process. We propose a rule-based learning model to explain perceptual learning and its specificity and transfer. In this model, a decision unit in high-level brain areas learns the rules of reweighting the V1 inputs through training. However, these rules cannot be applied to a new orientation/location because the decision unit cannot functionally connect to the new V1 inputs that are unattended or even suppressed after training at a different orientation/location, which leads to specificity. Repeated orientation exposure or location training reactivates these inputs to establish the functional connections and enable the transfer of learning.",

Contrary to this, we suggest that older adults'; changing performance reflects memory search demands, which escalate as experience grows. A series of simulations show how the performance patterns observed across adulthood emerge naturally in learning models as they acquire knowledge. The simulations correctly identify greater variation in the cognitive performance of older adults, and successfully predict that older adults will show greater sensitivity to fine-grained differences in the properties of test stimuli than younger adults. Our results indicate that older adults'; performance on cognitive tests reflects the predictable consequences of learning on information-processing, and not cognitive decline. We consider the implications of this for our scientific and cultural understanding of aging.",

Two hypotheses are examined: modification of early cortical representations versus task-specific selective reweighting. Representation modification seems neither functionally necessary nor implied by the available psychophysical and physiological evidence. Computer simulations and mathematical analyses demonstrate the functional and empirical adequacy of selective reweighting as a perceptual learning mechanism. The stimulus images are processed by standard orientation- and frequency-tuned representational units, divisively normalized. Learning occurs only in the \"read-out\" connections to a decision unit; the stimulus representations never change. An incremental Hebbian rule tracks the task-dependent predictive value of each unit, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio of their weighted combination. Each abrupt change in the environmental statistics induces a switch cost in the learning curves as the system temporarily works with suboptimal weights.",

Such functions might aid in developing cochlear models, and cochlear coordinates could provide potentially useful spectral transforms of speech and other acoustic signals. In 1961, an almost-exponential function was developed (Greenwood, 1961b, 1974) by integrating an exponential function fitted to a subset of frequency resolution-integration estimates (critical bandwidths). The resulting frequency-position function was found to fit cochlear observations on human cadaver ears quite well and, with changes of constants, those on elephant, cow, guinea pig, rat, mouse, and chicken (Békésy, 1960), as well as in vivo (behavioral-anatomical) data on cats (Schucknecht, 1953). Since 1961, new mechanical and other physiological data have appeared on the human, cat, guinea pig, chinchilla, monkey, and gerbil. It is shown here that the newer extended data on human cadaver ears and from living animal preparations are quite well fit by the same basic function. The function essentially requires only empirical adjustment of a single parameter to set an upper frequency limit, while a \"slope\" parameter can be left constant if cochlear partition length is normalized to 1 or scaled if distance is specified in physical units. Constancy of slope and form in dead and living ears and across species increases the probability that the function fitting human cadaver data may apply as well to the living human ear. This prospect increases the function's value in plotting auditory data and in modeling concerned with speech and other bioacoustic signals, since it fits the available physiological data well and, consequently (if those data are correct), remains independent of, and an appropriate means to examine, psychoacoustic data and assumptions.",

Practice improved humans' ability to distinguish sounds regardless of the training regimen. However, progressively trained subjects were more accurate and showed more generalization, despite significantly less training with the stimuli that were the most difficult to distinguish. Rats showed less capacity to improve with practice but still benefited from progressive training. These findings indicate that transitioning from an easier to a more difficult task during training can facilitate, and in some cases may be essential for, auditory perceptual learning. The results are not predicted by an explanation that assumes interaction of generalized excitation and inhibition but are consistent with a hierarchical account of perceptual learning in which the representational precision required to distinguish stimuli determines the mechanisms engaged during learning.",

        "abstract": "Statistical learning refers to the ability to identify structure in the input based on its statistical properties. For many linguistic structures, the relevant statistical features are distributional: They are related to the frequency and variability of exemplars in the input. These distributional regularities have been suggested to play a role in many different aspects of language learning, including phonetic categories, using phonemic distinctions in word learning, and discovering non-adjacent relations. On the surface, these different aspects share few commonalities. Despite this, we demonstrate that the same computational framework can account for learning in all of these tasks. These results support two conclusions. The first is that much, and perhaps all, of distributional statistical learning can be explained by the same underlying set of processes. The second is that some aspects of language can be learned due to domain-general characteristics of memory.",

            "title": "From the Cover: Statistical learning of new visual feature combinations by infants",
            "abstract": "Present theories of high-level vision posit that object recognition is based on internal representations of complex features stored in extrastriate cortical areas (1–4), and that these features are constrained by mechanisms at the level of retinal ganglion cells (5) and striate cortex simple cells (6) which are tuned optimally to explore statistical regularities in the visual input. However, it is not clear what process governs the selection and learning of complex features, specific views (7), or object-parts (8) that serve as the canonical building blocks for representing the higher-order structure of objects. It has been proposed that any effective associative learning of higher-order visual features requires access to the predictability of one element's appearance in the presence of another element, i.e., the conditional probabilities between image elements (9, 10). In the absence of such information, the observer will be unable to differentiate the actual underlying structure of scenes from meaningless coincidences. However, there has not been a demonstration that human infants could rely on conditional probabilities of image elements in developing complex visual representations of their environment. \n \nWe tested 9-month-old infants in three experiments by using a habituation paradigm to determine whether they naturally extract statistics from unknown scenes that would allow them to develop new higher-order representations efficiently. In each experiment, infants first were familiarized to a series of scenes, each composed of 3 elements of a pool of 12 colored geometric shapes (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). Eight of the elements were grouped into two horizontal and two vertical pairs (base pairs), so that the elements within pairs always appeared together in a fixed spatial relationship. Four elements were “noise” elements, in that they appeared without a fixed spatial relationship to any other element. Each scene consisted of one base pair and one noise element placed within an invisible 2 by 2 grid. Each noise element was assigned to one particular base pair, so that the noise element and the related base pair always appeared together, but in one of four different spatial relationships within the available locations of the grid. Thus, there were a total of 16 possible scenes repeated many times in random order during the habituation phase. Each scene was presented for 2 sec in a looming format to maximize the infants' interest (11). The scenes were composed of arbitrary shapes in a regular layout rather than multipart nonsense objects or sets of Gabor stimuli to avoid any interference between preexisiting mechanisms sensitive to low-level attributes (e.g., orientation) or Gestalt principles (e.g., proximity or shape-similarity) and our goal of measuring the statistical relationships between elements (12). Because the infant could easily discriminate between the elements in the scenes, which appeared many times, only the higher-order structure of element cooccurrences could serve as relevant information for representing the scenes. \n \n \n \nFig 1. \n \nStimulus elements and scenes used in the experiments. (a) The twelve shapes were grouped into four base pairs and four noise elements, with each noise element appearing with only one base pair. (b) The four possible scenes created by one base pair and ... \n \n \n \nOnce each infant was habituated, as indexed by a predetermined criterion of decline in looking time to the display, the test phase began. For the test, two base pairs and two non-base pairs were selected randomly for each infant. The non-base pairs consisted of one element of a base pair and the corresponding noise element that appeared with that pair. The base and non-base test pairs were presented in a standard posthabituation test phase to assess looking times to these two types of test pairs. A significant difference in looking time signaled that the infant could discriminate the base pair from the non-base pair.",

Few researchers have conducted rigorous comparisons across sensory modalities; in particular, the sense of touch has been virtually ignored. The current data reveal not only commonalities but also modality constraints affecting statistical learning across the senses. To be specific, the authors found that the auditory modality displayed a quantitative learning advantage compared with vision and touch. In addition, they discovered qualitative learning biases among the senses: Primarily, audition afforded better learning for the final part of input sequences. These findings are discussed in terms of whether statistical learning is likely to consist of a single, unitary mechanism or multiple, modality-constrained ones.",

Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that a conditioned response made on the basis of an appetitive reinforcer was diminished when conditioning and testing occurred in different contexts, but that aversive conditioning was not influenced by the context in which testing occurred. In Experiment 4, the presence of an aversive reinforcer during training did not preclude the occurrence of context-specific conditioning on the basis of an appetitive reinforcer.

            "abstract": "A simulation model of episodic memory, MINERVA 2, is applied to the learning of concepts, as represented by the schema-abstraction task. The model assumes that each experience produces a separate memory trace and that knowledge of abstract concepts is derived from the pool of episodic traces at the time of retrieval. A retrieval cue contacts all traces simultaneously, activating each according to its similarity to the cue, and the information retrieved from memory reflects the summed content of all activated traces responding in parallel. The MINERVA 2 model is able to retrieve an abstracted prototype of the category when cued with the category name and to retrieve and disambiguate a category name when cued with a category exemplar. The model successfully predicts basic findings from the schema-abstraction literature (e.g., differential forgetting of prototypes and old instances, typicality, and category size effects), including some that have been cited as evidence against exemplar theories of concepts. The model is compared to other classification models, and its implications regarding the abstraction problem are discussed. How is abstract knowledge related to specific experience? In present-day terms, this question concerns the relationship between episodic and generic memories. This article explores the possibility that there is only one memory system, which stores episodic traces, and that abstract knowledge as such does not have to be stored but can be derived from the pool of traces of specific experiences at the time of retrieval. I demonstrate how this might work by applying a simulation model of a multipletrace memory theory to the sehema-abstraction experimental paradigm, which is widely believed to capture in the laboratory the processes by which generic or abstract ideas are formed. Multiple-trace theories assume that each event to which one attends gives rise to its own memory trace. Thus, repetition of an item such as a word in a list does not strengthen a prior representation (i.e., one predating the experiment or one laid down by the item's first experimental occurrence); rather, it produces a new trace that coexists in memory with traces of other occurrences of the same item. Experiments supporting the multiple-trace assumption have been primarily concerned with the ability of subjects to remember an item's presentation frequency, list membership, presentation modality, exposure duration, serial position, and so forth (e.g., Hintzman, 1976; Hintzman & Block, 1971; Hintzman, Block, & Summers, 1973;",

The authors investigated variability in the effect sizes (i.e., the magnitude of the difference between children with and without SLI) across studies and its relation to several factors: type of nonword repetition task, age of SLI sample, and nonword length.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe authors searched computerized databases and reference sections and requested unpublished data to find reports of nonword repetition tasks comparing children with and without SLI.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChildren with SLI exhibited very large impairments in nonword repetition, performing an average (across 23 studies) of 1.27 standard deviations below children without SLI. A moderator analysis revealed that different versions of the nonword repetition task yielded significantly different effect sizes, indicating that the measures are not interchangeable. The second moderator analysis found no association between effect size and the age of children with SLI. Finally, an exploratory meta-analysis found that children with SLI displayed difficulty repeating even short nonwords, with greater difficulty for long nonwords.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings have potential to affect how nonword repetition tasks are used and interpreted, and suggest several directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Linguistic stress and sequential statistical cues to word boundaries interact during speech segmentation in infancy. However, little is known about how the different acoustic components of stress constrain statistical learning. The current studies were designed to investigate whether intensity and duration each function independently as cues to initial prominence (trochaic-based hypothesis) or whether, as predicted by the Iambic-Trochaic Law (ITL), intensity and duration have characteristic and separable effects on rhythmic grouping (ITL-based hypothesis) in a statistical learning task. Infants were familiarized with an artificial language (Experiments 1 & 3) or a tone stream (Experiment 2) in which there was an alternation in either intensity or duration. In addition to potential acoustic cues, the familiarization sequences also contained statistical cues to word boundaries. In speech (Experiment 1) and non-speech (Experiment 2) conditions, 9-month-old infants demonstrated discrimination patterns consistent with an ITL-based hypothesis: intensity signaled initial prominence and duration signaled final prominence. The results of Experiment 3, in which 6.5-month-old infants were familiarized with the speech streams from Experiment 1, suggest that there is a developmental change in infants' willingness to treat increased duration as a cue to word offsets in fluent speech. Infants' perceptual systems interact with linguistic experience to constrain how infants learn from their auditory environment.",

There was a total of eight manipulations for each expression. In the other, the three suprasegmental variables were exchanged between the two alternative meanings of an expression, yielding a total of eight manipulations for each expression. Results from the two studies were consistent in showing that listeners use all three cues, and just these three to parse such utterances. That is, it was possible to completely shift the meaning of an expression uttered with one meaning into its alternate meaning by exchanging all three variables. In both studies, the effects of duration pattern and pitch contour were additive in total proportion correct.

In this paper, we examine a plausible mechanism for the acquisi- tion of the relative order of heads and complements. We hypothesize that the iambic-trochaic law determines the physical realization of main prominence within phonological phrases that contain more than one word: if it is realized mainly through pitch and intensity, it is in a phonological phrase that is stress- initial and has a complement-head structure, otherwise it is in a phonological phrase that is stress-final and has a head-complement structure. We show this to be the case both across languages (French and Turkish), and within a lan- guage (German, where both orders of head and complement are found). Our finding allows us to consider a psychologically plausible mechanism for the acquisition of the relative order of heads and complements, one of the basic properties of syntax. Because the mechanism is based on auditory percep- tion, it can be utilized before any knowledge of words, thus accounting for the flawlessness in infants' first words combinations.",

It is unclear, though, how infants learn to attend to stress as a cue to word segmentation. This series of experiments was designed to explore infants' attention to conflicting cues at different ages. Experiment 1 replicated previous findings: When stress and statistical cues indicated different word boundaries, 9-month-old infants used syllable stress as a cue to segmentation while ignoring statistical cues. However, in Experiment 2, 7-month-old infants attended more to statistical cues than to stress cues. These results raise the possibility that infants use their statistical learning abilities to locate words in speech and use those words to discover the regular pattern of stress cues in English. Infants at different ages may deploy different segmentation strategies as a function of their current linguistic experience.",

Spectrograms were used to determine the vowel duration and intensity ratios which occur in these words and this information was applied in making up a test in which listeners' judgments of stress could be correlated with variations in the duration and intensity ratios. The results of the experiments show that duration and intensity ratios are both cues for judgments of stress and that, in the material studied, duration ratio is a more effective cue than intensity ratio.",

The present experiments investigate whether listeners exhibit dimension-based statistical learning of correlations between acoustic dimensions defining perceptual space for a given speech segment. While engaged in a word recognition task guided by a perceptually unambiguous voice-onset time (VOT) acoustics to signal beer, pier, deer, or tear, listeners were exposed incidentally to an artificial \"accent\" deviating from English norms in its correlation of the pitch onset of the following vowel (F0) to VOT. Results across four experiments are indicative of rapid, dimension-based statistical learning; reliance on the F0 dimension in word recognition was rapidly down-weighted in response to the perturbation of the correlation between F0 and VOT dimensions. However, listeners did not simply mirror the short-term input statistics. Instead, response patterns were consistent with a lingering influence of sensitivity to the long-term regularities of English. This suggests that the very acoustic dimensions defining perceptual space are not fixed and, rather, are dynamically and rapidly adjusted to the idiosyncrasies of local experience, such as might arise from nonnative-accent, dialect, or dysarthria. The current findings extend demonstrations of \"object-based\" statistical learning across speech segments to include incidental, online statistical learning of regularities residing within a speech segment.",

We examined the sufficiency of this hypothesis and its implications for development by implementing a statistical learning mechanism in a computational model based on a mixture of Gaussians (MOG) architecture. Statistical learning alone was found to be insufficient for phonetic category learning--an additional competition mechanism was required in order for the categories in the input to be successfully learnt. When competition was added to the MOG architecture, this class of models successfully accounted for developmental enhancement and loss of sensitivity to phonetic contrasts. Moreover, the MOG with competition model was used to explore a potentially important distributional property of early speech categories--sparseness--in which portions of the space between phonetic categories are unmapped. Sparseness was found in all successful models and quickly emerged during development even when the initial parameters favoured continuous representations with no gaps. The implications of these models for phonetic category learning in infants are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Over the course of the first year of life, infants develop from being generalized listeners, capable of discriminating both native and non-native speech contrasts, into specialized listeners whose discrimination patterns closely reflect the phonetic system of the native language(s). Recent work by Maye, Werker and Gerken (2002) has proposed a statistical account for this phenomenon, showing that infants may lose the ability to discriminate some foreign language contrasts on the basis of their sensitivity to the statistical distribution of sounds in the input language. In this paper we examine the process of enhancement in infant speech perception, whereby initially difficult phonetic contrasts become better discriminated when they define two categories that serve a functional role in the native language. In particular, we demonstrate that exposure to a bimodal statistical distribution in 8-month-old infants' phonetic input can lead to increased discrimination of difficult contrasts. In addition, this exposure also facilitates discrimination of an unfamiliar contrast sharing the same phonetic feature as the contrast presented during familiarization, suggesting that infants extract acoustic/phonetic information that is invariant across an abstract featural representation.",

The effect is characterized by a warping of perceptual space near phonemic category centers. Previous explanations have been formulated within the theoretical framework of cognitive psychology. The model proposed in this paper builds on research from both psychology and neuroscience in working toward a more complete account of the effect. The model embodies two principal hypotheses supported by considerable experimental and theoretical research from the neuroscience literature: (1) sensory experience guides language-specific development of an auditory neural map, and (2) a population vector can predict psychological phenomena based on map cell activities. These hypotheses are realized in a self-organizing neural network model. The magnet effect arises in the model from language-specific nonuniformities in the distribution of map cell firing preferences. Numerical simulations verify that the model captures the known general characteristics of the magnet effect and provides accurate fits to specific psychophysical data.",

The acoustic correlates, which are based on relative measures, were tested on a corpus of 233 polysyllabic words, each of which was spoken once by two males and two females. For the most part, the appropriate distinctions are made by the chosen acoustic properties for features. However, for each property, there was some overlap in the acoustic correlates of features for the sounds being distinguished. An examination of the sounds in the overlap regions reveals that their surface manifestation varies substantially from the canonical form. In large part, the observed variability can be explained in terms of changes due to feature spreading and lenition.",

Toscano (joseph-toscano@uiowa.edu) University of Iowa, Department of Psychology, E11 SSH Iowa City, IA 52242 USA Bob McMurray (bob-mcmurray@uiowa.edu) University of Iowa, Department of Psychology and Iowa Center for Developmental and Learning Sciences, E11 SSH Iowa City, IA 52242 USA Abstract learns the number of categories in the input and their statis- tical distributions, reflecting the developmental trajectory of speech category formation in the process. This demonstrates that unsupervised statistical learning mechanisms are able to describe how infants can acquire these categories. However, many critical aspects of this process have yet to be addressed. In particular, acoustic analyses have revealed that most phonemic distinctions are marked by multiple cues. Lisker (1978) cites that there are at least 16 acoustic cues that distinguish voiced and voiceless sounds in word-medial po- sition in English. Existing models of statistical learning and speech sound category acquisition are insufficient to describe how listeners learn multiple cue distributions and integrate these cues when perceiving speech. These challenges are also not limited to understanding speech development and percep- tion. Similar difficulties would be encountered when trying to combine multiple features in other domains as well. Can statistical learning approaches be extended to capture listeners’ use of multiple acoustic cues? How could this prob- lem be instantiated in a model of speech sound categoriza- tion? One way would be to present each cue along a separate dimension, as in Figure 1B, leading to n-dimensional cate- gories, where n is the number of cues to be learned. This type of model has the advantage of allowing us to fully represent the acoustic space. However, it can also lead to computational complexity (representing a 16-dimensional category for the cues to voicing), and it would present the learner with a sparse space from which to extract the categories, since many of the possible combinations of cues would never be heard. An alternative approach would be to weight and combine sets of cues that lie along the same phonetic dimension, as shown in Figure 1C. Cues to voicing, for example, are not orthogonal; they each indicate the same category structure: voiced or voiceless for English. Indeed, they are similar to visual cues to depth that observers integrate during percep- tion to determine the three-dimensional structure of objects (Jacobs, 2002). Thus, it is possible to integrate them into a single phonological dimension upon which the relevant cat- egories can be learned. This approach reduces the computa- tional complexity of the problem, and it can be expanded to account for a large number of acoustic cues. This paper seeks to address several questions about how sets of multiple cues can be learned: A great deal of behavioral evidence suggests that infants can use distributional statistics to learn speech sound categories. Recently, a number of computational approaches have demon- strated the feasibility of statistical learning by showing that the distributional statistics of linguistically-relevant acoustic cues can be learned in an unsupervised way. However, speakers and listeners use a large number of acoustic cues to distinguish phonetic categories, and it is not clear how multiple cues are combined during perception. We propose a model of speech sound category acquisition that learns the distributions of mul- tiple cues that lie along the same dimension and combines them. We demonstrate that the model is able to account for trading relations between cues (an indicator of the size of the effect of each cue) for word-initial voicing contrasts in English. Keywords: speech perception; speech development; mixture of Gaussians; cue integration; statistical learning. Introduction The sound systems of human languages vary greatly. One of the first steps in language acquisition is for infants to deter- mine the sound structure of their native language. In a given language, phonetically-relevant acoustic cues are distributed such that they tend to cluster into categories. For example, voice-onset time (VOT; the delay between the opening of the vocal tract and the onset of vocal energy) values in English tend to cluster into voiced and voiceless categories, near 0 and 50 ms, respectively (Lisker & Abramson, 1964). Thus, the distributional statistics of this cue contains information about the voicing categories of English. Previous work has demonstrated that infants can track these distributional statistics and use this information to learn categories (Maye, Werker, & Gerken, 2002). Recently, re- searchers have begun to use computational models to under- stand this process more deeply. These models have been used to describe how learning unfolds over development and leads to stable speech sound categories. One way to model this process is to represent each phonetic category (such as voiced or voiceless) as a Gaussian distri- bution, providing us with a representation that corresponds to the frequency distribution of an acoustic cue. McMurray, Aslin, and Toscano (in press) present a model that uses this approach. Figure 1A shows how the model might represent the VOT distribution of English. It contains two categories, one centered at the mean of the voiced VOT values and the other centered at the mean of the voiceless values. The model",

Charles St. Baltimore, MD 21218 Introduction VvzV VksV A fairly large body of work within the artificial grammar paradigm has provided some reason to believe that statistical learning may be easy and rapid in both adult and infant subjects (e.g. Newport and Aslin, 2004; Wilson, 2003; Peperkamp et al., 2003). However, there are indications that domain and task may be very critical determiners of learnability. Factors such as degree of explicit knowledge in learning, strength of native language bias, and computational complexity of the data sample seem likely to play a role as well. In the work presented here, subjects were exposed to a lexicon of novel words that exhibited a co-occurrence restriction of some type. Experiment 1 imposed a phonotactic constraint of within cluster voicing assimilation (VCCV word forms). Experiment 2 trained subjects on a (non-explicit) suffix alternation conditioned by the identity of the final stem consonant (CVCV-CV word forms). 2.2 was designed to test the hypothesis that the identity relation (CVzV-zi) may be necessary to bootstrap learning in this domain. CVzV-zi CVvV-zi CVgV-zi CVvV-zi Results & Conclusions Subjects failed to learn in experiments 1.1,1.2, and 2.2, and demonstrated successful learning in experiment 2.1 (for both old and new forms). These results suggest that learning of novel linguistic distributions based on co- occurrence statistics may be more difficult to induce than previously supposed: that the computational device may be quite limited in the number of units it can keep track of, that a highly salient identity relation may be necessary to focus attention on potential structure, etc. Further work will be needed to fully disentangle the contributions of each of these factors. Methods All trials consisted of a pre-test, training, and post-test portion. The pre-test and post-test task was a two- alternative forced choice paradigm which asked subjects to choose which of two auditorily presented tokens was a word in the made-up exposure language (one alternative was grammatical and one ungrammatical according to the particular alternation). Exposure consisted of approximately 20 minutes of auditorily presented word tokens from one of the following data distributions.

This includes both a preliminary review and an extension of this review to provide ten tips for educators to enhance the statistical learning of non-specialists in statistics. The tips are intended to provide a constructive approach to the review process through safeguarding educators, including dissertation supervisors, and learners, from being misled by some of the shortcomings that I have identified in this book. It is in this sense that I refer to these tips as “remedial tips”. As such, these tips should not be regarded as exhaustive in their own right in reflecting the statistical learning needs of non-specialists. Nevertheless, one of the important responsibilities professionally trained statisticians face in the teaching of statistics to non-specialists is that of empowering learners to stem the tide of misuse of statistics within their own disciplines, and one of the corresponding challenges is that of identifying published material that is potentially unhelpful and even counterproductive in achieving this goal. Thus, it is also my intention that these tips will be of broader pedagogical value as a handy reference, including for those uninitiated teachers of statistics to non-specialists who may be tempted to reach out for a pocket guide to support them in balancing the demands of teaching and research in an effort to make statistics less mystifying to their students.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Much has been written on the learning needs of dyslexic and dyscalculic students in primary and early secondary education. However, it is not clear that the necessary disability support staff and specialist literature are available to ensure that these needs are being adequately met within the context of learning statistics and general quantitative skills in the self-directed learning environments encountered in higher education. This commentary draws attention to dyslexia and dyscalculia as two potentially unrecognized conditions among undergraduate medical students and in turn, highlights key developments from recent literature in the diagnosis of these conditions. With a view to assisting medical educators meet the needs of dyscalculic learners and the more varied needs of dyslexic learners, a comprehensive list of suggestions is provided as to how learning resources can be designed from the outset to be more inclusive. A hitherto neglected area for future research is also identified through a call for a thorough investigation of the meaning of statistical literacy within the context of the undergraduate medical curriculum.",

P-curve is the distribution of statistically significant p values for a set of studies (ps < .05). Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves-containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p values--only right-skewed p--curves are diagnostic of evidential value. By telling us whether we can rule out selective reporting as the sole explanation for a set of findings, p-curve offers a solution to the age-old inferential problems caused by file-drawers of failed studies and analyses.",

            "abstract": "Outlier removal is common in hormonal research. Here we investigated to what extent removing outliers in hormonal data leads to divergent statistical conclusions. We first show that the most common outlier detection rule is based on a number of standard deviations (SD) from the mean. Next, we used simulations to examine the degree to which statistical conclusions diverge when a test with outlier exclusion yields a statistically significant result whereas the test with outlier inclusion did not, or vice versa (at p = .05). Simulations were run in duplicate for independent samples t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA designs, and based on real testosterone (T) data and a theoretical gamma distribution of T data. We ran simulations for different sample sizes (30 to 100) and outlier removal rules (2.5 SD and 3 SD). For significant t-tests, we found that in between 14 % to 55 % of the significant cases a test with outlier exclusion yielded a statistically significant result whereas the test with outlier inclusion did not, or vice versa (median p difference: .03–.06). For significant repeated measures ANOVAs, we found that in between 7 % to 28 % of significant cases a test where outlier exclusion yielded a statistically significant result whereas the test with outlier inclusion did not, or vice versa (median p difference: .01–.03). When reporting any test that would lead to a statistically significant result (either the test with inclusion or exclusion of outliers (or both)), in between 5.15 % and 6.89 % of the independent sample t-tests were statistically significant, and for the repeated measures ANOVA design this was between 6.32 % and 7.62 % of the tests. Our results suggest that outlier handling can have a substantial impact on significance testing. We suggest several potential solutions for handling outliers and we argue for a careful assessment of handling outliers in hormonal data.",

            "abstract": "Background: Adolescents’ health choices have been widely researched, but the ethical basis of these choices, namely their rights, duties, and responsibilities, have been disregarded and scale is required to measure these. Objective: To describe the development of a scale that measures adolescents’ rights, duties, and responsibilities in relation to health choices and document the preliminary scale testing. Research design: A multi-phase development method was used to construct the Health Rights Duties and Responsibilities (HealthRDR) scale. The concepts and content were defined through document analysis, a systematic literature review, and focus groups. The content validity and clarity of the items were evaluated by expert panel of 23 adolescents, school nurses, and researchers. We calculated the content validity index and the content validity ratio at on item and scale levels. Preliminary testing was conducted with 200 adolescents aged 15–16 years. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s alpha correlation, and statistics for the item-analysis were calculated. Ethical considerations: Ethical approval and permission were obtained according to national legislation and responsible research practice was followed. Informed consent was obtained from the participants and the parents were informed about the study. Findings: The Health Rights Duties and Responsibilities scale comprises of four sub-scales with 148 items: 15 on health choices, 36 on rights, 47 on duties, and 50 on responsibilities. The items had a 0.93 content validity index and a 0.85 content validity ratio. Cronbach’s alpha correlation coefficient was 0.99 for the total scale and the individual sub-scales scores were health choices (0.93), rights (0.97), responsibilities (0.99), and duties (0.98). Discussion: The findings are discussed in light of the ethical concepts and validity and reliability of the developed scale. Conclusion: The Health Rights Duties and Responsibilities scale defines and understands adolescents’ rights, duties, and responsibilities in relation to health choices and has good content validity. Further testing and refinement of the concepts are needed.",

Schroeder, Anthony Shook Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, 2240 Campus Drive Evanston, IL 60208 USA Abstract semantic level. Increased flexibility in either of these processes would allow for accelerated vocabulary acquisition in bilinguals, leading to rapid gains in novel language knowledge. Vocabulary learning is particularly important in attaining language fluency; by some estimates learners need to know 98% of the words they hear to comprehend speech which translates to roughly 8000 lexical items (Nation, 2006). The size of vocabularies means that many words are acquired incidentally, either by reading or listening to speech (Schmitt, 2008). Words acquired from speech are notoriously difficult to learn, in part because the boundaries between words are not always obvious. One way to overcome the word boundary problem is to attend to the regularities in speech. Sounds that co-occur often are likely to comprise part of a single word, whereas rare sound sequences are likely to mark transitions between words. These transitions can mark the beginning of novel words, which should be attended to and encoded by the learner. Infants demonstrate attention to statistical probabilities in a continuous auditory sequence (Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996), as do adults (Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, & Newport, 1999), and this skill has been associated with word-learning ability (Mirman, Magnuson, Estes, & Dixon, 2008). It is a flexible process that can be applied to successfully learn words composed of speech phonemes, musical tones, or visual sequences (Saffran, et al., 1999; Slemmer, Kirkham, & Johnson, 2010), and may reflect the process by which language learners acquire words from spoken speech. A potential difficulty during novel language acquisition remains, though, in that the novel language is prone to interference from already known languages. Interaction between languages is observed during language processing and can lead to interference (Bijeljac-Babic, Biardeau, & Grainger, 1997; Blumenfeld & Marian, 2007; Duyck, Assche, Drieghe, & Hartsuiker, 2007; Marian & Spivey, 2003a; 2003b; Schwartz & Kroll, 2006; van Heuven, Dijkstra, & Grainger, 1998). In the process of acquiring a new language, interference from known languages may be particularly destructive, as known languages are highly practiced and may activate more easily. Better suppression of non-target language activation may consequently improve attention to novel language cues and facilitate acquisition. Inhibitory control ability is one way to manage this interference, by reducing activation of irrelevant items. Strong inhibitory control has been associated with improved statistical learning in situations where interference during learning was particularly pronounced (Weiss, Gerfen, & Mitchel, 2010). Bilinguals display advantages in inhibitory We examine the influence of bilingualism and inhibitory control on the ability to learn a novel language. Using a statistical learning paradigm, participants learned transitional probabilities in two novel languages based on the International Morse Code. First, participants listened to a low- interference language to test word segmentation skill. Next, participants listened to a high-interference language, in which a colliding cue to word boundaries in the form of compressed pauses between words conflicted with the language’s transitional probabilities. Results suggest that high proficiency in a second language can improve word learning in a novel language, but when interference during learning is high, language experience no longer confers a benefit and strong inhibitory control ability is necessary for learning to occur. Keywords: recognition language acquisition; bilingualism; pattern Introduction Language learning is a complex phenomenon that requires the learner to incorporate novel phonology, vocabulary, and grammatical rules. Not surprisingly, acquiring a new language can be difficult, particularly later in life, and many learners never achieve full native-like proficiency (Birdsong, 2006; 2009; DeKeyser, 2005). Learning outcomes may be improved by identifying the processes that contribute to successful acquisition of a novel language. One of the first steps to language acquisition is to understand the way in which sounds are combined to create words. After identifying novel sound sequences, they can be assigned to semantic concepts and the complete word added to one’s vocabulary. Here we consider how two related factors, bilingual language experience and inhibitory control, may influence this word acquisition process. Bilingualism has been shown to provide a language learning advantage, and bilinguals acquiring a third language outperform monolinguals acquiring a second language (Cenoz & Valencia, 1994; Kaushanskaya & Marian, 2009a; 2009b; Keshavarz & Astaneh, 2004; Sanz, 2000; Thomas, 1992). This may be due in part to bilinguals’ enhanced working memory, which allows them to sustain novel words in the focus of attention until they can be encoded in long-term memory (Papagno & Vallar, 1995; van Hell & Mahn, 1997), and is linked to high second- language proficiency (Majerus, Poncelet, van der Linden, & Weekes, 2008; Service, Simola, Metsanheimo, & Maury, 2002). These novel words may be more readily linked to novel sound sequences at the phonological level, or mapped onto concepts shared with translation equivalents at the",

Smith 2 , Lisa Gershkoff-Stowe 1 Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences 1 , Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences 2 Indiana University, IN 47405 USA Abstract Previous research indicates that adult learners are able to use co-occurrence information to learn word-to-object mappings and form object categories simultaneously. The current eye- tracking study investigated the dynamics of attention allocation during concurrent statistical learning of words and categories. The results showed that the participants’ learning performance was associated with the numbers of short and mid-length fixations generated during training. Moreover, the learners’ patterns of attention allocation indicated online interaction and bi-directional bootstrapping between word and category learning processes. Keywords: Eye-tracking; statistical learning; word learning; category learning. Introduction Over the past few decades, researchers have found that humans are sensitive to statistical regularities in the environment. People are able to use statistical information in non-linguistic tasks, such as making inferences (e.g., Xu & Denison, 2009) or finding predictive features of complex visual scenes (e.g., Fiser & Aslin, 2001). They can use statistical information in linguistic tasks as well, such as learning phonetic distributions (e.g., Maye et al., 2002), word boundaries (e.g., Saffran et al. 1996b), word and meaning mappings (e.g., Smith & Yu, 2008), and rudimentary syntax (e.g., Gomez & Gerken, 1999). These studies suggest that statistical learning is a domain-general ability in human cognition. An earlier cross-linguistic study conducted in our laboratory (Chen et al., 2009) also showed that adult English and Mandarin speakers were able to use co- occurrence information to learn word-to-object mappings and to form object categories at the same time. However, even though these two groups of learners had comparable performance in learning word-to-object mappings, they showed different levels of sensitivity to the cues associated with category learning. Participants were better at learning the types of regularities that were present in their native language than the ones that were incongruent with their linguistic input. In Experiment 1 of the study, objects from the same category had similar attached object parts and their labels ended with the same final syllable. This syllable-to- category association simulated a prevalent linguistic feature in Mandarin in that the final syllables of object names often indicated category membership. The results showed that Mandarin speakers were able to learn individual word-to- object mappings and to form syllable-to-category associations under cross-situational learning contexts. On the other hand, English speakers tended not to use the final syllables of labels as cues in category learning. In Experiment 2 of that study, the category markers were moved to the beginning of labels to simulate a more frequent feature in English (e.g., the adjectives in noun phrases). As the structures of the training stimuli were more congruent with the input in the naturalistic environment, the English speakers’ category learning performance became significantly better. More importantly, they also had better performance in the word learning task. One possible explanation of the improvement of word learning performance is that category learning bootstraps word learning. That is, learning which objects belong to the same category helps the learners to focus on relevant features of the stimuli and to rule out certain distractors as possible referents of a word. However, from the design of that study, we were not able to draw a conclusive link between the English speakers’ success in forming categories and their improvement in word learning. The present study was designed to address this issue by using eye-tracking techniques. Category learning studies using eye-tracking techniques have shown that learners generally attend to all possible dimensions early in learning. But during the process of learning, they gradually shift their attention to relevant dimensions (e.g., Rehder & Hoffman, 2005; Blair et al., 2009). Based on previous studies, similar patterns might be observed in statistical word learning and category learning. Our prediction is that at the beginning of training, learners will pay attention to all objects on the screen when hearing a word. Across learning, they will gradually tune their attention to the most probable referent of a word. Moreover, after successfully forming a few word- to-object mappings, the learners should notice that the objects (and their labels) can be grouped into different categories, each having its own distinctive feature. After establishing primitive category structures, the learners should then use this information to rule out certain distractors as possible referents of a word. The goals of the current study are to examine the dynamics of attention allocation in statistical learning of words and categories and to investigate the real-time interaction between word learning and category formation.

These theories make differing predictions about the degree of flexibility with which attention can be deployed in response to stimulus properties. Results from 2 eye-tracking studies show that humans can rapidly learn to differently allocate attention to members of different categories. These results provide the first unequivocal demonstration of stimulus-responsive attention in a categorization task. Furthermore, the authors found clear temporal patterns in the shifting of attention within trials that follow from the informativeness of particular stimulus features.

            "abstract": "“Less is More” in Bayesian word segmentation: When cognitively plausible learners outperform the ideal Lawrence Phillips (lawphill@uci.edu) Department of Cognitive Sciences, 2235 SBSG Irvine, CA 92697 USA Lisa Pearl (lpearl@uci.edu) Department of Cognitive Sciences, 2314 SBSG Irvine, CA 92697 USA addition, GGJ conducted an ideal learner analysis, which assumes unlimited processing and memory resources for the learner. PGS investigated the impact of this assumption, finding a limited ―Less is More‖ effect (Newport 1990) where cognitive resource limitations help, rather than hinder, some Bayesian learners. We examine the effect of the phoneme assumption in addition to these cognitive resource assumptions. We find not only that syllable-based Bayesian learners can do well at word segmentation but also a much more robust ―Less is More‖ effect in our constrained Bayesian learners. This suggests that the unit of representation for models of language acquisition plays a crucial role. Here, using more cognitively plausible assumptions showcases a surprising learning effect, the ―Less is More‖ effect that has been hypothesized to explain language acquisition success in children. Abstract Purely statistical models have accounted for infants’ early ability to segment words out of fluent speech, with Bayesian models performing best (Goldwater et al. 2009). Yet these models often incorporate unlikely assumptions, such as infants having unlimited processing and memory resources and knowing the full inventory of phonemes in their native language. Following Pearl, et al. (2011), we explore the impact of these assumptions on Bayesian learners by utilizing syllables as the basic unit of representation. We find a significant ―Less is More‖ effect (Pearl et al 2011; Newport 1990) where memory and processing constraints appear to help, rather than hinder, performance. Further, this effect is more robust than earlier results and we suggest this is due a relaxing of the assumption of phonemic knowledge, demonstrating the importance of basic assumptions such as unit of representation. We argue that more cognitively plausible assumptions improve our understanding of language acquisition. Keywords: language acquisition; Bayesian modeling; cognitively plausible learning; less is more; statistical learning; word segmentation The syllables as the representational unit The first evidence that infants possess categorical representations of syllabic units appears at 3 months: Eimas (1999) finds that infants have categorical representations of syllables whereas infants at this age have no categorical representation of phonemes. Since word segmentation first occurs around 7.5 months (Jusczyk & Aslin 1995), it is likely that infants have robust access to syllables at this age. In contrast, knowledge of phonemes does not occur until approximately 10 months (Werker & Tees 1984) making it unlikely the learner has adult knowledge of their native language phonemes during the initial stages of word segmentation. Although it is possible that word segmentation and phoneme learning bootstrap from one another, we consider a more conservative approach which assumes infants only have access to syllabic information. While the success of previous statistical word segmentation models is heartening, how dependent is their success on the assumption of the phoneme as a representational unit? With this question in mind, we modify existing phoneme-based statistical models of word segmentation that use Bayesian inference (GGJ, PGS) to operate over syllables. All of our modified Bayesian learners treat syllables as atomic units in the same way phonemes are thought of as atomic units. This mimics the performance of infants who are able to discriminate between syllables such as /ba/, /bu/, and /lu/, but who are unable to Introduction Knowledge of words plays a crucial role in language acquisition but requires a child to identify words out of fluent speech. Children seem to accomplish this word segmentation very early (~7.5 months (Jusczyk & Aslin 1995; Echols et al. 1997; Jusczyk et al., 1993a)), and therefore many strategies have been proposed for this early success. One popular explanation for initial language learning relies purely on distributional information, rather than language-specific biases. This idea is bolstered by findings that infants keep track of the statistical regularities in speech (Saffran et al. 1996), and because languages vary greatly in their cues to word boundaries which would weaken the use of language specific knowledge. One very successful, purely distributional, learning approach uses Bayesian inference (Goldwater, Griffith & Johnson 2009 (GGJ), Pearl, Goldwater & Steyvers 2011 (PGS)). However, these Bayesian models incorporate modeling assumptions that are unlikely to be true. Both have assumed that the basic unit of representation available to the infant is the phoneme. We will argue from experimental evidence that syllables (or syllable-like representations) are a more natural representation for infants at this stage of acquisition. In",

            "abstract": "Abstract Three studies investigated the perception of rhythmic units in speech to explore the potential role of rhythm in word-level segmentation. Experiment 1 investigated whether adults expect trochaic (strong–weak) units to cohere. The prediction that poststress pauses, which violated the coherence of the trochee, would be unexpected and therefore more noticeable was supported: Subjects were consistently more likely to identify post- than prestress pauses in trisyllabic speech stimuli. In Experiment 2, a variant of a head-turn preference procedure was used to test a similar question with 7- and 9-month-old infants. Nine-month olds showed a significant preference for stimuli in which the coherence of the trochee was preserved, suggesting that they perceived those stimuli as more natural than stimuli in which trochaic sequences were disrupted by pauses. Among 7-month olds, no preferences were observed. A third experiment tested the possibility that 9-month olds use the trochaic stress pattern in word-level segmentation. Subjects distinguished a trochaic sequence that had previously been embedded in a four-syllable string from a novel trochaic sequence, suggesting that they recognized the previously heard trochaic unit as familiar. No such discrimination was present for iambic targets and distracters, suggesting that infants failed to recognize the previously heard iambic sequence.",

        "abstract": "Speech and music are highly redundant communication systems, with multiple acoustic cues signaling the existence of perceptual categories. This redundancy makes these systems robust to the influence of noise, but necessitates the development of perceptual strategies: listeners need to decide the importance to place on each source of information. Prior empirical work and modeling has suggested that cue weights primarily reflect within-task statistical learning, as listeners assess the reliability with which different acoustic dimensions signal a category and modify their weights accordingly. Here we present evidence that perceptual experience can lead to changes in cue weighting which extend across tasks and across domains, suggesting that perceptual strategies reflect both global biases and local (i.e. task-specific) learning. In two experiments, native speakers of Mandarin (N=45)—where pitch is a crucial cue to word identity—placed more importance on pitch and less importance on other dimensions compared to native speakers of non-tonal languages English (N=45) and Spanish (N=27), during the perception of both second language speech and musical beats. In a third experiment, we further show that Mandarin speakers are better able to attend to pitch and ignore irrelevant variation in other dimensions compared to English and Spanish speakers, and even struggle to ignore pitch when asked to attend to other dimensions. Thus, an individual’s idiosyncratic auditory perceptual strategies reflect a complex mixture of congenital predispositions, task-specific learning, and biases instilled by extensive experience in making use of important dimensions in their native language.",

There was a total of eight manipulations for each expression. In the other, the three suprasegmental variables were exchanged between the two alternative meanings of an expression, yielding a total of eight manipulations for each expression. Results from the two studies were consistent in showing that listeners use all three cues, and just these three to parse such utterances. That is, it was possible to completely shift the meaning of an expression uttered with one meaning into its alternate meaning by exchanging all three variables. In both studies, the effects of duration pattern and pitch contour were additive in total proportion correct.

However, recent reports indicate a gradient of performance across non-native contrasts, ranging from near-chance to near-ceiling. Current theoretical models argue that such variations reflect systematic effects of experience with phonetic properties of native speech. The present research addressed predictions from Best's perceptual assimilation model (PAM), which incorporates both contrastive phonological and noncontrastive phonetic influences from the native language in its predictions about discrimination levels for diverse types of non-native contrasts. We evaluated the PAM hypotheses that discrimination of a non-native contrast should be near-ceiling if perceived as phonologically equivalent to a native contrast, lower though still quite good if perceived as a phonetic distinction between good versus poor exemplars of a single native consonant, and much lower if both non-native segments are phonetically equivalent in goodness of fit to a single native consonant. Two experiments assessed native English speakers' perception of Zulu and Tigrinya contrasts expected to fit those criteria. Findings supported the PAM predictions, and provided evidence for some perceptual differentiation of phonological, phonetic, and nonlinguistic information in perception of non-native speech. Theoretical implications for non-native speech perception are discussed, and suggestions are made for further research.",

        "abstract": "The development of speech perception shows a dramatic transition between infancy and adulthood. Between 6 and 12 months, infants' initial ability to discriminate all phonetic units across the world's languages narrows—native discrimination increases while non-native discrimination shows a steep decline. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine whether brain oscillations in the theta band (4–8 Hz), reflecting increases in attention and cognitive effort, would provide a neural measure of the perceptual narrowing phenomenon in speech. Using an oddball paradigm, we varied speech stimuli in two dimensions, stimulus frequency (frequent vs. infrequent) and language (native vs. non-native speech syllables) and tested 6-month-old infants, 12-month-old infants, and adults. We hypothesized that 6-month-old infants would show increased relative theta power (RTP) for frequent syllables, regardless of their status as native or non-native syllables, reflecting young infants' attention and cognitive effort in response to highly frequent stimuli (“statistical learning”). In adults, we hypothesized increased RTP for non-native stimuli, regardless of their presentation frequency, reflecting increased cognitive effort for non-native phonetic categories. The 12-month-old infants were expected to show a pattern in transition, but one more similar to adults than to 6-month-old infants. The MEG brain rhythm results supported these hypotheses. We suggest that perceptual narrowing in speech perception is governed by an implicit learning process. This learning process involves an implicit shift in attention from frequent events (infants) to learned categories (adults). Theta brain oscillatory activity may provide an index of perceptual narrowing beyond speech, and would offer a test of whether the early speech learning process is governed by domain-general or domain-specific processes.",

The authors criticize, in particular, what they see as an over-emphasis of the role of temporal speech envelope information, and an over-emphasis of entrainment to the input rhythm while neglecting the role of top-down processes in modulating the entrainment of neuronal oscillations.

Four-month-old, English-only, hearing infants discriminated an ASL handshape distinction, while 14-month-old hearing infants did not. Fourteen-month-old ASL-learning infants, however, did discriminate the handshape distinction, suggesting that, as in heard language, exposure to seen language is required for maintenance of visual language discrimination.

Two experiments with 8-month-old infants examined the use of absolute and relative pitch cues in a tone-sequence statistical learning task. The results suggest that, given unsegmented stimuli that do not conform to the rules of musical composition, infants are more likely to track patterns of absolute pitches than of relative pitches. A 3rd experiment tested adults with or without musical training on the same statistical learning tasks used in the infant experiments. Unlike the infants, adult listeners relied primarily on relative pitch cues. These results suggest a shift from an initial focus on absolute pitch to the eventual dominance of relative pitch, which, it is argued, is more useful for both music and speech processing.",

Recent work by Maye, Werker and Gerken (2002) has proposed a statistical account for this phenomenon, showing that infants may lose the ability to discriminate some foreign language contrasts on the basis of their sensitivity to the statistical distribution of sounds in the input language. In this paper we examine the process of enhancement in infant speech perception, whereby initially difficult phonetic contrasts become better discriminated when they define two categories that serve a functional role in the native language. In particular, we demonstrate that exposure to a bimodal statistical distribution in 8-month-old infants' phonetic input can lead to increased discrimination of difficult contrasts. In addition, this exposure also facilitates discrimination of an unfamiliar contrast sharing the same phonetic feature as the contrast presented during familiarization, suggesting that infants extract acoustic/phonetic information that is invariant across an abstract featural representation.",

In this study we created a new and highly detailed age-specific unbiased average head template in a standard MNI152-like infant coordinate system for healthy, typically developing 6-month-old infants by performing linear normalization, diffeomorphic normalization and iterative averaging processing on 60 subjects’ structural images. The resulting age-specific average templates in a standard MNI152-like infant coordinate system demonstrate sharper anatomical detail and clarity compared to existing infant average templates and successfully retains the average head size of the 6-month-old infant. An example usage of the average infant templates transforms magnetoencephalography (MEG) estimated activity locations from MEG’s subject-specific head coordinate space to the standard MNI152-like infant coordinate space. We also created a new atlas that reflects the true 6-month-old infant brain anatomy. Average templates and atlas are publicly available on our website (http://ilabs.washington.edu/6-m-templates-atlas).",

Eight-month-old infants, however, do not appear to benefit from the presence of regular relations between words and objects. Adults, like 8-month-olds, did not benefit from regular audio-visual correspondences when they were tested with tones, rather than linguistic input. These differences in learning outcomes across age and input suggest that both developmental and stimulus-based constraints affect statistical learning.",

First, I propose that the presence of communicative intentions can be recognized in others' behaviour before the content of these intentions is accessed or inferred. Second, I claim that such recognition can be achieved by decoding specialized ostensive signals. Third, I argue on empirical bases that, by decoding ostensive signals, human infants are capable of recognizing communicative intentions addressed to them. Thus, learning about actual modes of communication benefits from, and is guided by, infants' preparedness to detect infant-directed ostensive communication.",

We showed pairs of monkey faces producing two different vocalizations to 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-month-old infants and asked whether they would prefer to look at the corresponding face when they heard one of the two vocalizations. Only the two youngest groups exhibited intersensory matching, indicating that perceptual narrowing is pan-sensory and a fundamental feature of perceptual development.",

Many previous studies document a decline in nonnative phonetic perception between 6 and 12 months of age. However, much less experimental attention has been paid to developmental change in native-language phonetic perception over the same time period. We hypothesized that language experience in the first year facilitates native-language phonetic performance between 6 and 12 months of age. We tested 6-8- and 10-12-month-old infants in the United States and Japan to examine native and nonnative patterns of developmental change using the American English /r-l/ contrast. The goals of the experiment were to: (a) determine whether facilitation characterizes native-language phonetic change between 6 and 12 months of age, (b) examine the decline previously observed for nonnative contrasts and (c) test directional asymmetries for consonants. The results show a significant increase in performance for the native-language contrast in the first year, a decline in nonnative perception over the same time period, and indicate directional asymmetries that are constant across age and culture. We argue that neural commitment to native-language phonetic properties explains the pattern of developmental change in the first year.",

As learning ensues, the power of statistical information subsides and a reliance on learned categories emerges. We posited that phonetic processing is anchored by two strategies that shift during development: statistical learning during the initial stage before phonetic categories are acquired, and learned categories during adulthood when categories are fully formed. We examined whether the strategy transition could be indexed using cortical brain rhythms (theta) that reflect cognitive effort. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) we examined theta in response to native and nonnative speech sounds at 6–8 months, 10–12 months, and adulthood. Several advances in MEG analysis were required to test infants. Supporting our hypothesis, the results revealed that theta power increases for frequent stimuli, regardless of language, at 6–8 months....",

Participants played a computer game in which they navigated through a three-dimensional space while responding to animated characters encountered along the way. Characters' appearances in the game correlated with distinctive sound category distributions, exemplars of which repeated each time the characters were encountered. As the game progressed, the speed and difficulty of required tasks increased and characters became harder to identify visually, so quick identification of approaching characters by sound patterns was, although never required or encouraged, of gradually increasing benefit. After 30 min of play, participants performed a categorization task, matching sounds to characters. Despite not being informed of audio-visual correlations, participants exhibited reliable learning of these patterns at posttest. Categorization accuracy was related to several measures of game performance and category learning was sensitive to category distribution differences modeling acoustic structures of speech categories. Category knowledge resulting from the game was qualitatively different from that gained from an explicit unsupervised categorization task involving the same stimuli. Results are discussed with respect to information sources and mechanisms involved in acquiring complex, context-dependent auditory categories, including phonetic categories, and to multi-modal statistical learning.",

In these studies, AX-discrimination tasks purportedly reveal that discriminability of speech sounds from a single category varies with judged phonetic \"goodness\" of the sounds. However, one possible confound is that category membership is determined by identification of sounds in isolation, whereas, discrimination tasks include pairs of stimuli. In the first experiment of the current study, identification and goodness judgments were obtained for vowels (/i/-/e/) presented in pairs. A substantial shift in phonetic identity was evidenced with changes in the context vowel. In a second experiment, listeners participated in an AX-discrimination task with the vowel pairs from the first experiment. Using the contextual identification functions from the first experiment, predictions of discriminability were calculated using the classic tenets of Categorical Perception. Obtained discriminability functions were well accounted for by predictions from identification. There was no additional unexplained variance that required the proposal of \"perceptual magnets.\" These results suggest that PME may be nothing more than further demonstration that general discriminability is greater for cross-category stimulus pairs than for within-category pairs.",

This paper investigates the effects of two different kinds of training on auditory perceptual space. It is first shown that categorization training using nonspeech stimuli, in which subjects learn to identify stimuli within a particular frequency range as members of the same category, can lead to a decrease in sensitivity to stimuli in that category. This phenomenon is an example of acquired similarity and apparently has not been previously demonstrated for a category-relevant dimension. Discrimination training with the same set of stimuli was shown to have the opposite effect: subjects became more sensitive to differences in the stimuli presented during training. Further experiments investigated some of the conditions that are necessary to generate the acquired similarity found in the first experiment. The results of these experiments are used to evaluate two neural network models of the perceptual magnet effect. These models, in combination with our experimental results, are used to generate an experimentally testable prediction concerning changes in the brain's auditory maps under different training conditions.",

In most instances, these brief stimuli also contain sufficient information for vowel indentification. Stimulus continua in which formant transitions ranged from values appropriate to [b], [d], [g] in various vowel environments, and in which stimulus durations were 20 and 46 ms, yielded categorical labeling functions with a few exceptions.

            "abstract": "For stimuli modeling stop consonants varying in the acoustic correlates of voice onset time (VOT), human listeners are more likely to perceive stimuli with lower f0's as voiced consonants--a pattern of perception that follows regularities in English speech production. The present study examines the basis of this observation. One hypothesis is that lower f0's enhance perception of voiced stops by virtue of perceptual interactions that arise from the operating characteristics of the auditory system. A second hypothesis is that this perceptual pattern develops as a result of experience with f0-voicing covariation. In a test of these hypotheses, Japanese quail learned to respond to stimuli drawn from a series varying in VOT through training with one of three patterns of f0-voicing covariation. Voicing and f0 varied in the natural pattern (shorter VOT, lower f0), in an inverse pattern (shorter VOT, higher f0), or in a random pattern (no f0-voicing covariation). Birds trained with stimuli that had no f0-voicing covariation exhibited no effect of f0 on response to novel stimuli varying in VOT. For the other groups, birds' responses followed the experienced pattern of covariation. These results suggest f0 does not exert an obligatory influence on categorization of consonants as [VOICE] and emphasize the learnability of covariation among acoustic characteristics of speech.",

Participants became sensitive to several temporal-order statistics, both rapidly and with no overt task or explicit instructions. Sequences of shapes presented during familiarization were distinguished from novel sequences of familiar shapes, as well as from shape sequences that were seen during familiarization but less frequently than other shape sequences, demonstrating at least the extraction of joint probabilities of 2 consecutive shapes. When joint probabilities did not differ, another higher-order statistic (conditional probability) was automatically computed, thereby allowing participants to predict the temporal order of shapes. Results of a single-shape test documented that lower-order statistics were retained during the extraction of higher-order statistics. These results suggest that observers automatically extract multiple statistics of temporal events that are suitable for efficient associative learning of new temporal features.",

In addition to making predictions for normal human adults, the theory makes specific predictions for children, elderly people, and patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, major depression, amnesia, or lesions of the prefrontal cortex. Two separate formal descriptions of the theory are also provided. One describes trial-by-trial learning, and the other describes global dynamics.

It is so called because it assumes relatively weak constraints both on the articulatory gestures and on the auditory patterns that map phonological elements. This approach views speech production and perception as distinct but cooperative systems. Like the motor theory of speech perception, double-weak theory accepts that phonological units are modified by context in ways that are important to perception. It further agrees that many aspects of such context dependency have their origin in natural articulatory processes. However, double-weak theory sides with proponents of auditory theories of phonetics by accepting that the real-time objects of perception are well-defined auditory patterns. Because speakers find ways to \"orderly\" output conditions\" (Sussman et al., 1995), listeners are able to successfully decode speech using relatively simple pattern-recognition mechanisms. It is suggested that this situation has arisen through a stylization of gestural patterns to accommodate real-time limits of the perceptual system. Results from a new perceptual experiment, involving a four-dimensional stimulus continuum and a 10-category/hVC/response set, are shown to be largely compatible with this framework.",

The results of those experiments can be simplified if it is assumed that each consonant has a characteristic and fixed frequency position, or locus, for the second formant, corresponding to the relatively fixed place of production of the consonant. On that basis, the transitions may be regarded as “movements” from the locus to the steady state of the vowel.The experiments reported in this paper provide additional evidence concerning the existence and positions of these second‐formant loci for the voiced stops, b, d, and g. There appears to be a locus for d at 1800 cps and for b at 720 cps. A locus for g can be demonstrated only when the adjoining vowel has its second formant above about 1200 cps; below that level no g locus was found.The results of these experiments indicate that, for the voiced stops, the transition cannot begin at the locus and go from there to ...",

Rather than focusing on the speech signal per se, ETLA considers the infant’s multi‐sensory exposure to the phonetic, prosodic, syntactic and semantic characteristics along with visual, tactile, olfative and other sensory information as a key to the spontaneous emergence of linguistic structure early in life—a structure implicit in the adults use of the language, and that is partly simplified by the infant’s limited production, perception and representation capacities.

        "abstract": "Disparity in suicide rates across various metropolitan areas in the US is growing. Besides personal genomics and pre-existing mental health conditions affecting individual-level suicidal behaviors, contextual factors are also instrumental in determining region-/community-level suicide risk. However, there is a lack of quantitative approach to model the complex associations and interplays of the socio-environmental factors with the regional suicide rates. In this paper, we propose a holistic data-driven framework to model the associations of socio-environmental factors (demographic, socio-economic, and climate) with the suicide rates, and compare the key socio-environmental determinants of suicides across the large and medium/small metros of the vulnerable US states, leveraging a suite of advanced statistical learning algorithms. We found that random forest outperforms all the other models in terms of both in-sample goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample predictive accuracy, which is then used for statistical inferencing. Overall, our findings show that there is a significant difference in the relationships of socio-environmental factors with the suicide rates across the large and medium/small metropolitan areas of the vulnerable US states. Particularly, suicides in medium/small metros are more sensitive to socio-economic and demographic factors, while that in large metros are more sensitive to climatic factors. Our results also indicate that non-Hispanics, native Hawaiian or Pacific islanders, and adolescents aged 15-29 years, residing in the large metropolitan areas, are more vulnerable to suicides compared to those living in the medium/small metropolitan areas. We also observe that higher temperatures are positively associated with higher suicide rates, with large metros being more sensitive to such association compared to that of the medium/small metros. Our proposed data-driven framework underscores the future opportunities of using big data analytics in analyzing the complex associations of socio-environmental factors and inform policy actions accordingly.",

The existing energy-economy paradigms used to characterize the long-term trends in the energy sector do not adequately account for climate variability and change. In this paper, we propose a multi-paradigm framework for estimating the climate sensitivity of end-use energy demand that can easily be integrated with the existing energy-economy models. To illustrate the applicability of our proposed framework, we used the energy demand and climate data in the state of Indiana to train a Bayesian predictive model. We then leveraged the end-use demand trends as well as downscaled future climate scenarios to generate probabilistic estimates of the future end-use demand for space cooling, space heating and water heating, at the individual household and building level, in the residential and commercial sectors. Our results indicated that the residential load is much more sensitive to climate variability and change than the commercial load. Moreover, since the largest fraction of the residential energy demand in Indiana is attributed to heating, future warming scenarios could lead to reduced end-use demand due to lower space heating and water heating needs. In the commercial sector, the overall energy demand is expected to increase under the future warming scenarios. This is because the increased cooling load during hotter summer months will likely outpace the reduced heating load during the more temperate winter months.",

All U.S. counties and county-equivalent entities are assigned to one of six levels (four metropolitan and two nonmetropolitan) based on: 1) their February 2013 Office of Management and Budget designation as metropolitan, micropolitan, or noncore; 2) for metropolitan counties, the population size of the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) to which they belong; and 3) for counties in MSAs of 1 million or more, the location of principal city populations within the MSA. The 2013 and 2006 NCHS schemes were applied to data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to illustrate differences in selected health measures by urbanization level and to assess the magnitude of differences between estimates from the two schemes.\n\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\nCounty urban-rural assignments under the 2013 NCHS scheme are very similar to those under the 2006 NCHS scheme. Application of the updated scheme to NVSS and NHIS data demonstrated the continued usefulness of the six categories for assessing and monitoring health differences among communities across the full urbanization spectrum. Residents of large central and large fringe metro counties differed substantially on many health measures, illustrating the importance of continuing to separate these counties. Residents of large fringe metro counties generally fared better than residents of less urban counties. Estimates obtained from the 2013 and 2006 schemes were similar.",

The 'lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.",

Increasing numbers of young children now present to the emergency department (ED) with mental health issues, and ED personnel must determine the most appropriate disposition options for these children, sometimes without the assistance of specialty mental health services. Much of the present body of literature describing suicidality fails to separate children from adolescents for analysis and discussion. This article reviews relevant literature pertaining to suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young children and discusses problems with available data, as well as epidemiology, risk factors, typical motivations, methods, assessment, and disposition for these patients. Suicidal children younger than 12 years are often clinically different from suicidal adolescents and adults and may require unique assessment and disposition strategies in the ED. A child who has ideation without a clear plan, or has made an attempt of low lethality, can sometimes be discharged home, provided that a supportive, responsible caregiver is willing to monitor the child and take him or her to outpatient mental health appointments. If the home environment is detrimental, or the child has used a method of high potential lethality, inpatient treatment is the most appropriate course of action. Mental health specialty services, when available, should be used to help determine the most appropriate disposition.",

The Office of Management and Budget's delineation of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties forms the foundation of the scheme. The NCHS scheme also uses the cut points of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Codes to subdivide the metropolitan counties based on the population of their metropolitan statistical area (MSA): large, for MSA population of 1 million or more; medium, for MSA population of 250,000-999,999; and small, for MSA population below 250,000. Large metro counties were further separated into large central and large fringe metro categories using classification rules developed by NCHS. Nonmetropolitan counties were assigned to two levels based on the Office of Management and Budget's designated micropolitan or noncore status. The 2006 scheme was applied to data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to illustrate its ability to capture health differences by urbanization level.\n\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\nApplication of the 2006 NCHS scheme to NVSS and NHIS data shows that it identifies important health disparities among communities, most notably those for inner city and suburban communities. The design of the NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties makes it particularly well-suited for assessing and monitoring health differences across the full urbanization continuum.",

        "abstract": "Aims: High frequency words are read more quickly and accurately than low frequency words, a phenomenon called the frequency effect. In the current study, we examine several possible predictors for explaining individual differences between bilinguals in their sensitivity to frequency in the second language: specific second language exposure and vocabulary; general language abilities (therefore also evident in native language performance); and general cognitive ability (non-linguistic sensitivity to regularities). Approach: We used an individual differences approach with unbalanced Hebrew–English bilinguals, two typologically different languages that do not share a writing system, which allows a clear discrimination between native language and second language exposure and vocabulary. Data and analysis: To examine frequency effects, 69 Hebrew–English bilingual adults completed lexical decision tasks in native language and second language. In addition, participants completed vocabulary tests in both languages, reported language use and proficiency, and performed a statistical learning task. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Findings: The results demonstrated that only vocabulary knowledge in the second language was a significant predictor of frequency effects in the second language. In addition, neither sensitivity to frequency in the native language nor statistical learning ability (a measure of general sensitivity to regularities) predicted sensitivity to frequency in the second language. Originality: Using an individual differences approach with bilinguals of two typologically different languages that do not share a writing system allows us to distinguish between native language and second language proficiency, and therefore identify the unique contribution of predictive factors from each of the languages to efficient visual word recognition in second language. Implications: The current findings support the lexical entrenchment hypothesis and highlight the importance of testing a variety of bilingual populations.",

Ten years later, they were administered measures of exposure to print, reading comprehension, vocabulary, and general knowledge. First-grade reading ability was a strong predictor of all of the 11th-grade outcomes and remained so even when measures of cognitive ability were partialed out. First-grade reading ability (as well as 3rd- and 5th-grade ability) was reliably linked to exposure to print, as assessed in the 11th grade, even after 11th-grade reading comprehension ability was partialed out, indicating that the rapid acquisition of reading ability might well help develop the lifetime habit of reading, irrespective of the ultimate level of reading comprehension ability that the individual attains. Finally, individual differences in exposure to print were found to predict differences in the growth in reading comprehension ability throughout the elementary grades and thereafter.",

Experiments 1 and 2 revealed larger frequency effects, and larger semantic priming effects in naming, with unpointed print than with pointed print. In Experiments 3 and 4 subjects were presented with Hebrew consonantal strings that were followed by vowel marks appearing at stimulus onset asynchronies ranging from 0 ms (simultaneous presentation) to 300 ms from the onset of consonant presentation. Subjects were inclined to wait for the vowel marks to appear even though the words could be named uneqUIvocally using lexical phonology. These results suggest that prelexical phonology is the default strategy for readers in shallow orthographies, providing strong support for the ODH.",

Semantic constraint effects were larger in production than in reading. Frequency effects were larger in production than in reading without constraining context but larger in reading than in production with constraining context. Bilingual disadvantages were modulated by frequency in production but not in eye fixation times, were not smaller in low-constraint contexts, and were reduced by high-constraint contexts only in production and only at the lowest level of English proficiency. These results challenge existing accounts of bilingual disadvantages and reveal fundamentally different processes during lexical access across modalities, entailing a primarily semantically driven search in production but a frequency-driven search in comprehension. The apparently more interactive process in production than comprehension could simply reflect a greater number of frequency-sensitive processing stages in production.",

However, little is known about the role of the specific language combination of the bilinguals. To investigate this issue, the authors administered a word identification task (progressive demasking) on 1,025 monosyllabic English (L2) words to native speakers of French, German, and Dutch. A regression approach was adopted, including a large number of within- and between-language variables as predictors. A substantial overlap of reaction time patterns was found across the groups of bilinguals, showing that word recognition results obtained for one group of bilinguals generalize to bilinguals with different mother tongues. Moreover, among the set of significant predictors, only one between-language variable was present (cognate status); all others reflected characteristics of the target language. Thus, although influences across languages exist, word recognition in L2 by proficient bilinguals is primarily determined by within-language factors, whereas cross-language effects appear to be limited. An additional comparison of the bilingual data with a native control group showed that there are subtle but significant differences between L1 and L2 processing.",

They also completed a syntactic priming task, which provided a dynamic index of children's facility to detect and respond to changes in the input frequency of linguistic structure. The results showed that implicit statistical learning ability was directly associated with the long-term maintenance of the primed structure. The results constitute the first empirical demonstration of a direct association between implicit statistical learning and syntactic acquisition in children.",

For the present study, Chinese first language-English L2 children were given standardized measures of vocabulary, grammar and global comprehension every year from 4 ½ to 6 ½ years of English in school (ages 8½ to 10½); language environment factors were obtained through an extensive parent questionnaire. Children converged on monolingual norms differentially according to the test, with the majority of children reaching monolingual levels of performance on the majority of tests by 5 ½ years of English exposure. Individual differences in outcomes were predicted by length of English exposure, mother's education, mother's English fluency, child's use of English in the home, richness/quality of the English input outside school and age of arrival in Canada. In sum, the timeframe for bilinguals to catch up to monolinguals depends on linguistic sub-domain, task difficulty and on individual children's language environment, making 4-6 years an approximate estimate only. This study also shows that language environment factors shape not only early-stage but also late-stage bilingual development.",

        "title": "Case, Word Order, and Language Learnability: Insights from Connectionist Modeling",
        "abstract": "Case, Word Order, and Language Learnability: Insights from Connectionist Modeling Gary Lupyan (il24@cornell.edu) Morten H. Christiansen (mhc27@cornell.edu) Department of Psychology Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853 USA Abstract How does the existence of case systems, and strict word order patterns a↵ect the learnability of a given language? We present a series of connectionist sim- ulations, suggesting that both case and strict word order may facilitate syntactic acquisition by a se- quential learning device. Our results are consis- tent with typological data concerning the frequen- cies with which di↵erent type of word order pat- terns occur across the languages of the world. Our model also accommodates patterns of syntactic de- velopment across several di↵erent languages. We conclude that non-linguistic constraints on general sequential-learning devices may help explain the re- lationship between case, word order, and learnabil- ity of individual languages. Introduction In language acquisition, children are faced with many formidable tasks, yet they normally acquire most of their native language within the first five years of life. One of the most difficult of these tasks involves mapping a sequence of words onto some sort of interpretation of what that sequence is supposed to mean. That is, in order for the child to under- stand a sentence, she needs to determine the gram- matical roles of the individual words so that she can work out who did what to whom. Although the chil- dren appear to bring powerful statistical learning mechanisms to bear on the acquisition tasks (e.g., Sa↵ran, Aslin, & Newport 1996), the existence of linguistic universals common across radically di↵er- ent languages (Greenberg 1963) points to the pres- ence of innate constraints on such learning. Without such constraints, it becomes difficult to explain why there are few, if any, Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) languages (van Everbroeck, 1999) even though in principle such a language appears to be as good as any other. In this paper, we propose that these con- straints may arise from non-linguistic limitations on the sequential learning of statistical structure, and examine how this perspective may shed light on how children learn to map the words in sentences onto their appropriate grammatical roles. There are two major ways in which languages signal syntactic rela- tionships and grammatical roles—word order (WO), and case markings. In a strict WO language like En- glish, declarative sentences follow a Subject-Verb- Object (SVO) pattern. It is the occurrence of the subject in the first position, and the object in the second, that allows the hearer to comprehend who did what to whom. In contrast, languages such as Russian or Japanese allow multiple word orders and rely on case markings to disambiguate subjects from objects. For instance, Masha lubit Petyoo (SVO), Petyoo lubit Masha (OVS), and Lubit Petyoo Masha (VOS) are all grammatical in Russian and all mean Mary loves Peter (albeit with di↵erent emphases on the constituents), due to the nominative -a, and ac- cusative -u case markers. While long-standing theories describe acquisition of language through an innate language acquisition device (e.g., Pinker, 1995), an alternative approach that is gaining ground is the adaptation of linguistic structures to the human brain rather than vice versa (e.g., Christiansen, 1994; Kirby, 1998). On this ac- count, language universals may reflect non-linguistic cognitive constraints on learning and processing of sequential structure, rather than constraints pre- scribed by an innate universal grammar. Previ- ous work has shown that sequential-learning devices with no language-specific biases are better able to learn more universal aspects of language as com- pared to aspects encountered in rare languages (e.g., Ellefson & Christiansen, 2000; Christiansen & De- vlin, 1997; Van Everbroeck, 1999, 2001). Here, we examine the ways in which case markings and word order may function as cues for a sequen- tial learning device acquiring syntactic structure. In simulation 1, we model di↵erent word orders, and hypothesize that typologically common languages should be easier to learn by a sequential-learning device than the more rare ones. We expand on this idea in simulation 2 by studying the performance of networks trained on languages of varying degrees of case markings and flexibility. Finally, in simulation 3, we establish that our trained networks are able to mimic syntactic performance of children learn- ing English, Italian, Turkish, and Serbo-Croatian (Slobin and Bever, 1982).",

It has been proven that these resources can successfully improve students' learning (Dinov et al. 2008b). Being first published online in 2005, SOCR Analyses is a somewhat new component and it concentrate on data modeling for both parametric and non-parametric data analyses with graphical model diagnostics. One of the main purposes of SOCR Analyses is to facilitate statistical learning for high school and undergraduate students. As we have already implemented SOCR Distributions and Experiments, SOCR Analyses and Charts fulfill the rest of a standard statistics curricula. Currently, there are four core components of SOCR Analyses. Linear models included in SOCR Analyses are simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, one-way and two-way ANOVA. Tests for sample comparisons include t-test in the parametric category. Some examples of SOCR Analyses' in the non-parametric category are Wilcoxon rank sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman's test, Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and Fligner-Killeen test. Hypothesis testing models include contingency table, Friedman's test and Fisher's exact test. The last component of Analyses is a utility for computing sample sizes for normal distribution. In this article, we present the design framework, computational implementation and the utilization of SOCR Analyses.",

Among these challenges are the widening Intergenerational Information Technology (IIT) divide and the need for a comprehensive and balanced multidisciplinary training. In the past few years, it has become clear that one significant hurdle impedes the efforts to integrate information technology in the classroom - the Intergenerational IT divide. The IIT gap reflects a different growing misalignment between providers and recipients of the science and technology educational content in terms of the expected vs. supplied, needed vs. perceived and contextual vs. abstract specialized learning. The common K-12 teacher or college instructor is much less familiar with, and slower to adapt to, the new ether of communication and novel IT resources. The transfer and blending of data, research challenges and methodologies between diverse areas of science is also critical in motivating wider spectra of students, demonstrating cross-disciplinary methodological concepts and synergies, as well as for engaging students in research projects. This article discusses the problems faced by modern science educators and suggests some methods and vision for coping with the increasing IIT divide and the social need to train \"complete\" and broadly educated citizens.",

            "abstract": "Technology-based instruction represents a new recent pedagogical paradigm that is rooted in the realization that new generations are much more comfortable with, and excited about, new technologies. The free and Internetbased NSF-funded Statistics Online Computational Resource (www.SOCR.ucla.edu) provides a number of educational materials and interactive tools for enhancing instruction in various undergraduate and graduate courses in probability and statistics using observed or computer generated data. SOCR includes class notes, practice activities, statistical calculators, interactive graphical user interfaces, computational and simulation applets, tools for data analysis and visualization. Based on the promising results from our pilot study in 2005-2006, where we saw a consistent trend of improvement in the SOCR treatment group compared to the control group, in terms of quantitative examination measures, our 2006-2007 study involves over 300 UCLA students. We use a cross-over design for one course, (introduction to probability) taught by one instructor, and a randomized controlled study for two different courses (an introductory statistics course for the life sciences and an introductory course in probability). For the cross-over design course, SOCR-based and non SOCR-based activities or homework are assigned and analyzed relative to their performance. In the controlled study, one class uses SOCR the other does not. Several components of the SOCR-based materials are heavily dependent on simulated data to enhance the understanding on distributions, which is a major topic for the classes tested. Little is known about how interactive simulation based applets can enhance students’ learning, understanding and interest in statistics. As a result, separate questionnaires (Felder-Soloman Learning Style inventory, ATS survey, and entry and exit assessment of student knowledge questionnaire) are also collected separately to explore how SOCR affects the performance of students in relation to their learning style, attitudes towards statistics, prior knowledge and demographic characteristics, and reaction to these applets. The first goal of this study is to try to associate the effects of SOCR with students’ individual learning style based on the Felder-Silverman-Soloman index. How these applets assist students with different learning styles is yet to be observed. Our second goal is to assess students’ achievement with a closer look based on homework and activities directly related to SOCR. The students’ feedback and performances from this study tell us how to best optimize the SOCR resources based on their needs. Moreover, its result gives us a more accurate assessment of SOCR specifically and an assessment of internet-based resources in introductory and more advanced courses of statistics and probability.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental problem in medical imaging is to transport an atlas associated with a template image onto new data. This is sometimes achieved by registering (warping) the template to the data and using the induced (spatial) deformation field to impose an atlas on the data.There are a number of alignment techniques which bring two images in register; however, few studies have been done to quantitatively compare various warping methods. In this paper we compare different wavelet space thresholding schemes (uniform, spatially, and frequency adaptive, Bayesian) and develop two approaches for quantitative evaluation of the performance of three nonaffine warping techniques and one affine polynomial (12 parameter) registration on groups of data. The results of the affine and nonaffine warps are evaluated, both on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and on the corresponding functional positron emission tomography (PET) data using a quantitative approach based on the discrete wavelet transform. Using i...",
