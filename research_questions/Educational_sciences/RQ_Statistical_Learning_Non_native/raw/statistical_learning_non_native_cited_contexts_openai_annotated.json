Therefore, Spanish learners revert to the use of only duration as a cue to this vowel contrast in the second stage of their perceptual development. Morrison’s proposal relies on the specific properties of English /i7/ and /I/, and therefore it remains to be seen whether in his account duration reliance is also expected for the specific properties of the Dutch /]7/-/>/ contrast. Importantly, an implicit assumption within Morrison’s account is that Spanish monolinguals use allophonic vowel duration differences at least as a minor cue to vowel identification in Spanish, and therefore shares Kondaurova and Francis’ L1-transfer assumption. Escudero & Boersma, Kondaurova & Francis, and Morrison’s explanations rely on the status of vowel duration in the L1, i.e. while the former study suggests that Spanish does not use duration in vowel categorization, the latter two studies claim that the allophonic use of duration in Spanish can be transferred to the learning of vowel identity in the L2. Therefore, empirical data on the use of vowel duration in monolingual Spanish listeners is crucial to test these hypotheses. Morrison (2008b) showed that neither speakers of Peninsular Spanish, nor speakers of Mexican Spanish make use of duration in their vowel categorizations.",

Moreover, the AGL-SRT task was designed for the briefer periods of exposure typically associated with statistical learning studies and was applied towards investigating nonadjacency learning as it unfolded on-line. On the theoretical side, our results are consistent with the idea that the effect of linguistic experience on relative clause processing may be substantially mediated by mechanisms for statistical learning. But what kind of mechanism might be able to accommodate such learning? In a separate study, we found that associationbased learning may provide an appropriate candidate mechanism to capture the results of the current findings (Misyak et al., 2010). Computational simulations showed that SRNs were able to capture not only the mean performance trajectory of humans in the new AGL-SRT paradigm, but also the full and wide range of individuals’ corresponding off-line scores, without any manipulation of memory-related parameters. These computational results dovetail with previous SRN simulations that reproduced the SR/OR reading time patterns of low- and high-span individuals as a function of the amount of training exposure, again without manipulating memory (MacDonald and Christiansen, 2002). The SRN simulations further predicted that ORs should be differentially affected by increased exposure to relative-clause sentences, independently of working memory capacity. Wells et al. (2009) empirically confirmed this prediction in their human training study, showing that greater SR/OR reading experience (compared to that of a control condition) tuned reading time profiles towards resembling those of high-span individuals and qualitatively fit the performance of the aforementioned SRNs after the most training exposure.",

Morgan (1996) found that 9-month-old infants were more sensitive to trochaic rhythm as a cue to syllable coherence than they were to iambic rhythm, whereas 6-month-old infants seemed to be equally attentive to both kinds of rhythm as a cue to syllable coherence. This finding suggests that even after infants begin to attend to stress in relation to word segmentation, they require experience with language before they show the metrical segmentation strategy adults and older infants use. It may be that awareness of stress cues and awareness of statistical cues develop in parallel, with infants attending to each preferentially at different points in time. Infants may use statistical segmentation as a primary cue early in segmentation and attend more to stress cues later, after they have had sufficient exposure to words in isolation to learn about the predominantly trochaic pattern of English words. If this is the case, then the main milestone in the development of infants’ word segmentation is the integration of these cues, so that infants can take advantage of multiple, partly redundant cues instead of fixating primarily on one. Morgan and Saffran (1995) demonstrated that older infants are more likely to attend to multiple cues to word segmentation and to attempt to integrate them than are younger (6-month-old) infants.

Even after infants begin to use stress as a cue to syllable coherence, they do not attend solely to the trochaic pattern of English. Morgan (1996) found that 9-month-old infants were more sensitive to trochaic rhythm as a cue to syllable coherence than they were to iambic rhythm, whereas 6-month-old infants seemed to be equally attentive to both kinds of rhythm as a cue to syllable coherence. This finding suggests that even after infants begin to attend to stress in relation to word segmentation, they require experience with language before they show the metrical segmentation strategy adults and older infants use. It may be that awareness of stress cues and awareness of statistical cues develop in parallel, with infants attending to each preferentially at different points in time. Infants may use statistical segmentation as a primary cue early in segmentation and attend more to stress cues later, after they have had sufficient exposure to words in isolation to learn about the predominantly trochaic pattern of English words. If this is the case, then the main milestone in the development of infants’ word segmentation is the integration of these cues, so that infants can take advantage of multiple, partly redundant cues instead of fixating primarily on one. Morgan and Saffran (1995) demonstrated that older infants are more likely to attend to multiple cues to word segmentation and to attempt to integrate them than are younger (6-month-old) infants.",

Dietrich, Swingley and Werker (2004) compared English- and Dutch-learning infants of 10 to 12 months of age (the age beyond which infants typically discriminate non-native contrasts) on their ability to discriminate a vowel length distinction that is phonemic in Dutch but not in English.",

Kuhl’s (1993) Native Language Magnet (NLM) model uses acoustic cues rather than gestural phonology as the source of information available to the listener in speech perception studies. The primary tenets of the theory are that categories are defined by clusterings in multidimensional space and that repeated experience listening to speech helps create a category structure defined by good and poor exemplars. This emerging category structure leads first to asymmetries in discrimination and later to a collapsing of non-native categories into native ones. The essence of NLM is that an asymmetry in perception is predicted, with poorer performance if the central instance is used as the standard in discrimination studies than if a peripheral instance is used as the standard. Both of these models focus on speech perception. They are not designed to link speech perception to word learning. Moreover, neither explicitly addresses how indexical information is integrated into speech perception (although Kuhl, 1993, does compare the use of phonetic to nonphonetic information). Finally, although both models are based on similarity-matching metrics, neither provides an explicit account of what the underlying psychological or learning process might be that allows the child to evaluate similarity. PRIMIR proposes that the learning mechanism is statistical learning. In reminder, PRIMIR points to the distributional learning demonstrated by Maye et al.

Moreover, the level of difficulty of the distracter task affects how much learning is interfered with (Toro et al., 2005). It appears, then, that constraints can come from how the learning mechanisms interact with aspects of modality-specific perceptual processing or information processing more generally. Another factor interacting with statistical learning, and the one we investigate here, is prior knowledge. Studies investigating word segmentation in infants have shown that older infants may ignore TPs when they conflict with learned probabilistic cues to word boundaries that exist in the infant’s native language. For example, Thiessen and Saffran (2003) found that, when forced to choose, 6-month-olds will use TPs for word segmentation while 9-month-olds privilege the stress pattern that is characteristic of English bisyllabic words (strong–weak). Infants were exposed to a speech stream in which the syllable pairs with high between-syllable transitional probabilities exhibited a weak–strong stress pattern (the opposite of the preferred English pattern). The younger infants showed a pattern consistent with previous experiments; they segmented out the syllable pairs with high transitional probabilities. The older infants showed a quite different pattern. They segmented out items with lower syllable TPs but with the dominant English word-internal stress pattern. In a related study, Johnson and Jusczyk (2001) found that by 8 months of age, infants weigh co-articulation information more heavily than TPs.",

Endress and Bonatti and Pe~na et al.’s tasks were designed to test whether participants acquired sublexical rules, and generalized them to new items. The materials in this study focused on distributional regularities across words, rather than within words; it is not immediately clear how their proposed mechanisms would handle our materials. In addition, the rule-learning mechanism they propose is specifically intended to handle generalization beyond the input, which we did not test. Instead, we asked whether participants detected both the deterministic non-adjacent structure and the probabilistic adjacent structure, a question that required interrogating the specific words and structures presented during familiarization. The fact that a substantial number of participants learned both adjacent and non-adjacent structures suggests that participants did not simply attend to either the adjacent relationships or the non-adjacent relationships but were able to track them both simultaneously and/or switch between them flexibly. It was not the case, for these participants, that the much stronger non-adjacent relationship caused participants to stop tracking the weaker adjacent statistics or that the presence of informative adjacent structure prevented the deployment of attentional resources to the non-adjacent structure. This finding is consistent with the results from Mintz (2002), who demonstrated categorization of words based on their co-occurrence in particular A_B frames. The current results suggest that participants can identify both the correct A_B frames and which X words were most likely to appear in those frames. Learning both of these structures would be required for successful categorization of words based on frequent frames. The confidence ratings illuminated further differences between participants’ knowledge of the non-adjacent and adjacent structures, with participants rating themselves more confident on their answers to the Non-adjacent items than the Adjacent items. Interestingly, the difference in salience of the two structures did not lead to differences in learnability. It is not surprising that the non-adjacent structure was more salient to participants than the adjacent structure: The non-adjacent structure was deterministic, and each A_B frame was far more frequent than any particular AXB string.
