CELEX	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00953	https://doi.org/10.30019/IJCLCLP.200102.0003	The CELEX dataset is used to analyze syllable structures in spoken English, providing frequency and distribution data for words ranging from mono- to pentasyllabic. Researchers employ this dataset to study the phonological patterns and lexical properties of English, focusing on how syllable structure varies across different word lengths. This enables detailed linguistic analysis and supports research into phonology and morphology.
Time Magazine Corpus	https://doi.org/10.1177/1367006919876356	https://doi.org/10.1037/a0022256	The Time Magazine Corpus is used to study statistical learning in non-native speakers, focusing on how frequency effects influence lexical access during reading. Researchers analyze high-frequency and low-frequency nouns to understand these dynamics, employing the corpus to explore specific linguistic patterns and their impact on reading comprehension.
CHILDES database	https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d387a92c63508d9c249657abc4a42d8fb53f3933	https://doi.org/10.2307/416745	The CHILDES database is used to analyze the frequency of German words, specifically the 1,000 most frequent, to create a pool of 12 German syllables for use as speech stimuli in statistical learning research. This dataset enables researchers to focus on the linguistic elements that are most common in natural language, facilitating studies on how these elements are processed and learned.
