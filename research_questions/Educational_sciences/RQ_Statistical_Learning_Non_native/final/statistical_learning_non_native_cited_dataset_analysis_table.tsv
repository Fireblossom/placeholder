CELEX	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00953	https://doi.org/10.1524/stuf.1964.17.16.51	The CELEX dataset is used to analyze syllable structures in spoken English, providing frequency and distribution data for words ranging from monosyllabic to pentasyllabic. This dataset supports linguistic research by offering detailed phonological information, enabling studies on syllable structure and word frequency in spoken language.
Dialang	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2009.07.006	https://doi.org/10.1191/0265532205lt310oa	The Dialang dataset is used to assess the general listening comprehension skills of L1-Spanish L2-Dutch listeners through a standardized language assessment system. It focuses on evaluating performance in listening tasks, providing insights into second language acquisition and proficiency. The dataset enables researchers to analyze specific listener performance metrics, contributing to the development and validation of language testing methodologies.
Gleason, Perlmann, and Greif (1984)	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2008.04.002	https://doi.org/10.2307/325028	The Gleason, Perlmann, and Greif (1984) dataset is used to examine language acquisition patterns, focusing on conversational exchanges and pragmatic aspects of communication. Researchers employ this dataset to analyze how children develop language skills in social contexts, using it to explore specific pragmatic elements and conversational dynamics. This dataset provides detailed records of interactions, enabling nuanced investigations into the pragmatic dimensions of language learning.
King and Just (1991) data	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00031		The King and Just (1991) dataset is used to analyze reaction time patterns in the processing of relative clauses, specifically examining how experience influences cognitive processing. This involves methodologies that focus on measuring and interpreting reaction times to understand the impact of linguistic experience on cognitive mechanisms. The dataset enables researchers to explore how varying levels of experience affect the speed and efficiency of language processing, providing insights into the cognitive underpinnings of language comprehension.
